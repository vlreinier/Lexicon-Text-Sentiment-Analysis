1.0~you've got to be kidding me, PLEASE tell me you're kidding me LoveCoates Sign in Permalink aside from the upside-down kiss (movie-history moment) -- this is the cheesiest movie ive ever seen ever in my life. no, seriously. why, you ask? the scene where tobey is bouncing off the walls, flipping with hang-time beating up the high school bully in front of a crowd of people...and no one says a word about how strange it is? willem dafoe's costume...ahahahahahahaahhahahahahahaha. i have halloween costumes from 3rd grade that are more scary. the dialogue...must have been written by the same people who do "Barney" and "Pokemon" the green goblin...why does he do anything? we never find out. he's mad at his boss. ok, he gets him...then he's mad at world, apparently...why? the scene where the green goblin WHO HAS BEEN TRYING DESPERATELY TO FIND OUT WHO SPIDERMAN IS knocks him unconscious...then doesn't take off his mask????

8.0~a very watchable movie with one or two (castasideable) flaws!!!! skips_r_nice Sign in Permalink The movie begins with suspense and, in a good way, it ends with it too! leaving the path fully paved for spidey 2! However, the effects were, to put it nicely, absolute pants. especially when compared to some other excellent special effects movies out atm! (take gollum:LOTR, x men, daredevil, pirates...) At times, this was irritating and made the movie seem a little kiddish and cartoony! Not exactly what i was expecting!!! Also, kirsten dunsts acting was ssssooooo overly dramatic, she was starting to remind me of someone from eastenders!!! Apart from this, tobey maguire was (as ever) fantastic, carrying his role as web spinning, lycra wearing spidey (how did he make that suit!) with class, emotion, action, and humour! This along with the spectacular Willem Defoe (GREEN GOBLIN) made the movie incredibly watchable and thoroughly entertaining! i give it 6/10! Watch this if you liked: the spidey cartoons daredevil x men it's one of those late night after a party movies or a sunday afternooner!!! great for chillin out!!!!

8.0~Move Over, Superman! Spidey is Here! pied Sign in Permalink I loved the authentic New York City setting of Spiderman so appropriate after 9/11. Toby Mcguire did a outstanding job as Peter Parker. The story builds slowly but inexorably as Peter slowly morphs into Spiderman. Peter lives with his elderly aunt and uncle. The uncle, played by Cliff Robertson tells Peter prophetically, "With great power comes great responsibility." Small children might be scared of the Green Goblin, frighteningly played by William Defoe. Very enjoyable movie.
10.0~Best movie ever and it was when I was a child it is now I'm an adult gurayskyman Sign in Permalink Say what you want about super hero movies, that they're goofy or they lack realism or whatever really. Spiderman is none of those things. This is a movie about heart and soul. This is a movie about choices. Making the right ones and wrong ones. The older I get the more I appreciate this movie. A masterpiece and I don't know if anything will come close to the emotional power this movie has.
6.0~Enjoyable, but not a "true" Spiderman eldergod-1 Sign in Permalink "Spiderman" was an enjoyable flick, with a decent visual effects and some nice moments, but overall it was not very impressive. The first big NO-NO in the movie is Toby as Peter Parker. Nothing personal against the actor, he actually played quite well, but he is not for this character. He is more fit for Harry Osborn and John Franco would have been an ideal Spiderman. Kirsten Dunst was not too great, too. The bad guy was OK, although he was too intense from the beginning, while in the comic books Norman was just a corrupt businessman. Apart from this, the film is quite good. The story is slow-moving but interesting, it is well shot and the battles between Spidey and The Green Goblin were very well made. Also there were some classic moments as the Goblin disguised as an old woman or the people, turned into skeletons and then killed. Unfortunately, the sequel of this film is quite stupid.
10.0~This movie was better than expected. A must see. Excellent special effects JeffMovi Sign in Permalink This is a must see movie for fans of Spiderman, Stan Lee and Marvel Comics. In the movie instead of making web shooter Peter Parker has been given the power to shoot spider webs from his wrists. Much better than the animated series.
10.0~Perfect cast Bjorjam Sign in Permalink I'm not necessarily a comic book fan, but I really enjoyed this film. It offered some elements of surprise, romance, action, and adventure. I personally think Peter Parker as a person and superhero has a little bit more substance than the ever-familiar Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent. This movie kind of gave the viewer a different perspective of how superheros are born. Plus, the special effects were quite good! When was the last time you saw a convincing person climb a building without the "hidden" wire-line of falsety? For those of you that know the story, "Spiderman" (or Peter Parker) was your typical picked-on teen. The director of this film was right on the money by casting Tobey Maguire as the web-spinning wonder. I can't think of a single actor who could have been more convincing as a spacey geek, introvert, romantic, pretty-boy, and superhero. My first complaint is in regards to Kirsten Dunst. Her character was a little styolized, but still convincing. Her red hair for this picture was a bit of a distraction, but it was a minor oversight. Another minor little thing is the fact that Willem Dafoe's character (although he makes for an excellent villian) could have been more developed. But all in all, Spiderman was a job well done. A definite must-see for everyone.
10.0~Maybe Shaky...but STRONG! pivot1 Sign in Permalink Before I start...I hated Batman....thought X-men was just okay. and I'm a HUGE comic fan. with that said... Spider-man was a GREAT comic to movie adaptation. It's not made for fans alone, but everyone who might associate with life and regrets. I'll keep my views short... Whereas, I heard the effects were shabby and the story was amazing... this is only slightly true. Spider-man's look was greatly acceptable, the story wonderful, BUT THE DIALOG (in places...especially between Peter and MaryJane) GOD awful. Would the person who wrote those lines actually say them?!?! If so, no wonder they're a hermit. The fight scenes we're ALL the X-men should have been- visual and personal. My last comment is on the score. Mr. Elfman- can you resell the same tired melodies one more time? Please, retire to dramas... Overall, I loved it... if all us comic fans excepted Burton's satire called 'Batman' then we should all rejoice at what Raimi has handed us. Thank You...
9.0~Would willingly pay non-matinee price SuzieBorgt Sign in Permalink I really liked Spider-man. The combination of action, love story, and the rest was great. I saw additional sides to Willem Dafoe, Tobey Mcguire, and Kirsten Dunst. These three actors give hope to the future of acting. I liked the silencing effect when trouble was about to happen. I appreciated the scenes when he was learning how to use his spider powers. Even though the triangle between Harry Osborn, Peter, and Norman Osborn wasn't expanded upon very greatly, I'm sure it'll get treated more thoroughly in a future sequel. Great movie!!!
5.0~avarage djparkes Sign in Permalink The film the fans have been waiting for should have been the tagline for this film. Only a fan could forgive Sam Raimi the basic mistakes, which made this okay start to the spiderman film franchise nearly mediocre. Tobey Maguire is superb and does come across as a near perfect Peter parker and could have been drawn straight from the mind of Stan Lee (who puts in a great cameo). William Defeo brilliantly hams it up as the psycho Green Goblin, and the rest of the cast work well with what they've been given. I must give a thumbs up to J.K Simmons he was J. Jonah Jameson to perfection, Please come back for the next movies. So with all this praise for the actors what went wrong? The script for one thing, it had moments of genius the scene with Peter being ripped off by the fight promoter up to the confrontation with uncle Ben's killer. The scene where Spiderman takes out the armoured car robbers and poses for the camera going off, and any scene, which involved J.J.Jameson. See the pattern, any scene that the writers took straight out of the comics worked perfectly the scenes they tried to write themselves didn't. Then there's the effects directors and studios need to learn that super-fast moving humans/superheroes don't look good yet when done by computers, take Blade2 (fight scene in the warehouse with Danny john-Jules) and Harry Potter (Quiddich match) The scenes with Spiderman swinging through the city were great. To sum up. This is a okay film if only for some superb acting but its a fan film and doesn't appeal to a wider audience and may leave a lot of people disappointed. Hopefully the 2nd film will be better but the studio should not expect it to be as big as this one.
6.0~Good but not the best.. MarvelFan123 Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is a superhero that was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko and was published by Marvel Comics making his first appearance in Amazing Fantasy #15 in 1962. Since the character gripped most people's attention, he had his own comic book series which was named "Amazing Spider-Man" and from that point on, Spider-Man became one of the most popular superheroes around to this day. When this film came out, people were stoked! The action, the cast, it was just a phenomenal flick! It sounds like Sam Raimi nailed it right? All is good in the land of Spider-Man. Unfortunately, no...I wanted to come out here and say that. While I don't think that it's bad per say, I don't it's the strongest out of Marvel's works either. I'm a big fan of Spider-Man comics and I've been reading them ever since I was about 5 years old and as a result, I wasn't allowed to see this film due to the fact it was rated 12 back in those times. But I'll tell you why that this film is not the best comic book adaptation ever made. The plot revolves around the main character Peter Parker. He goes to a genetics laboratory where he gets bitten by a genetically enhanced spider and gains spider-like abilities. He goes to a wrestling to get money to buy a car to impress the love of his life Mary Jane Watson. The promoter cheated him off but got robbed, Peter lets the robber go but doing so caused his Uncle Ben's life; he catches him and learn what Uncle Ben told him. Meanwhile, the owner of Oscorp Norman Osborn tries to preserve his military contract for his company because losing it will mean the end of his business. He goes to desperate measures as he experiments on himself with his company's new but unstable performing enhancing chemical paper that increases his speed, strength and stamina. Doing so allows him to go insane and he kills his board members at the world unity fair. Spider-Man and the Green Goblin encounter each other a few times and it's your simple good vs. evil story. First, I'll start with the casting. I'm so sorry but I don't like Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker. He was terrible in that role. Peter Parker is suppose to be this shy nerd and while he is a nerd, he does not act like a wimp in the comics. Peter is suppose to be smart, clever, witty and sarcastic and Tobey Maguire to be honest doesn't get across those apropriate aspects. He's also not good at doing emotional scenes like when he cries over Uncle Ben let's be honest. Also, when he gets bitten by the spider, he's suppose to have the ability to run fast and jump higher, then he builds his own web shooters. In this film however, they are natural, it just comes out of his wrist for some reason. Very odd... Instead of having Gwen Stacy as the love interest, we have Mary Jane Watson. I know that Peter and Mary Jane get together in the comics considering that I read them but Gwen Stacy was suppose to be his first love. Not only that, Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane makes me want to face palm, especially the dialogue that was written for her. Not to mention Gwen Stacy was suppose to be in that big climax where the Green Goblin let her go to fall to her death as it was done in the comics. Now onto Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn. He's not a bad choice to play Norman Osborn, he really looks like the part. But with his over the top performance as the Goblin, it gets really annoying. Plus, the costume is ridiculous and is not like the original comic book design. Are we suppose to take him seriously like that? Just by making him look like he's from the Power Rangers? Another thing that I would like to talk about is James Franco as Harry Osborn. I think he was underused throughout most of the film. When we get down to the end of the film, he now has a purpose to be in the trilogy. The script was written by David Koepp. He wrote both the story and the dialogue for this film, he's more of storyteller than a dialogue writer. I think he was trying to go for the comic books but it's suppose to be a comic book adaptation that takes it seriously. Now onto the good points. The action sequences were fun to look at. Granted, the special effects were terrible like they were cutscenes straight from an early PS2 Game but they were good for their time. Sure, Spider-Man looked like a cartoon while web-swinging but it was 2002 so I'll give it a pass. I liked the performances by Rosemary Harris as May Parker even though her dialogue was pretty bad. I just loved J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson! He was just SPOT...ON! He played the character perfectly like the J. Jonah Jameson in the Amazing Spider-Man comic book series! I also really liked the music composed by Danny Elfman. The theme really sticks to my head even to this day! Plus, we have a brief but good cameo from Spider-Man co-creater Stan The Man Lee. Aside from the flaws I mentioned, I think the story was OK, simple and straightforward. Overall, I say Spider-Man was OK. It's not that great, it's just overrated. Just because I liked it doesn't everything in this film was good. I like the action sequences, I like the soundtracks and the cast that really stand out the most for me was James Franco, Rosemary Harris and J.K Simmons. General audience who never read The Amazing Spider-Man comics will be totally amused by this film but Spider-Man and comic book fans will be disappointed. 6/10
1.0~This was good, no maybe okay at best james_dean9800 Sign in Permalink I don't usually write something about of movie, unless it really bothers me. And in this case boy was i bothered. I never read the spider-man comic books or saw any of the cartoons, i mean I'm better than that. But back to the movie, for the fact the so many people went to see it on opening weekend,i expected that it would be amazing, boy i was wrong. Sure the orignal idea for spiderman was to have a loser kid transform into this amazingly freakish superhero, but why Toby. Not that I have anything wrong with him, he's still a good actor, but after you take the glasses off spiderman deserves to be cooler,James Franco, would have been better for godsakes. But back to the actual movie. I see everyone forgetting this movie by next summer. I feel the story was tragically flawed. The plot just really weak. The only time I was actually glad while watching this movie was when i saw Willem Dafoe, but most of the time he had a horribly ridiculous mask on. Nothing in the movie hopped out and hit me with amazement, even the graphic, they were good but it's nothing I havent seen before. Well to sum it up, the plot was predictable, the action lacked horribly, the graphics were par, and the best acting game into play in the form of Dafoe, with that ridiculous outfit. Overall i would like to tell everyone that its not worth the hype and i wished i waited for it on video. For those who say its the best comic book movie since Superman, you don't know your ass from your elbow. Both superman and batman, were far superior. I gave it a 6, just because i liked the opening theme song. Oh yea it was great seeing Macho Man again, he was so good in Ready to Rumble (If you can't pick on the sarcasm you are a fool)And you see this in the theater you are a fool too.
10.0~Oh my god. tune1981 Sign in Permalink This is a must see movie for fans and anyone who has never watched the cartoon or read the comics this is a great start. Roll on 2 and 3. Best bit in the film, at school the fight with flash! Pure genus (get it)!
6.0~Film Action with heart simon-fredriksson Sign in Permalink Director Sam Raimi has really managed to turn the comic to film action with a big heart and just the right feel for the genre. Tobey Maguire, a bit woody, benefit from it in the role of the bespectacled nerd who becomes superhero. Kirsten Dunst radiates a kind of cute sensuality in the role of a girl next door who he loves. And Willem Dafoe overshoot well as the charismatic villain Green Goblin. Admittedly, some action scenes is furiously skillfully made, but the fourth plus absent, sometimes it's a little too much computer games feeling of the film. Was followed by two films with the same actor/director.
7.0~pleasantly surprised halderic Sign in Permalink having been an avid spider-man reader in my younger days, i was looking forward to the theatrical adaptation ever since i heard it was in the making. i wasnt expecting much, i did not want to get my hopes up too high only to be let down. when i heard toby maguire was to play spidey i was apprehensive, i liked the idea of him as peter parker, but spider-man? when i heard kirsten dunst was to play mary jane watson i cursed from anger over what i thought was a bad casting decision. having seen the movie as earliest as i could i can honestly say i was wrong, and the movie was very entertaining. maguire was perfect as both teenage peter parker and wisecracking spider-man. and dunst was surprisingly good as mary jane (i just couldnt see it in the trailers). the plot is admittedly simple and not in depth in the least, but thats okay, as long as the movie is strong enough in other areas, and it is. character development is fairly strong throughout, especially with peter parker and mary jane. alot of emotions are expressed and dealt with, its not all flash and glitter. norman osborne (aka green goblin) isnt developed as much as one would hope, but he plays it very well, especially in scenes where hes losing his sanity. i had issues about the revamped metallic green goblin suit, i just didnt like it before, and im not crazy about it now, but that can be overlooked in the long run. the supporting cast was pretty goood, especially j jonah jameson, he nailed down the comic book spirit. the special effects are mostly well done. some scenes had me bubbling with excitement over how exact spider-mans moves matched the classic comic book poses. i loved the touches. at times the effects looked like digital effects, but what do you expect? this is not a movie to critique on believability (is that a word?). is this a perfect movie? nope, but for what it is, its very well made with nice touches of humanity added to the characters. and thats refreshing in this genre of film. is this an entertaining movie befitting the web slinger we all love? YOU BETCHA TRUE BELIEVERS!
8.0~Spider-Fun eforest77 Sign in Permalink I'm gonna say it right here, I'm a HUGE Spider-Man fan. He's my favourite superhero of all time. So, being such a big fan, I, of course, had to watch the movie adaption. Surprisingly, I didn't actually see it in theatres - I wasn't old enough at the time, or maybe my parents just didn't take me to go see it. Who knows. So, finally watching it, I gotta say...it is SO an early 2000s movie. There's this one scene, where it's just a shot of Spidey (played by Tobey Maguire, which was an interesting choice) from just a bit below his shoulders and up. He's against a bright New York Cityscape sunset. And he raises his hand and does the websling motion... ...and it looked so BAD I burst out laughing. You know, that laugh where you feel kinda bad for laughing? Yeah? That one. It looked SO dated, it was humorous. Most of the other special effects were pretty decent, if nothing special. This is a fun superhero movie. It's nothing more than that, to be honest. And it did have some problems with it. First off, the dialogue between Spidey and his big villain, Green Goblin (played by Willem Dafoe) was just so cheesy and forced. There's a part where Green Goblin sings "Itsy Bitsy Spider". I'm serious. My second problem with it is that so much about Spidey was changed in the movie. Looking back, now knowing more about Spidey than ever, I see so many problems. First off, where's Gwen Stacy? Part of me just thinks the writer was scared to kill her off, so she wasn't put in. Oh well. Secondly, Spider-Man's webslingers. Or, rather, his lack-there-of. Spider-Man NEEDS his webslingers - it's an integral part of his character, showing the intelligence of Peter Parker. That's a big problem in this movie - Spider-Man doesn't seem smart, at all. This continues into the other films, so be warned. I thought the suit was fine, but the white webbing as opposed to the black was kind of strange. Come to think of it, what else is Red, White, and Blue? A flag...of a country...a very powerful country... That's right! France! Subliminal messaging, people. Subliminal messaging. Anyways, if you like Spider-Man, be sure to check this out. It's great fun.
8.0~Look out, here comes the Spider-Man! sme_no_densetsu Sign in Permalink "Spider-Man" was one of the movies that really got the ball rolling for superheroes on film. Kicked around Hollywood for years, Spider-Man finally hit the big screen in the summer of 2002 and became a huge hit. It has spawned two sequels so far and has helped to pave the way for a bevy of comic book films (most of which pale in comparison). The story begins with teenage social outcast Peter Parker, who, following a bite from a genetically enhanced spider, gains super powers and is presented with the question of what he is going to do with his newfound abilities. The story sticks close to the comic book origin and does a fine job of setting up the character's personal struggles. These struggles have always been integral to the character because they help to make Spider-Man more human and therefore more identifiable. Thankfully, the producers assembled an enviable cast to populate this story. Tobey McGuire, Kirsten Dunst & James Franco, despite their relative youth, already had some fine performances to their credit and do not disappoint here. Then there's two-time Oscar nominee Willem Dafoe, who really sinks his teeth into his villainous dual role. The film also features Oscar winner Cliff Robertson as Peter's uncle Ben and Oscar nominee Rosemary Harris as his aunt May. J.K. Simmons is also memorable in his role as cigar-chomping newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson. Director Sam Raimi does a good job of bringing the story to life, ably handling both the dramatic elements and the action set-pieces. The special effects are well handled, as is Danny Elfman's score. I could nitpick and say that a few things are perhaps a little too comic book-ish but that seems inappropriate. Overall, the film's mix of action and drama is a cut above the usual superhero fare. In any case, I've seen the movie at least four or five times, including twice in theatres, so that should give an idea of the film's lasting appeal.
9.0~Exceeded all expectations saulville Sign in Permalink I just got out of an advanced screen of the film... I cant say anything bad... From the second the Marvel Logo Popped up at the top of the film to the closing credits, I smiled. I am not a comic book superfan but I did grow up on Spiderman and his Amazing friends saturday morning. And I really felt like that child again watching this film. All the characters were very rich and colorful and not cheesy like some other comic book to film characters have been. highly recommend......even if there are long lines. If you have a choice between taking the family to episode II or Spiderman......Go See Your Friendly Neigborhood Spider-Man!
6.0~great entertainment, ok film ladymizu Sign in Permalink tons of fun. however, the dialogue is stiff at some places and corny at others. mary jane is eye candy, but that's about all there is to her. nevertheless, there are some good acting (peter's uncle and spidey). tobey mcguire is excellent, and is the most positive thing about the movie. his peter is charming and real. i have lots of favorite scenes from the movie, and all involves mr spidey: "go web!" scene, and the first spidey-outfit appearance (the total dud one). hilarious! worth your money if you're looking for a good time. may be the only thing new worth seeing at the moment.
6.0~Stunningly MEDIOCRE Sithlord-20 Sign in Permalink Contains Spoilers Having just returned from a 2nd viewing of "Spider-Man" (I initially saw it on its opening day of May 3), I was appalled how poorly this film holds up upon repeat visits. The first time I found it exciting, though not spectacular. The second time, I spent more time checking my watch and snickering at the movie's inadequacies than I did losing myself in this comic book world. The truth is that "Spider-Man" is riddled with inconsistencies, plot holes and uninspired characters. Those who think that the dialogue in "Attack of the Clones" is bad should revisit the marble-mouthed conversations here. Peter's rambling to Mary Jane in Aunt May's hospital room is absolutely atrocious, as are most of their scenes together. For the sake of brevity I will not list all the inconsistencies in the plot, but here are a few: Uncle Ben's "Great Power" Speech - Where did this come from? What great power? Peter is a science geek all his life, then he knocks one guy down at school and all of a sudden he's got great power? I think not. Uncle Ben's Killer - The criminal steals from two people: one is a burly middle aged wrestling promoter from whom he steals thousands of dollars, the other is a decrepit old man from whom he steals a rolling wreck of a car. So he only pistol whips the promoter, but has to shoot the old man? Yeah, that makes sense. Pumpkin Bombs - Capable of vaporizing human flesh, yet when one explodes six inches from Peter's face in the finale, it only tears up half his mask. Guess latex renders them powerless. Right. But the major failing of the film is this: TO WHOM IS THE GREEN GOBLIN A THREAT? His paramount concern is stopping a corporate merger? My God, how will the world ever recover?! Where is the grandiose scheme that makes the world recoil in fear? Lex Luthor wanted to sink California into the ocean. Magneto tried to turn every resident of New York City into a mutant. The Joker tried to kill the residents of Gotham with poison (twice!). But the Goblin? He's got a board of directors as his nemesis. Pathetic. Which is not to say "Spider-Man" is all bad. The film is well cast with capable acting performances. J. Jonah Jameson is hilarious and some of the action scenes are genuinely exciting. The CGI works (for the most part) and Danny Elfman contributes a rousing score. But I get the feeling that every time I will see this movie in the future, I'll find more things wrong with it. What a shame. Rating: 6/10
10.0~The Amazing "Spider-Man". NJRocker091188 Sign in Permalink I'm not into comic books I have read some of them for Spider-Man but I'm not a comic book freak, And I did use to watch the Cartoons. When I saw the movie it didn't blow my mind but, I did very much enjoy it. I consider Spider-Man as a better hero then batman, and Superman. Spider-Man along with X-Men are really the only Super Hero Movies/ Cartoons that I paid attention too. Spider-Man had great action, the plot in my personal judgment was good, dialog was good and the introduction to Peter Parker, his life and how he became Spider-Man was well done and well shown. Before Peter Parker became Spider-Man he had no chance with any one and then he was given an gift. A Gift that would change his life. Because of his gift he was able to get the girl that he likes to notice him. Although she did not know that Spider-Man and Peter are the same person it still lead Peter to be closer to Marry Jane. Because of his Uncle Bean's death Peter began to realize the responsibility of being a Super Hero and he became a stronger person. When he meet "The Green Goblin" whom became his arch enemy he then had to find out a way to defeat him and still stay on top as New York's Super Hero. In which Goblin was making the hard but tossing bombs around and threading Peter's loved ones. Spider-Man was a thrill to watch, and I left the movie theater with excitement. It was great action fun.
1.0~Pathetic jforkix Sign in Permalink I must say, this is the worst super hero movie I have ever seen. It was dumb and unnecessary sentimental. The special effects were very ordinary and a lot of times it was very obvious that it was animation rather than the actual guy. Having grown up seeing the likes of movies like superman (which btw was done much more professionally decades ago) I had so much expectation when I went in. I used to watch the spiderman cartoon regularly and that was way better than this multi-million dollar fiasco.
7.0~Swing baby swing! smakawhat Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi has created one enjoyable ride. It seems without question after watching Spider-man that Raimi is a comic book fan. This film litteraly plays out like the so many paneled stories in the Spiderman series, and even the shots look like art work taken from many of the books. A particular shot of Spider-man getting hit with a grenade seems like a drawing lifted from the artists pages. The casting is quite good. Maguire who is usualy bad as a leading man excels here cause Peter Parker is a young kid who is cocky yet very unsure about the weight and burden now put on him with his new superpowers. This forces Maguire to take the role of a person who doesn't have a lot of confidence but must do what is right, and it suits him very well. Dunst is fine as Mary Jane, and who can't like Dafoe as the Green Goblin. Also while I knew the story of Spiderman's origin, Raimi gives the audience plenty of suspense in telling the already familiar story. Some of the acting between Mary Jane and Parker is a bit contrived, maybe sometimes even a little long winded, but at least they have a chemistry on screen. It also looks like they created the most memorable on screen kiss this year so far... Also the swinging special effects look neat, can't say I've seen anything like it before and it's very refreshing. But what would be even more refreshing would have been to have more J Jonah JAMESON!!! Man that actor was a scream!!! If anything he captured the spirit of this film, "dumb fun". Rating 7.5 out of 10
10.0~Sam Raimi keeps up his image Zenzou Sign in Permalink First thing I have to say is that Sam Raimi is one of my all-time favorite directors! In Spider-man, I loved how he kept a lot of the comic book facts and changed some to better suit real-life and the character Peter Parker (i.e. has genetically built-in web shooters instead of built ones he makes). Furthermore, all of the cast does a great job of portraying the enemies and friends of Spidey, Toby Maguire was perfect for his part. The storyline hints towards a sequel and supplies a great ending. All in all, Sam Raimi's Spider-man is another movie that will be added onto my list of favorite movies alongside Army of Darkness!
6.0~ehhh..it was...o..k? nivek_nailgun Sign in Permalink Quick rundown...the acting was well done,the casting was well done...the effects were well done...so what's my problem with it? The Green Goblin was so ridiculous looking to me I couldn't get around it. Not Willam DaFoe himself but rather the foolish costume they put him into. The Goblin glider was very good but what were they thinking with that costume? Another quibble with it I had was that the story didn't grip me at all. Being a Spidey fan for a long time now I knew nearly everything that would happen. If companies are going to tell these stories,they've got to have at least a few plotline surprises for the old time fans. Not a huge complaint enough to ruin it for me but I didn't really mind the whole 'Make Spidey a mutant' thing but I would have preferred had Peter Parker made his own web shooters,etc... XMen was a much better superhero adaptation.....and for the record,in print I'm a much bigger Spiderman fan than XMen.
10.0~Amazing, Spectacular, and..."What do you mean by Incredible?" mikmc Sign in Permalink This was a comic book brought to life, and as such was absolutely perfect. That, and the web-swinging in this movie is absolutely wonderful...well worth the price of admission for me.
10.0~Utterly Superb Webslinging Smash chaz143 Sign in Permalink Even though i am a grown man spider man is one of my favorite movies. I watch it over and over again for it has everything a film could ever want. It has a great cast including the likes of Toby Mcguire, Kirsten Dunst and William Defoe. It also manages to pull off being sad, frightening and wonderful all at the same time. For women who like love stories you will find what you want in a complicated love triangle with Peter Parker aka spiderman in love with his next door neighbour MJ who goes out with his best friend. Another great aspect of the film is the stunning computer graphics. It shows you just where our films really are today. And last but not least it is one of the only ever films to make me shed a tear and in my opinion is the best film ever made.
8.0~a world wide web....of fun ! chets808 Sign in Permalink Rather surprisingly, Spiderman has ushered in another generation of young movie-goers to summertime action like predecessors Batman (1989) and Superman (1978) previously did. Spiderman may share more in common with those movies than one would think. For nearly 10 years, all movie studios have been attempting to rekindle the summertime super-hero flame that was last seen in its full fury with 1989's Batman, but few have had the success that Spidey is apparently seeing. And that is not to say its undeserved, but rather unexpected. Columbia has several things in their favor on this one, namely, a veteran director and more importantly, no super-sized egos on the marquee (G.Clooney anyone ?). Tobey Maguire seems like a natural to play P.Parker but what I found a little surprising was how fetching Kirsten Dunst was as the love interest and Willem Dafoe's believably evil turn as the nemesis. All the pieces just seem to come together for this blockbuster (and for once, the name is appropriate), but unfortunately, if history is any indicator, this is as good as it will get: the sequels almost never hold up against the original so movie goers - enjoy it while you can !
9.0~Spider-Man miss-naza007 Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi, a known director for the movie: "Drag Me to Hell", brings yet another exciting movie to the big screen. I honestly didn't know what to expect since I hadn't read the comic book. Watching the film, I was amazed to see many familiar faces such as Tobey Maguire, who plays the protagonist of the movie- Peter Parker. Surprisingly, this movie turned out to be one of the best action films I've watched so far. The overall quality of acting was outstanding. Each person highly exceeds the expectations dictated by the plot. Never at one moment does any actor fail to deliver as their character. Being my first time of watching a movie directed by Raimi, I must say I'm overly impressed. Raimi undoubtedly knows how to spin a web of fast-paced action and admirable scenes of tension carefully designed with bits of suspense. He stands out as an exemplary creator of quality action films. The only minor let-down was the costuming of William Dafoe. I didn't really fancy the idea of the color of the costume being green, given that the color itself symbolizes growth and harmony. This goes in high contrast to the dangerous and intimidating vibe that his costume is supposed to give off. Despite the movie's minor shortcoming, Spider-Man is first-class, striking and exceptional--definitely worth a few hours of entertainment.
9.0~Can't wait for the sequel Judger Sign in Permalink My son works in a movie theatre and we were able to go to an advanced screening last night. Wow! It was kind of funny being a theater where they were smoking, drinking beer and eating Wendy's. It actually didn't bother me, despite being an old fart, I kind of enjoyed being with a rowdy crowd It was a terrific movie, a real crowd pleaser. If you don't like this film, you have no business being at a movie based on a comic book. The movie reminds you a little of the first Batman film, partly because Danny Elfman did the music for both films, partly because of the awesome use of visuals and a city as a virtual character in the story, and partly because of similarities in the storyline. Overall, this is a much better movie than Batman. It's witty, well acted, has state of the art special effects and puts the effects to the exactly the right use. Most of all, the movie captures the essence of the Comic. On the surface, Spider-man is just a blending of the Superman and Batman story. What made it unique, however, was that behind the hero was a less than super everyman who didn't always have his personal life in order and was misunderstood by the public. The film gets this just right, and has a lot of fun with it. The transformation of Parker from high school geek to Spidey is handled perfectly, with great humor. There is also a parallel transformation of upright businessman Norman Osborne into the insanely maniacal Green Goblin. In lesser hands, this could seem stupid and trite. Instead, the fast pace, great visuals, awesome score and solid acting make it easy to set aside the implausible premise and just enjoy the ride. The music and special effects should get top billing, but they aren't just thrown at you for their own sake. They are there to advance the story. The makers of this film were smart enough to employ an excellent cast, and give them just enough to do to make you care about the characters. The movie ends with the premise for the sequel all setup. I can hardly wait!
9.0~GREAT! KiM328 Sign in Permalink This is a really good movie! I really recommend it. The animations get a little fake-looking and some points but it is still very impressive. Tobey McGuire plays a great Peter Parker! Same goes for Kirsten Dunst on Mary Jane! The webs are great. Go see it~
2.0~Excellent SMLA11 Sign in Permalink I have seen this movie about 8 times now and I still think that it's good. Tobey Maguire is awesome as Peter Parker, a geek who gets super powers after being bitten by a genetically altered spider. Kirsten Dunst does good as Mary Jane and I enjoyed the kiss between her and Spiderman. Willem Dafoe is an excellent example of a great villain. He was awesome. The only problem I had with this is that it looked so fake. the computer animated was too strong, which isn't a good thing in my mind. Overall the movie is very cool and very interesting. Rating 10 out of 10.
7.0~Worth seeing, but not perfect rolfhub Sign in Permalink Well, I liked this one, but not as much as some other flicks I've seen. First of all, the main character, Peter Parker, is very believable as a nerd that isn't very well accepted by his fellow students, but gains super powers that he has to learn to handle and to use responsibly, which is of course not an easy task. I liked the other figures, too. What I didn't like that much, though, are some scenes that seem to be endlessly slow, which won't fit into the whole concept as a fast paced movie, but that is, of course, highly subjective. I you haven't seen this one yet, I can recommend it to you.
9.0~One of the Best Superhero Origin Stories Put To Film nmholland Sign in Permalink Spiderman is directed by Sam Raimi and stars Tobey Maguire as the awkward high school nerd Peter Parker. On a field trip to a science lab, Peter was bitten by a radioactive spider, and gained superhuman abilities of strength, reflexes, and heightened senses. He also now has the ability to stick to walls, and to shoot spider webs out of his wrists. When a new villain comes to town, a guy that calls himself the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), Peter must handle his nerdy high school life, all while trying to save the city and the girl he loves, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). Spiderman was one of the first Marvel films ever made, right behind X-Men (2000), and it literally made my childhood. I had Spiderman posters, bed sheets, window curtains, you name it. Spiderman was a very influential movie, and still holds up to day. People still love the original Raimi trilogy (or, the first two), and most like Tobey Maguire better than Andrew Garfield (no offense Garfield fans). This film is pretty close to perfect, and I'm here to tell you why. One of the best things this film can offer is the close to perfect casting. Although Maguire might not make the best Spiderman, he definitely fits the role of Peter Parker, the high school loser that can't get anything besides his grades right. James Franco as Harry Osborn was a great choice, and was much better than Dane DeHaan with a face full of acne. Kirsten Dunst was a pretty good choice for Mary Jane, although I could've seen some other actress dye her hair red and then scream for two hours. Willem Dafoe was an amazing choice for Norman Osborn, or Green Goblin, and handled that role with a lot of confidence and pulled it off nicely. However, the best casting choice was J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. I truly believe that this was one of the best casting choices made in a film, ever. Simmons played Jameson perfectly, and was a highlight in every film, even the third one, but we don't talk about that. Another great thing this movie pulls off is the direction and special effects. Sam Raimi is a great director, we all know that, but he does even better in these films than in the Evil Dead franchise. His work with the camera brings a feel to Spiderman that nobody else, including Marc Webb, could handle correctly. Now, the special effects in a couple parts look somewhat dated, but overall, they are really good. Most of them still hold up today, except for a couple shots here and there. The score is also an extreme highlight of the film, done masterfully by Danny Elfman. Not even the great James Horner could replicate what Elfman did, when it came time to make The Amazing Spiderman (2012). The score adds an epic sense of liveliness to the film, especially in the action scenes (more on that later). The score sounds good with the film, or by itself, which really makes for a good soundtrack. Now, the action scenes were directed beautifully, and were very clean without an over abundance of cuts, especially the end fight between Spiderman and the Green Goblin. All of the impossible jumps that Spiderman makes, or when he swings from structure to structure look amazing, and this is all thanks to Raimi and his abilities with the camera. He can make a talking scene look nice, or he can make an action scene look nice, which is a great quality for a director to have. The best thing about this film is easily the vulnerability of our hero, Spiderman. Throughout the entire movie, Spiderman gets the crap beaten out of him, both physically and mentally. His thoughts are attacked, his body is attacked, his loved ones are attacked, and this is what makes the Green Goblin a great villain. He knows all of Spiderman's weaknesses, and he strikes them right where he should. This is where the film shines most, when the hero gets his butt kicked. This is because when the hero finally rises up to overcome the seemingly impossible hurdle, it makes the audience feel all that much better about his victory. This is common in all great films that contain a "hero", such as every film in the Dark Knight trilogy, Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), and even movies such as Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). Now, the only complaint I had, and this is very nitpicky, is the suit of the Green Goblin. There's no way to let it down easily, he looks like a Power Ranger. Although the suit doesn't look bad, they should've gone with something a bit more realistic, and not just completely comical. If they would've done this, he wouldn't have looked like a Power Ranger, and he possibly would've looked as cool as he actually was. Overall, Spiderman is an amazing superhero movie, and an amazing movie, and one of the best origin stories put to film. I recommend Spiderman to anyone and everyone; it's worth your time.
5.0~entertaining but corny KritterJ Sign in Permalink I am reading these other reviews and so many people are calling this movie amazing. I have to say that it was entertaining. I do not feel like I wasted my money, and I cheered on Spidey/Peter with the rest of the audience. But the Green Goblin was REALLY corny. Willem Defoe is a great actor, but what could he do with those terribly scenes talking to the mask etc.? The best part of the movie was Peter's self-discovery of his new abilities. The basic good vs. evil part of the plot flopped in my book. I haven't been to a movie in a long time where I actually rolled my eyes and laughed at how stupid some things were, especially dialogue. Laughing at a "serious" line is not a good thing. I will go see the obviously-on-its-way sequel, but probably not on the first weekend. Does this replace the classic Superman? I don't think so. Does this rate against other great movies like Crouching Tiger (like another reviewer suggested)? You HAVE to be kidding! I was, however, intrigued by the preview for The Hulk directed by Ang Lee. Interesting...
10.0~Exceeded my hopes kabloo20 Sign in Permalink I had high hopes because of Tobey's involvement, but the film far exceeded them. The film is never slow, the cast is brilliant and Sam Raimi has done the impossible, made a comic book film appeal to those of us who, in general, deeply dislike comic books. This will get my repeat business where "Clones" will certainly not.
10.0~Greatest Movie Ever (****CONTAINS SPOILERS****) BCMTthompson Sign in Permalink Spiderman is truely the greatest movie I have ever seen. The visual effects are some of the most amazing that I have ever seen. I must admit that I had my doubts about Tobey Maguire as Spiderman, but he came through, big time. The fact that the movie spent so much time of the Mary Jane story line did nothing to slow the incredible pace of this movie. The effects at times looked more like an incredible video game than a live-action movie, which only made it even better. I see incredible sequal potentials for this movie. The movie's end with Harry's vow for revenge and MJ's confession of love are only the beginning. There are literally dozens of villains that would make incredible movies. For example: Scorpion, VENOM AND CARNAGE, Vulture, Doctor Octopus, VENOM AND CARNAGE, Kingpin, Electo, Mysterio, VENOM AND CARNAGE. The introduction of Eddie Brock at the Daily Bugle indicates that the film's creator intend to use Venom in one movie, possibly the next one coming out next year. The Venom and Carnage story lines could be used in several movies. I was amazed by Spiderman despite the deviations for the original story line, such as the origin of the spider that bit peter, his first use of his powers, THE WEBBING COMING NATURALLY FROM HIS WRIST rather than being an invention, and the Green Goblin originating before the Hobgoblin. I did like the little phrases that were casually thrown into the conversation (ie "The Amazing Spiderman", "Friendly Neighborhood Spiderman" and "Tiger") Overall: 10 out of 10. Greatest Movie I've Ever Seen.
10.0~The hype is not just hype. Cristofer Seven Sign in Permalink The buzz surrounding this movie you would think it was the second coming, but it is a solid film. This film was not lacking in any way. I have heard that Willem Dafoe was a bit over the top with the green goblin, but I am of the opinion that he portrayed the character as he is in the comic. The green goblin was a wild villain. The character was over the top. I do have one complaint. The soundtrack... it sounded like the Batman score in its tone and pacing. The soundtrack would have fit better in a movie about the Dark Knight not Spiderman. This is a great film.
9.0~Good things come together. Aslan-6 Sign in Permalink Who would have thought that one of the most mainstream comic books of all time would find it's success in the hands of Hollywood outsiders. This is not to say that Director Raimi and stars Durst and McGuire are new on the scene but lets just say they are far from obvious choices. What is remarkable about these three talented people is how their signature direction/performance pieces enhance this well known story so well. Sam: His ability to string together rapid camera movements created an action scene flow absent from film sense The Matrix. Signature touches like Bruce Cambell's mockery as the birth of the Spider-Man name, Dafoe's scenes with himself in the mirror, and an ability to make every person in the theater want to be in that hero's shoes. (Think Ash kicking the dead with the shotgun/chainsaw combo) Tobey: The ultimate everyman, people don't act like actors, they act like Tobey. The look on his face after knocking Flash (the bully) across the hall was in my opinion one of the greatest expressions in recent film history. His chemistry with not only Durst but his aunt and Dafoe made the film as intersting when Parker was on screen as when Spidey was swinging about. Kirsten: She is the ultimate girl next door. She gave a predictable character (that in another production would have gone to a WB star) human depth. We don't like MJ because she is that gorgeous girl Spider-Man saves, we like her because of her compassion and we know she is Parker's soul-mate. In closing I would like to add that I know sequels are coming and that makes me nervous, this one will be hard to top.
8.0~Pure Fun! ilovedolby Sign in Permalink Fun super-hero flick that is good, clean entertainment for the whole family. This film will turn Tobey Maguire into a superstar. And with its huge opening weekend sales at the U.S. box-office of $114 million, there are sure to be sequels. Hopefully, director Sam Raimi can bring us more thrilling, summer entertainment. ***
8.0~Great Popcorn Flick tbatch Sign in Permalink For the comic book genre, this one probably had the best cast, best story and best acting. It also boasts probably the best computer generated effects to date, although some shots are obviously borrowed. Some of the effects appear to be intentionally cartoon-ish which I thought gave some of the action sequences a really cool and original look. Get ready for the sequel, they spent a lot of time in the movie developing characters and setting it up and you are left with a bit of a cliff-hanger. Overall: Spiderman is a cool movie that really should be seen in the theater.
3.0~Great CG, Good Acting, Bad Script sjschen Sign in Permalink This set of comments might be spoilerish, but I think it lacks enough detail to make it so. Besides, I think most people go into this movies aleady knowing what to expect. Spoiler? Not too possible I applaud the fine work of the actors and actresses, not to mention the absolutely stunning computer graphics. However, what the heck were the script and story people doing?? I personally find the lines and plots of this movie cliche-ish and predictable. Especially with that whole inflated power/responsibility spiele and the ultimately the "girl falls helplessly in love with main character" business. Yes, she hints that she likes him throughout the movie (once or twice I think). She has something mainly for spiderman but all of a sudden, she felt that Peter was the one, and she could not live her life without him. Peter with his whole "power/resposibility" business had to squash her to a billion bits, look and walk (nose to the sky) towards to distance and had to mutter in his head "WITH POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY" (ugh). This is something I expected to see in an afternoon soap opera or a sappy B movie. This is just a tiny bit of the beef I have with the script and story of this movie. But perhaps people like this movie, because of the sappy script, or maybe because of the whole "don't mess with New York theme". I don't know, the entire theater audience was cracking jokes at it all the while(and rightly so I think), which was why I am so surprised that I got such high ratings!!!! Anyways, to each their own.
1.0~I didn't like it, but it seems I'm the only one... polarsteam Sign in Permalink People seem to really like this film; I'm not sure why. I thought that it started well -- the effects were cool and it was entertaining. However, everything that the film built up to was completely and utterly destroyed in the last minute, leaving two friends and I horribly confused and wondering if the theater had received the wrong reel. If you see it, do yourself a favor and walk out when it cuts to a funeral scene; just make your own ending up, it'll be better than the trash actually put into the film. 1/10.
8.0~Deserving but inferior blockbuster Elswet Sign in Permalink I have to say for a mainstream blockbuster this was really quite good. I usually try to avoid mainstream successes, but as a fan of Spiderman since early childhood, I simply had to go see this production. I figured that I would end up dogging it, but in fact, I found it to be a very effective adaptation of Stan Lee's work. The main (and only real) problem with this movie was the treatment of the villain, the Green Goblin. The make up effects, costume, and CGI were not what I call good. (For a perfect example of CGI at its best, check out the water-horses Arwen calls to save Frodo in "Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring.") The action sequences of this work are really rather muddled and messy. The CGI is obvious and was not the effects work of art 2 Oscar nominations (one for best special effects) would indicate. Other than the arch-villain's being this campy old piece of crap (about as bad, but not quite, as the Scorpion King in "Mummy Returns"), the rest of the movie was very good. But does that element alone ruin the feature? In some unimportant way, yes, as by far, it did not live up to its potential. But in the major way, no. The performances were realistic, believable, and solid; the story was faithful to the original comic book line first written by Stan Lee; and the sets and props were all meticulously detailed and crafted. All in all, still a very good production. The action elements were well placed (if somewhat sloppy), the comedic factors were delivered properly and timed perfectly, and the dramatic methodologies were carefully directed and enacted. The plot of this story was creatively written, and executed with a fondness, inspired by a thorough character development indicative of a director who loves this comic book legend. It rates an 8.0/10 from... the Fiend :.
9.0~Overall Excellent. But... vbasic Sign in Permalink Wow!! This was a fairly faithful to the book movie of Spider-man and I loved it. It was a fast-paced, action-packed and fun movie. Most important, the kids loved it. SPOILER ALERT Having said all that, there was some things that should have been cut to add to the pace and be more true to the comic: Cut 1) Ben saying he was laid off and needed a job. There was no mention of that in the comic, and besides a 68 year-old man and his wife are getting a nice SS check plus his small pension, with mortgage paid off. So it didn't make sense and dragged the pace. -cut that- Cut 2) Having Mary Jane as his next door neighbor and the mentioning of the drunk dad. It wasn't so in the comic. They usually got together about town. That dragged the pace and made her less chic as she was in the comic. -cut that- Cut 3) At the end at Osbornes funeral, Peter's talk with Mary Jane was too somber. Mary Jane was always more upbeat and flip with the gab. -cut that and replace it with them having a lighter conversation in town. Now listing the things I would have cut, here are things I would add. Scene 1 to add) In the comic book origin, when Peter headed home after been bit by the spider, he staggered out in the street and was almost hit by a car. As he leapt out the way, his body flew into a building and he stuck to the wall. That would have been a more impactful scene instead of him 'gradually' noticing his powers. Scene 2 to add) In the movie, Peter seemed more confused and befuddled by the abuse he was taking from the other teens. But in the book he was downright ANGRY!! Notice what he says in the very first appearance of Spider-Man when they make fun of him. "Some day I'll show them. Some day they'll be sorry! Sorry that they laughed at me!" Scene 3 to add) I would have liked to see an intermediate scene where he shows HOW he would be a crime-fighter. It seems like after the capture of Ben's killer, he jumps right into it. I would have like it to be more gradual, like maybe some petty crimes of loud kids on the bus or subway messing with the passengers, while he was in his regular clothes. Scene 4 to add) Banter during the fights. Spidey did it all all time and it was funny. So I missed that. But aside from that, I was happy with the film and felt that Raimi gave us a faithful adaptation.
8.0~Sam Raimi at his best baodawao Sign in Permalink Spider-man is an adaption by the comic-book series by Stan Lee. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco and Willem Dafoe stars in this magnificent movie by Sam Raimi. The movie is about a young student named Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) who is a very shy, awkward person and not very lucky with the girls. One day when the class is on a school expedition, Peter gets bitten by a mutated spider. The morning after Peter wakes up with having superhuman strength, fast reflexes, etc. Peter soon begin using his powers to make money, but when his uncle gets killed by a criminal, Peter then swears to kill criminals as spider-man. At the same time a scientist named Norman Osbourn (Willem Dafoe)develops super-strength after he gets exposure by experimental nerve gas. Norman becomes spider-man's biggest enemy Green Goblin. The movie is directed well by Sam Raimi (Evil dead 1 and 2). The script is also very well written by David Koepp (Secret window, Jurassic park). The movie features some very good action and funny sequences. It also have some very good CGI-effects. I recommend this movie for all action fans.
9.0~Childhood Memories Forever Golden. Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187 Sign in Permalink Spiderman resurrected the superhero movie genre that was in a perpetual flunk since Batman & Robin sucked the life out of it; thanks to Spidey and the X-Men MARVEL's superheroes reanimated the supposedly doomed genre from beyond the grave and it's now back in full-swing. And thankfully Batman and Spiderman now live a peaceful and successful co-existence in the form of movies like The Dark Knight Trilogy, The LEGO Batman Movie, Justice League, Spiderman: Homecoming and Avengers Infinity War. So how does this movie from 2002 hold up? Very well I dare say. I remember seeing Spiderman at the cinema like it was yesterday; okay maybe not quite as literal as that but I remember the WOW of it like it just happened. Seeing my equal favourite superhero of all time in a movie at long last was a once-in-a-lifetime event! The suit was amazing, the music was amazing and so was the action; though the visual CG-effects haven't aged very well. However the fighting was visceral just like the choreography in the sequences, and all these extremes actually respected Spiderman's character. The film was funny, exciting and emotional at times. It's pretty much a satisfying full-package of a superhero movie. Spiderman is still my favourite Marvel superhero and this film compliments everything that makes the character memorable and distinct from the rest of the 'super-crowd'.
8.0~Such a fun film jake-law123 Sign in Permalink I love these films! Even though they're not the most honoring to the comics, they're still fun, colorful, and unique to watch. Even if you don't read the comics, the film gives you enough to recognize the main parts of the comics, such as the characters, the settings, and of course, the villain. Tobey Maguire plays a miraculous Peter Parker and Spider-man. He's such a nerd, which makes you feel all the more happy for him when he's kicking the ass of every crook on the street. The build up for gaining his powers, the death of Uncle Ben, and the birth of Spider-man is done incredibly well. The villain is the Green Goblin, played by Willem Dafoe, who is also built up real well. The relationship is actually with Mary Jane Watson instead of Gwen Stacy, like the comics have it. I'm not going to lie, i'm not the biggest fan of Mary Jane, all she seems to do is get in trouble and have to be saved, not really Kirsten Dunst's fault, that's just what Sam Raimi wanted. She herself doesn't do a bad job, but she sure does scream a lot. You still care a lot about her, since Peter loves her so much. The film is very colorful and adventurous, the costume is very traditional, but looks so nice. The cinematography is smooth, and swinging around with Spider-man is so fun because you just feel like it's you swinging from building to building. The music by Danny Elfman is, what I consider to be a classic music score. The effects are standard early 21st century CGI, which isn't bad, but some scenes are painfully obvious that they're CGI. Either way I have much respect for this film. It's a film before it's a comic book, therefore it decides it doesn't need to follow the comics so closely to be successful. If you're a hardcore fan of the comics, then this might not be your cup of tea, but if you're looking for a solid comic book action film, then look no further, because this is one of the best comic book films of all time.
10.0~Great stuff! *No spoilers* Neil_MacLeod Sign in Permalink I was surprised they gave Raimi this movie but he did not disappoint with a faithful (mostly) to the comic adaptation. Yes the Green Goblin does look like a Transformer but really, in the comic he wore tights so I will take the 2002 live action version as opposed to that. Spider man 2 looks even better, with Raimi bringing his horror skills to play in his version of Doc Ock.
9.0~One of the better comic movies ron_72180 Sign in Permalink I have to admit I was scared going into this movie. Spider-Man is my favorite comic characters and knowing all the legal hell it went through I didnt want to be disappointed. I wasn't. This movie stayed true to the story with only a few minor changes here and there. The acting was very solid, the scenery was great and the Spider-Man costume wasnt really altered from the comic....unfortunately the Green Goblin's was. I was hoping there wouldnt be a cheesy approach to this movie like the last few Batman's, but this was one of the better comic movies. To me the best were the original Tim Burton Batman and X-Men. The effects were okay...it seemed like they got better at the end. They didnt seem as fake as in other points in the movie. Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin is the definite winner in this movie. He is so dead on and sadistic that he stole the show. After the success of X-Men and Spider-Man you can see that all the comic books will have movies soon. Daredevil is out, Hulk is coming soon, X2, which so far has looked great, is out next month, The Punisher will begin shooting soon, Ghost Rider and a bunch of others. Hopefully the coming Spidey sequel will still remain tight and true. Sam Raimi did an incredible job on this movie and cannot wait for the sequel. He has an incredible artistic eye and imagination. Im glad he finally got some true recognition.
7.0~Great! ammarjamal Sign in Permalink Raimi's spiderman was released into theatres back in 2002, the film is great it had everything that a spiderman fan wants in a film adaption of the character's origin story. Sam Raimi did a good job at directing the film, his directing made me feel like I am spiderman (when spiderman swings the camera often moves) therefore giving the viewer the closest experience he can get from web swinging around new york. Raimi's take on spiderman wasn't dark it wasn't too comedic either, the film seemed to have the perfect blend of action, drama and comedy. Spiderman had a lot of humorous scenes, which were very interesting especially like when peter says "shazam" while trying to use the web or when he catches the food with MJ's tray, the fight scenes were excellent, I mean it's spiderman vs the green goblin...who wouldn't want to see that, but, the romance between Peter Parker and Mary Jane was way too extreme, I refuse to believe that MJ was Peter's inspiration to become spiderman. In terms of writing the film had a good screenplay, it covered all the traditional elements of a superhero origin story, and added a few things, like the romance between MJ and Peter (which I did not like at all, it ruined the film for me) The acting in spiderman was not bad, Kristen Dunst's performance wasn't as good as expected, it felt like the sense of mystery was missing from MJ's character. Some people complained about how Tobey Maguire didn't look like peter parker, in my opinion he was a great Spiderman, he live up to the role, he was able to portray the high school nerd side of peter parker and the spiderman side, his movements were "spider-like" as well, and his reflexes were great while he was spiderman, unlike Andrew Garfield's take. James Franco was as always...brilliant, and surprisingly William Dafoe made an excellent Green Goblin he had one of the best portrayals in comic book movie villain history! The costumes were great in spiderman, the spiderman suit looked very fresh and modern, when Green Goblin's suit looked bad ass, it was excellent! The Cinematography in spiderman was really good especially when spiderman is swinging around new york. The effects were good too. Overall I give the film a 7/10 it was a well written, well directed film, but the romance between MJ and Peter was way too extreme and ruined the film for me.
10.0~only the 1st batman comes close takatomon Sign in Permalink i've never been into baseball cards or comic books or cartoons much other than bugs bunny. this movie rocks! darkman was not as good as batman despite what the tv ads said. spawn? nah... x-men? eh... mystery men? nice concept. superman? oh no... who framed roger rabbit? pretty good... the shadow? i can't rememember it... dick tracy? yawn... spiderman? is awesome! it has great special effects, solid believable characters, a few laughs, date friendly romantic scenes, and a good tangled web plot right up there with batman for character motivations. of course there were predictable formula cliches a-plenty... (and one overdue break from cliche) but one always knows that they are going to lead somewhere new eventually. i thought the ending started to get forced for a second... but... see for yourself. is it better than batman? action-wise it's no contest thanks to spiderman's 3D animation. (an unfair advantage) it's no doubt that they are both two of the finest comic book adaptions ever in my novice opinion. i'm going to see it again for the little details. it's a thoroughly enjoyable film and i'm very fussy. my only complaint would be that some of the action sequences are too quick and that the action is mostly brief. to be fair there are plenty of different situations that happen. it's a style thing i guess. action... drama... action... comedy... action... drama... and so on. i give it a 10 for high "now there's something you don't see every day... wait.... there's something you do" value. the one swear word i remember hearing was of the tv sitcom variety and was NEEDED for the scene. the violence level was fairly low too by action movie standards. back to basics adventure? i thought all superheroes (and villians) needed to wear trenchcoats and kill many people in gory slow motion scenes these days. ;-) now, what will star wars be like? it will have serious competition from spiderman a week or so from now. then there's lord of the rings and star trek ahead soon. i think computer animation is here to stay. call it a hunch.
1.0~Amazingly boring gothedhel Sign in Permalink I went to see Spiderman hoping that the critics were right and it was not another Batman Forever. But, as usual, critics were wrong. The acting is bad, and so are the dialogues -whenever Parker talks to M.J. longer than ten seconds it becomes irritant. Special effects are not specially bad, but didn't shock me. Spiderman looked very fake during some scenes -mainly action scenes-, though. Action scenes are just fine, but unspectacular. The Green Goblin looks like if he stole some Power Ranger suit, and sometimes he was also too clownish. Peter Parker doesn't make any joke while fighting with the Green Goblin, what is a shame, since it was part of his personality in the comic-book. Yeah, it beats Batman and Robin, but that's not saying much. After watching Spiderman, I must say that Attack of the Clones was far better. In fact, it was funny, since all that was supposed to be better done in Spiderman was ridiculously bad. I left the cinema very disappointed.
10.0~The best movie with the best and cutest actor. w1cht3l Sign in Permalink I watched it on 8/5, Spider Man is being shown in HK since 3/5. I enjoy the whole period. I looked the name, "Tobey Maguire". It's really a special star, I thought, and now it proved that he is. He is the ccutest spider-man. As cute as Inspector Gadget...Matthew Broderick. But Matthew couldn't play Spider-man...or, a fat spider. But I disliked Mary Jane, becuase she's too flirt. I think, the people should find another girl to be Mary Jane. Mary Jane Watson is Mary Jane's name in the film, but I've checked the cartoon, Spider Man, Mary's real name is MJ Fernandiez. Something like that. Spider-man is Peter Parker, of coz! "MJ is the strongest, and also the weakest." "Who am I? you really wish to know?" "If they said that I'm as normal as you, they are lying you." "As Uncle Ben had spoken, when you hold more power, you will have more responsibility." "Who am I? I'm spider-man!" "Before the spider bites me, I'm really a normal person. But now I'm holding a special power." "Why? I love MJ, but whom I love will never like me?" "Yeah, Uncle Ben! As you are not my father, please don't try to be him! It's impossible that you are my father!" "MJ is as plain/tame as the neighbouring girl. She's a holy angel"
7.0~The best and worst Hollywood has to offer Anne_Sharp Sign in Permalink One one hand this film sets the standard for what a Hollywood superhero movie should be. Instead of camping it up or trying to take the story to another level that throws away the fundamental ingenuous appeal of the original comic (which is what happened with both the television and film incarnations of "Batman") it is a true live action comic book, presenting its juvenile, melodramatic subject matter with sincerity and a straightforward graphic flair that without being at all obvious about it provides a genuine analog to the classic Marvel style. On the other hand, the fact that it is nothing more than another extremely costly Hollywood comic book come to life makes it infuriating viewing for anyone watching with a brain not on idle. Seldom has a contemporary film dared to present such a blatantly retro-Hollywood misogynist worldview, with its musclebound, power-obsessed male protagonists demonstrating only the most primitive interests in the only two female characters, a deferential old lady (ROSEMARY HARRIS???? isn't this a little like casting Laurence Olivier as Grandpa Walton?) who mainly exists to serve food and a young woman (Kirsten Dunst, augmented breasts jutting awkwardly from anorectic ribcage) whose purpose is to totter on high heels between encounters with males bent on raping/murdering/courting/protecting her. Watching pretty Toby Macguire ecstatically shooting through the air on threads of spermlike "silk" and stolidly rejecting the woman he "loves" because he has more important things to do than actually stick around and have a relationship with her--like zipping around in the night chasing other muscular fellows in tight suits with his sperm-thrower--tells you all you need to know about subtext here. Yeah, just keep telling yourself, it's only a movie.
1.0~Could have been better projectorlover Sign in Permalink I can understand why so many people like this film. We need heroes at the moment. But does that make the movie work. No. I really didn't think too much of this movie. It missed the edge that made Batman original and the style that made X men memorable. Lines like "I'm your friendly neighbourhood Spiderman" really sucked. I don't care if he said that in the comic. Music score was not Elfman's usual standards and Kirsten Dunst whilst beautiful, was only good for screaming. Only Tobey Maguire was memorable and some of the effects. That green goblin outfit was sooo bad. Worst costume since the guyver movie. It was too teeny, too lame and too long. Here's hoping X men 2 or the Hulk (now that looks cool) will be better. 5/10
1.0~the worst version ever... evision Sign in Permalink what a waste of money.. childish as hell, even insolt for children mind. the plot goes around this geek sensitive boy that everyone hates(include me) that change into this stupid baby butty cockroach-man. this plot is sticky with this stupid kid relation ship with his neigbour, that is hunting the movie to the lowest roman ever made. even the fight scenes are lame ,and the effects are a cheep attempt to reply the genius work in the matrix. i would write much more, but its painful to relive this awofle movie again. ill just say that its worst movie i saw in months now, and i see alot!! and it RUINED spiderman for me forever. my vote in 1 word: embaracing BEWARE!!
9.0~Raimi immortalizes Spider-Man... giancarlorocks Sign in Permalink The transcendence of a world renowned super hero into the immortalization of a silver screen icon is a difficult task. Yet Sam Raimi's Spider-Man' is a cinematic piece of uber-Popcorn filmmaking that is a pure treat to experience. Not to watch, but to experience. Viewers will familiarize themselves with the delicate xenophobic genius of Norman Osborn and the fragile torrid innocence of a young Peter Parker destined for infamy. Sam Raimi directs a stylized and vast piece that will hold true to Spidey fans worldwide. A mediocre script by David Koepp is improved upon by the visceral imprint Director Sam Raimi creates upon his key sequences. An astonishing trait lifted from the film is an incredibly surprising pervasive sense of dualistic symbolism. This profound characteristic seeps through the film. Before we go into detail, one can assume that I really enjoyed the film. That is a fact. Yet many will disagree with me due to the film's modest approach to such a beloved icon. And yet that is where I find the brilliance within the film. Raimi sculpts a fun piece of film that can not be simply brushed off as a brainless, summer piece of moviemaking. It is a certainty that the Summer Movie Season has officially commenced. It is a strong possibility that films to come will be mundane and recycled, yet Spider-Man' leaves its' mark as a new kind of Superhero film that many will attempt to imitate, yet will not succeed. Raimi's simplistic approach to such a huge undertaking must be admired because it works. Special effects are an added bonus to this intricately weaved film that does not rely on the special effects to tell a story, but instead relies in the development of these inter-related personas. Tim Burtom was the first to immortalize an icon of comic books with his gothic and darkly entertaining 1989 feature Batman'. In Burton's film, our opening sequence introduces us to this mythical being that has already made a name for him through the rumblings of crooks in the Gotham streets. In this film, Raimi takes a step back and gives us a concise and detailed account into the origin of this masked legend who is cursed with a powerful gift. Upon anticipation for the film's release, I questioned how Raimi would sustain the interest of the audience when Peter Parker was not Spider-Man. Could Raimi show us Parker going from zero to hero in an entertaining and cohesive fashion? Those worries were quickly disregarded as the opening credits rolled and Danny Elfman's pounding score tricked its' way through the digital sound. This film paces itself beautifully and provides a healthy balance between the hero and the man behind the hero. We come to sympathize with this young man as he struggles to counter the unexpected exuding powers he must come to terms with after a genetically enhanced spider bites him on a school trip. WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY' is a line frequently uttered in the film. That can also be applied to Raimi's demeanour as a filmmaker who knows will be single-handedly in charge of either creating a profitable studio franchise or tarnishing the immortality of a boyhood icon. The power Raimi has to create a great film is highly visible on screen as he amalgamates all great levels of cinema to bring us a thoroughly enjoyable film. Raimi incorporates sparkling visual imagery with a surprisingly deep character enhancement of all our main characters. Mary Jane Watson is played with sexual zest by Kirsten Dunst who will be catapulted to stardom with this role. James Dean look-alike, James Franco; displays his inner anger at one of the film's final cataclysmic scenes as he proves he isn't just a pretty face. As for Tobey Maguire, his hypnotic blue eyes are enough at stating a stellar casting choice for our Peter Parker. While emitting anxiety and joyous boyhoodness while discovering his newly found powers, we can sympathize with a dorky high school nerd who is suddenly pounding his bullies and web slinging his way through the streets of New York. Yet the film's greatest surprise is a scene stealing villain reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's Joker role in Burton's Batman'. Dafoe incarnates a new breed of evil as a schizophrenic scientist who evolves into the Green Goblin. Subtle humour and dark ferocity elicit a thorough assessment from this larger than life villain who terrorizes and entices us with his demonic ways. Earlier I mentioned a duality of sorts between these two characters, those who have seen the film will understand this next analogy playing back the Thanksgiving scene in their mind. We all know Parker and Osborn are bitter enemies under the masks yet seem to have a kind relationship as their altar-egos. Yet upon the film's climax in an abandoned cemetery we can see the fate these two characters await. The duality of these two characters is unmistakably immense as we are guided through covert symbolism suggesting a grander scheme of destiny for these two characters. In a nutshell, these two characters are much more thought provoking than expected resulting in a solid two hours of masterful entertainment that is led by the characters and not the action. A solid example of this the duality of Osborn can be viewed as he encounters his innate evil in The Green Goblin. What I call the Mirror' scene displays this perfectly as Osborn falls prey to his own evil. Without giving too much away, Raimi is on the ball as he delivers a fun, entertaining and satisfying Spider-Man' film that will have them in droves at your multiplex. On a final note, make sure to stick around for the end credits as true Spidey Fans get a nostalgic treat during the final moments. Giancarlo's Rating: ***
6.0~Good 1st half then falls apart jangomac72 Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi brings Marvel's flagship character to the screen after years of development hell and legal wrangles over film rights. Tobey Maguire stars as nerdy high school student Peter Parker who is bitten by a genetically altered spider and develops the proportionate abilities of a spider. After misusing his newly-given powers which indirectly causes the death of his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), he becomes the heroic Spider-Man and learns that "with great power comes great responsibility". Raimi's smash hit blockbuster starts off brilliantly with its introductions to our characters with the cast ably filling out their roles, Maguire does a great job of conveying the right amount of awkwardness as Peter, Robertson and Rosemary Harris are a joy to watch as Uncle Ben and Aunt May and Willem Dafoe is well cast as industrialist Norman Osborn, the soon to be Green Goblin. Kirsten Dunst does an OK job in the role of Mary Jane Watson but the character, as written in the film, is a far cry from the cocky confident party goer from the comics and suffers because of that. There's a deftness of touch to the opening hour with just the right amount of faithfulness to the comic book whilst updating certain aspects from the comic that would come across as awkward on screen (radioactive spiders and organic webshooters for example) In fact the film very much follows the first Superman film in its tone and pace with the origins of Spider-Man making up the majority of that first hour (as they did with Superman The Movie) Unfortunately once Spider-Man makes his debut in the film it all starts to fall apart and the film suddenly runs out of steam. And the main fault lies with the protagonist, the Green Goblin, whose storyline grinds to a halt once the subplot regarding the battle for control of his company is concluded. There's little reason for the Goblin to do what he does in the film bar the fact that he's angry that Spider-Man tried to stop his attack at Times Square (a very flat action sequence that is the one of the big set pieces of the film) His so-called offer to join forces with Spider-Man makes little sense and is one of the worst scenes in the film as you have two masked figures having a conversation on an obvious studio set that comes across as a scene from a toy commercial. And that scene highlights the problem with the Green Goblin in this film. You don't hire an actor as good and as expressive as Willem Dafoe only to then cover him up completely in, what can only be described as, a Power Ranger suit so you can't see the performance. Just compare any scene where he's dressed as the Goblin to the scene where he talks to his alter ego in the mirror and you can see that prosthetic make up was the way to go with the design of the character. It's a huge mistake that robs most of the second half of the film of its drama as there's little plot bar the Goblin then going on a rampage against Spider-Man and his friends and family. The final battle amongst the ruins of an old building also has to be one of the most violent sequences I've seen in a family oriented film and is another huge shift of tone that just feels wrong when the first half of the film was so much fun. The film only regains any sense of wonder in its closing moments when we follow Spider-Man swinging through the New York skyline and it's a real shame that just as the film begins to soar again, it ends. A definite film of two halves and a great, missed opportunity to be a fantastic start to Spidey's cinematic adventures. You know you're in trouble when one of the best parts of the film is hearing the 60's Spider-Man Cartoon theme tune at the end of the closing credits 6/10
10.0~One of the Greatest Movies of this year Jawa11182 Sign in Permalink Spiderman is One of the Greatest Movies of this year. After the movie I was in awe. There were special effects but not that much that really kills the movie, but there were enough. I like the way that the writer (David Koepp)made the story by putting some old Spiderman with some new Spiderman. The acting was great and all the actors really looked like the characters in Spiderman. This movie deserves a 10 because it was just that good. Will there be another one, one could only hope so. I can't wait for the DVD to come out (which will definitely not be soon).
10.0~one big spin!!! matthewke20 Sign in Permalink this movie was great! i was surprised of tobey..he was very awesome..directer made a good choice of choosing spiderman, the movie was one big spin! i can't wait for spiderman 2! i'll be there for sure! it was great! i just have to say GREAT alot cuz the movie to me...it was speechless...
8.0~Pretty Good MTree Sign in Permalink As usual, no over-hyped film can meet my expectations, but the more I think about "Spider-Man", the better I think it is. First, the good points: The acting is good, the story is strong and the effects are great(though at first they seem a little fake). Once Spidey and the Green Goblin started fighting I was in heaven. The film also makes some good changes from the comic, like Pete not making the webshooters, and the pivotal scene with Uncle Ben is done more believably. Now the bad points: Too much build-up. The film is more than half over before we see a fully-costumed Spider-Man. It seems like he's only in the last 45 minutes or so. Unfortunately, that's when the film really kicks into high gear, and it's too little too late. I enjoy a good story too, but like 1989's "Batman" we see too little of the hero. I hope the sequel will make up for it. If the film had another half hour or so of Spidey in action, it would have been great. Overall, a good but not great comic adaptation. Better than Batman or the X-Men, but not as good as Superman. 8 out of 10.
1.0~Absolute Rubbish smackajacka Sign in Permalink What is it with Hollywood these days? They seem to be making boring films or resurrecting old comic book heroes etc. What happened to the days when we had Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sly Stallone and Bruce Willis? Now they were good actors and starred in good films. These days, all Hollywood seem to do is put a bunch of 'famous' people (who are rubbish) like Julia Roberts or Brad Pitt into films and waste a few billion dollars investing in special effects and it seems that the movie is a hit. Spiderman is no exception. It is a ridiculously boring film, the main actor Toby Macguire should not have been given the part and the thing that makes it bad is the fact that it uses about 1 billion special effects every second! When will directors ever learn? It doesnt make it look any good..it just makes it look a whole lot worse and MUCH less realistic. Films like Terminator 2 were a hit success not just because it used groundbreaking digital effects, but it didnt swamp the whole film with them. This is what made it, (and still now after 11 years) so realistic and pleasing to watch. Spiderman is a waste of time and money..why do directors seem to think that just because they waste all their money on effects, that the film will be a hit? Well, the only reason why it did well in the USA was because Spiderman had been a legend for 100 years and people waited for the movie to come out..that is the ONLY reason why. In the rest of the world, (UK being a main example), it got bad reviews and i just can't wait until this 'spiderman fever'(that's targeted for 10 year olds and the director being stupid enough to make it so violent it is rated 12) goes away. Don't waste your money on this trash. Be sensible. See something else.
10.0~All the Wonderful Wall-Crawling Action You've come to Expect! lucas-42 Sign in Permalink This movie I have now seen twice. Rarely, if ever, does a movie become more than just a movie. Seldom do I walk out of the theater, smiling, with only one other thought on my mind.. "I wanna do that again!" Yup, this movie is definitely that. I'll be honest to you all. The movie is not PERFECT, but it IS perfectly entertaining. You'll see what I mean after you've sat through this flick. True, some of the CGI special-fx are not as realistic as you would expect from a film given a budget over $100,000,000. But, they are good enough to convincingly tell a really good story. No, scratch that last remark. A really GREAT story! Spider-Man is one of those movies that you'll remember long after you've taken those final steps out of the local theater. I found it funny at times, heartwarming at others, and action-packed when it needed to be. Tobey is the perfect choice for Peter Parker/Spiderman because, well, he just is. He convinces us that he's an outcasted dork who has his eyes sat upon the seemingly un-reachable MJ, who suddenly is overwhelmed with new powers and responsiblities. He does a good job of playing Spidey. From the sharp-wit to the honest nature of Peter Parker. He pulls it off nicely. William Dafoe does one of the most convincing Jekyll/Hyde scenes you may ever see in your life. He's talking to his alter-personality, the Green Goblin, in a mirror.. switching back and forth between Norman Osborn and 'ol Gobbie. It's shocking how much scarier Mr. Dafoe can look WITHOUT the Goblin mask. In fact, I think he could have pulled of the Goblin with just a little bit of green makeup. Dafoe IS that good in this movie. There are some moments where Gobbie's gonna make you laugh, trust me. They're hilarious. The movie's story is really great, and it WILL entertain you. For those who have a problem with the oragnic web-shooting spidey, no need to worry. It's hardly even noticeable in the film. It really isn't a big deal. I did, however, have one complaint. I really wish the Goblin mask would have had the ability to move the Goblin's mouth. It just felt a little stupid looking at that big gaping hole in close-up shots. From a distance (i.e. when flying) it doesn't look so bad though. Stick around during the credits, you'll get to hear a special surprise!!
8.0~An Amusing tale. Good special effects. gordymc Sign in Permalink Liked the effects. Looked natural in the role. An entertaining Evening. Just as I remembered the comic stripe. Will probably see it again with other friends to introduce them to the movie or join them if they're looking to see it with someone.
10.0~Iconic, Electrifying, Classy, Vibrant, and Emotionally Stimulating, Spider-Man Represents the Gold Standard in Superhero Blockbusters jaredpahl Sign in Permalink The world of movie superheroes began with Superman, thrived with Batman, and reached its ultimate apex with Spider-Man. 2002's biggest movie event combines the slam bang roller coaster rush of Batman with the heart, sweetness, and aw-shucks sincerity of DC's other titan, into a comic book adaptation that is as close to perfect as any will ever come. A joyous blast of post-9/11 American verve, crafted with class and a keen eye for storytelling, Sam Raimi's 2002 mega-hit is a once-in-a-lifetime, generation defining summer blockbuster, and in the eyes of this Generation Spider-Man-er, it's still the gold standard in superhero cinema. Spider-Man takes most of its cues from 1978's Superman: The Movie. Peter Parker's journey from unassuming geek to high-flying hero mimics the Man of Steel's in story and tone. The colorful comic spirit of Richard Donner's gleefully exciting original is all here, just Marvel-fied. Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp approach Spider-Man's origin with reverence for Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original story. Koepp's script hits all the beats you'd expect (Spider bite, wrestling match, great power, and all that), but it also includes, unexpectedly, an intelligent, eloquent emotional foundation. Raimi and Koepp understand who Peter Parker is, and how his transformation into Spider-Man can metaphorically parallel his development as a character. In being confronted by new and strange spider powers, Peter is also confronted by the responsibilities of manhood. Koepp takes Stan Lee's best idea (That Peter Parker should grapple equally between supervillains and everyday problems), and pushes it to its logical max. Peter's infatuation with girl-next-door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is given equal importance to his struggle with Norman Osborne's manic alter ego, the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). The result is pretty well timeless. The quintessential Spider-Man story. A coming of age tale that gracefully weaves together every important aspect of the wall-crawler's mythos into a grand concoction of pure Spider-Man. Enhancing the story is one of the great casting jobs in motion picture history. First and foremost is Tobey Maguire, who was a revelation as Peter Parker/ Spider-Man. Like Christopher Reeve before him, Maguire completely defines the role. His Parker is a good kid; shy, dorky, and believably square. He radiates with innocence and later, teenage anxiety. As Spider-Man, he's delightfully charismatic. Lively, but never annoyingly brash in the way other Spideys have been. In the costume or not, every subsequent Spidey will live in his shadow. Maguire's casting was a stroke of genius, but it was no anomaly. Kirsten Dunst is a luminous MJ, and she and Peter's romance sparkles with charm. Willem Dafoe relishes his Green Goblin role, with a voice and presence that burn with comic book intensity. And the perfection doesn't stop there. The colorful supporting cast is just plain superb, with a legendary turn from J.K. Simmons as the hard-nosed newspaper man, J. Jonah Jameson, and two measured, twinkle-in-their-eyes performances by Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt May. But Spider-Man belongs to Sam Raimi. A Spider-Man superfan since childhood, Raimi was destined to bring the web-slinger to life. The offbeat sense of violent fun and jubilant cinematic showmanship that made Evil Dead and Darkman so entertaining is precisely what was needed to bring Spider-Man's New York to dazzling light. And what a creation Raimi's Spider-Verse is! The tone, with a precarious balance of larger-than-life action and textured character moments, never wavers once. Raimi crafts in Spider-Man, a New York where the archetypical comic book mainstays: the cackling villains, the wise-cracking heroes, and the pedestrians who shout to the skies "Look, it's Spider-Man!", fit just as well as the richly drawn human characters. Raimi and the creative team behind the film's production design deserve the highest of praises. There is nothing else that combines style and realism to such astonishing effect. It's as if forty years of comics have been distilled into a real world somewhere alongside our own. Spider-Man is a captivating movie to look at. The action scenes are as fast and fun as the best of Cameron or Spielberg, but Raimi adds his own comic book punch, a kind of visceral razor-sharpness that leaps off the screen. The climactic showdown alone is as brutal, shocking, and frighteningly violent a movie battle as you will ever see. And when Spider-Man swings through the Manhattan skyline, you feel the exhilaration like you're right there with him. Despite a moment or two of spotty CGI from Sony Imageworks, the special effects here are world class too. The digital Spidey moves with a grace and elegance that would have been inconceivable just ten years prior, but digital or not, every time Spider-Man was on screen, I couldn't take my eyes off of it. Spider-Man showcases Sam Raimi at his exuberant best. Every frame of this movie is bursting with life. Whether it's the often gripping action scenes or the carefully crafted soap operatic drama, Spider-Man is an enthusiastic piece of crowd-pleasing entertainment, a passionate celebration of the Spider-Man mythos, and above all, a work of unparalleled quality. Blockbusters, especially superhero movies, with their all but guaranteed profits, can often breed lazy filmmaking. Sam Raimi and company fly in the face of that conceit. The filmmakers have taken the time to really craft this film. Wrapped up in all the soaring spectacle is something real; An enchanting love story, a poignant morality tale about becoming the man you will be for the rest of your life. Spider-Man recalls the kind of stand-up-and-cheer excitement that Hollywood has lost in the post Dark Knight/Avengers world of superhero movies. Raimi doesn't try to transcend the genre. Spider-Man is not "more" than a comic book movie, but through sheer craftsmanship, it is as perfect a comic book movie as can be made. I can't imagine that we will ever see the stars align in such a perfect way again. Spider-Man came together exactly as it should have, with exactly the right people, at exactly the right time for the country. Seeing this movie in theaters was an experience I will never forget, and the film still stands as the standard for what superhero blockbusters can be. 95/100
9.0~WOW jasmanw-1 Sign in Permalink What a great Adaptation from the Comic Book. As a long time fan, I was a little skeptical, but Sam Raimi came through with a stunning looking movie. The Action will blow you out of your chair and the although a little time compression is performed, lives up to the original story as written by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko so long ago. If you have seen it, you have got to. It will blow you away.
5.0~I hate Spider-Man!!!!!!!!!!! EmperorHorde777 Sign in Permalink Yes, I truly despise everybody's precious Spider-Man. Why? Because he's what's known as a vigilante! A slave to himself! He's got powers. So what? He thinks because his beloved Uncle Ben got shot, he's bound to a life of crime-fighting and indescribable misery, but he's not. He just chooses to live like that. He also seems quite determined to keep it that way, given how he never thinks to take his stupid pictures of Spider-Man to another newspaper. Oh no, he must always take them to Jameson, so Mr. Stupid Toothbrush Mustache can tell more lies about him. He never thought to tell Harry the truth about the death of his father. Nope, he stupidly "promised" stupid Norman that he'd never let stupid Harry know the truth. Either he never thought of it, or he wants Harry to think that stupid Spider-Man killed stupid Norman. He wants to stay miserable. He's such a #$*&ing idiot, and he's supposed to be a hero?????? More like an annoying bug if you ask me, much less a comic book icon. He doesn't make me like spiders, he makes me snort. I wish the Green Goblin beat him till he bled. I wish the Green Goblin impaled him with his glider's blades. I wish Spider-Man died! Death to Spider-Man! I hope Doctor Octopus dismembers him and paints the city with his radioactive blood!!!!!! negative three hundred billion gazillion stars of of ten
4.0~They did this superhero so wrong apb216 Sign in Permalink Honestly, I'm not a major superhero/Marvel comics person. But I do enjoy them just as much as the next person, and believe that they should be done correctly and tastefully and to step with the comics of which they were based on. I believe this Spiderman movie does him complete injustice. While the first one was not as terrible, the second and third were appalling. I was a lot younger when they first came out and even then I didn't really enjoy or like them. It wasn't well done, the actors were very boring, and I hear from fans that they slaughtered the original comics. I never understand why the movie industry feels the need to change important things, unless it is to save time or they simply do not have the technology to do it justice. The movies felt very watered down, and Kristen's acting is a bit painful to watch. I actually like her in other movies but this is definitely not one of them. She just doesn't seemed fully committed to it. The new Spiderman movie is so much better, watch that one instead.
9.0~Great movie, and a note to a previous review... Z B Brox Sign in Permalink The movie was good. very, very, good. But my point here is this: To whoever said below that the CGI was laughable, and he looked like a rubber doll.... That was real. With a very few exceptions, the Spider-Man you saw there was actually Tobey Maguire in a harness, it was all blue screens and CGI backgrounds, the actual moving figure was real. If it looked like a rubber doll, it was because of the rubbery costume. Laughable, huh?
8.0~Amazing movie from a comic book mikepwong Sign in Permalink I was afraid that Spider-Man was going to be disappointing like The X-Men movie which I found to be more form than substance and lacking lighter moments. After seeing Spider-Man yesterday, I am glad to say that it was far better than I expected. Except for the corny lines in some scenes and the Green Goblin's armour, the movie is spectacular. I am undecided on the biological web shooters. When I first heard about them, I didn't think it was a good idea, but after seeing it in the movie, the idea works well. Besides the Goblin armour which many viewers will like but I did not and the biological web shooters, Spider-Man follows the comic book very closely. More so than any other comic book brought to the big screen. Fans of the comic book will appreciate Director Sam Raimi's efforts, we should all be happy that he'll be directing the second Spider-Man movie as well. The lead actors Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, and Kirsten Dunst were very good. Dafoe is an excellent choice for the Green Goblin. Maguire and Dunst are not exactly what fans picture for Peter Parker and Mary-Jane Watson but few fans will complain. The actor who plays J. Jonah Jameson looked extremely familiar to me, but I could not figure out who it was, so I had to look it up here on the IMDb. Jameson is played by the actor J.K. Simmons, who plays Vern Schillinger in the prison drama OZ. He is also a recurring character on the Law & Order shows playing Dr. Emil Skoda. Spider-Man is a wonderful light action movie and is a treat to all Spider-Man fans. I rated this movie a strong 8 out of 10.
10.0~A silver-age comic book come to life! Eightiesjunkie Sign in Permalink I know that many people were dissatisfied with Sam Raimi's first two Spider-Man films. I'm sure most of them were expecting something with a dark/harder edge to it, rather than the lighthearted, action-adventure film that was presented. I know because upon seeing the film for the first time, I felt the exact same way. You see, I grew up with the 90's animated series which had a bit of a darker take on the character of Spider-Man. At first I regarded the film as "good" but not "GREAT" or "FANTASTIC" because it wasn't what I was expecting. Now however, after many years, (and two God-awful reboot films!) I find the film to be excellent! I finally understand the director's intention for this film, and I've read a bunch of the original silver-age comics, to which the the film is based on. In my opinion, this film succeeds on all levels! The main plot of the film is based on Spider-Man's origin story (From Amazing Fantasy 15) and the climax of the film is partially based on Amazing Spider-Man #121. a.k.a (The night Gwen Stacey died) Although, some changes were made. The story, characters, and look of the film work extremely well. All of the actors were excellent! They fully understood the core of their characters, and made them come alive. Many people have complained about the silly lines of dialogue, and the corny jokes said by certain characters in the film. I no longer have a problem with this, and here's why: In the original 60's comics, there were silly lines and corny jokes, but that was all part of their charm, and atmosphere. Which is what this movie beautifully re-creates, the charm and atmosphere of the original 60's and 70's Spider-Man comics. I liked this movie back in the summer of '02, but now I LOVE it! Sam Raimi has made the two best Spider-Man films of all time, and I don't think anyone will ever come remotely close to topping them.
10.0~Best super-hero movie since Superman II konover Sign in Permalink Spiderman is the best super-hero film since 1980's Superman II. A lot of people here compare Spiderman to the Batman movies, but in actuality, Spiderman is very close in tone to Superman II and the second-half of Superman: The Movie, (although Superman II BADLY needs a special edition since it looks a bit aged). In fact, it seems to me that Sam Raimi (allegedly a fan of the Superman movies) gave a nod to Superman when he had Peter Parker running, and opening his shirt to reveal the Spiderman costume, which Reeve did in the opening moments of Superman II and in his first "transition" in Superman: The Movie. My only complaints about the movie was that the special effects were, at times, somewhat unconvincing and the musical score lacked the majesty of the Superman and Batman themes. However, the creators of the films were able to emphasize their energy on equally, if not, more important details. I agree entirely with film critics who said Raimi and the writers were able to find the right dosage of action, drama, sympathy and humor in the story. And the result is a satisfying movie with good performances to match and mostly very good special effects to culminate with one of the best films to be based on a mainstream action-oriented character. Tobey McGuire is to Spiderman what Christopher Reeve was to Superman. McGuire BECAME Spiderman. His transformation from a picked-on teenager to superhero was wonderful acting, and I'll be looking forward to his next outing as the wall-crawler. Willem DaFoe was outstanding, as usual. I'd rank his crazed-interpretation of the Green Goblin to be up there with Jack Nicholson's The Joker. There are no lame performances in the film. Kirsten Dunst, although some say she didn't have a lot to work with, was wonderful as Mary Jane. Contrary to critics who preferred the second half of the film, I was more intrigued with Peter's growth and relationship with Mary Jane than when he engaged the Green Goblin in obligatory battle. Don't get me wrong, I also enjoyed the action, but we all know what super-hero movies are predictably about: good vs. evil. What makes them special and what sets some comic/action films apart from others are the characterizations between the kicking ass. It's the stuff that the very best super-hero films are made of: Superman I, Superman II, Batman Returns, X-Men and Spiderman are all examples of comic films that delivered the action, but also had interesting character relationships in between to bring us closer to the characters we like. No doubt the iconoclastic film buffs will come out of the woodwork in droves and look for any reason to bash Spiderman, but make no mistake. If you're even a casual fan of characters like Spiderman and don't get too caught up in the hype, you should be in for a great time.
9.0~Weave yourself into a comfy web and enjoy. Dia Klain Sign in Permalink Spiderman Spider man; a true comic book hero brought to life. A movie that delivers the action but does not take itself too seriously while it's at it. Where cheesy love lines and predictable action sequences are enjoyable and awaited rather then shunned. One problem I have with many modern superhero movies is that they totally lose the idea of `kid entertainment brought to life' and instead try to pull off some sort of Matrix. This is one of the problems I found in X Men. It took itself excessively seriously. There was absolutely no hummer in the movie what so ever. Where humor was to be expected one found heavy drama. Spiderman, on the other hand, felt like a cartoon, just with real people. The fake look of the Green Goblin was amusing, as was the swing of the `human spider' from building to towering building. This is for those Spiderman fans out there, the new and the old, this is NOT for someone in love with Blade II; they would probably do better with The Scorpion King. Know who you are and do not complain about this movie if you would not be caught dead watching the cartoon or reading the comics. The one comment I have is that it failed to explain what powers the Green Goblin had or how the second spider costume came about, other then that, the movie satisfied me perfectly.
10.0~bring on the gold medal! RingoStarRnR Sign in Permalink this movie was awesome, every i hoped it was and more. it was indeed a love story, but it didnt hurt the action and adventurous side of the movie. 2hours is indeed the perfect running time for a movie to become great, so it was great to see this movie follow the concept of great family movies by lasting over 2hrs. all the great family adventure/action movies are about 2 hrs, great films include "home alone", "goonies", "jurassic park", "indiana jones" and even "star wars". by making the movie 2hrs it created enough time to combine story telling (his childhood => how he became spiderman), love (obvious), and last but not least the action and adventure. by the way, by family movies i am specifically talking about movies that are appropiate for the whole family, and this movie fits in preety well, but dont get me wrong a 2yr old would cry in the theater cause of the green goblin, but most kids would love him. the movie incorporated special effects very well unlike the recent "blade II" where the animation was too fast and unappropiate at times. $114,000,000.... wow! this movie is certainly gonna get a medal, and i think the gold is VERY vulnerable. i would actually love to see this movie win the gold as it deserves it and it would eliminate all the titanic contreversy on how titanic didnt deserve it, which to a point i disagree. titanic is probably the "one-timer" i ever saw, as in movies that are great for one viewing and thats all, but u know how tuff it is to sit down and watch it again, also considering its got no comedy, so its unfair, but thats the reason why its not my favorite. spider-man is a movie im probably gonna see next weekend on a date, and many other times when it comes out on tv.
9.0~Sam Raimi?? You Did Good!! gigan-92 Sign in Permalink Along with "Blade 2", 2002 unleashed another superhero blockbuster "Spider-Man". The popular comic book character is brought to life and Sam Raimi brings it to life exceptionally well. The characters are now on the big screen just as they were in the comics, something fans will for sure enjoy. This movie takes the simple idea of the "accidental superhero" and it turns into something people of all ages will appreciate. The mild mannered Peter parker is played by Tobey Maguire who actually turned out to be a good choice. The rest of the cast is also well assembled, with James Franco, J.K. Simmons and Rosemary Harris. The drama is very well played and I believe audiences will enjoy watching Peter Parker's journey from ordinary nerd to a nerd with super powers. Cliff Robertson, playing Ben Parker, was great in this film and his death was a truly sad moment. Playing our villain is Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn, a.k.a. Green Goblin. It is here we first a lot of CGI being used for the action but it works very well. Spider-Man swinging through New York looks remarkable and the stunts are amazing. The Green Goblin suit is actually very different from the one seen in the TV shows and comic books themselves. It's very mechanical, looking much more like armor. It is a change that many like myself don't mind at all and other than that the villain remains the same, a psychotic terrorist. Plays the role of Spider-Man's enemy perfectly. The portrayal of the character's insanity is done just how it should've been. Danny Elfman is the composer and Spider-Man's theme sounds heroic most definitely. It seems he has a thing for hero films, starting since the original "Batman" back in 1989. Who would've guessed that Sam Raimi, the director of the "Evil Dead" films, would be able to make such a well made film. Sam Raimi, you did good.
4.0~What's the fuss all about? rwatts-1 Sign in Permalink Perhaps I was expecting too much, but after all the hype and high ratings, I found it quite disappointing. Digital effects were either "Matrix clone no. 2,347" or disorienting, and based on the angles I suspect half the webs missed their target. Realism? After being bitten by a genetically engineered super-spider would you simply say "ouch" (with very little conviction) and walk home? Like most superhero films the build-up of the first half was best, because, let's face it folks, after the first few unequal battles, it becomes clear that a superhero's life is as humdrum as the rest of the world. Seen one, seen 'em all. I think the comic did the personal stuff better.
8.0~Definitely worth seeing daedelus Sign in Permalink Jameson was well cast, Simmons did an excellent job. The web slinging scenes in Gotham make it a must to see on the big screen. I gave it an 8, upped a bit because it's spidey and well done, lowered somewhat because there was too much chick flick crap for a Marvel Comic big screen event, but only just.
8.0~Re-Spinning the Web re-Launches the Franchise, changing it into a SAM'S CLUB version of "YOUR FRIENDLY NEIGHBORHOOD SPIDER-MAN! redryan64 Sign in Permalink Now that we have 3 of the Big Screen, Blockbuster SPIDER-MAN films, it's a safe thing to write a few lines about the inaugural film. Anytime that you undertake bringing the public an adaptation of a Comic Book Feature, who has had literally hundreds (Or even thousands?) of stories via Comic Books, you're in for some special problems. He has also had a: 1) a long running Spider-Man Newspaper Comic Strip, 2) Multiple Television adaptations, both Animated and Live Action Series, and 3) huge numbers of licensed Toys, Games, Lunch Boxes, Pencil Sets, etc. Yet, no matter, the series still must be given the Royal Treatment in its Maiden Voyage. That means "back to the drawing board." And even in a strictly written origin story that stays close to the original, there are bound to be variation or elaboration on the original. This is demanded by the march of time itself. For example; would you depict the origin of Superman, rendering it in the same style of 1938? Depictions that were valid and in one day just would not be in another. A little updating of the idiom is in order. Spidey's screen origin was adapted from the earliest days of the character dating to 1962. The film got the origin out to this early 21st Century Audience; while bumping it up just a trifle;yet the original spirit is intact. In the Spider-Man Origin Story, we see a loner and unhappy nebbish, one Peter Parker. He excels in his student, but lacks physical prowess in anything athletic endeavor. He suffers low self-esteem, having no faith dealing with the others, especially the opposite sex. Peter gets bitten by a radioactive spider finding himself suddenly endowed with all of those Spider-like powers and abilities; such as strength, climbing ability, speed and the all important "Spider-sense." Having little or no interest in using his powers and abilities for the betterment of all mankind; but, rather to make himself wealthy via exhibiting himself like a common, vulgar entertainer. It is at this time where his failure to act in aiding a robbery victim proves to be a fatal mistake; as the same thug turns out to be the one responsible for killing Peter's beloved Uncle Ben. Thus our Spider-Man learns a bitter lesson in that just a little bit of getting involved would have spared Ben's life. This spectre of guilt hangs over Spider-Manall of his life. Jules Feiffer in his breakthrough work, the collection: "The Great Comic Book Heroes"*, described Spidey as the "Woody Allen of Super Heroes", reasoning that just because one is endowed with these neato Super Powers and has established his alter-ego/secret identity/Super Hero, that he wouldn't have trouble with dating girls or being plagued by acne, excessive B.O. or even a case of the "Zackleys." The difference in the dual tellings of the tale involve the venue in which that the young Mr. Parker was using in his quest in cashing in on his new-found talents for some old fashioned, cold ca$h. The comics' origin in Spiderman # 1, had Peter's being booked on a Nationally Televised Big Time Network Variety Show. It was the Comics Pages equivalent of THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW, the Sunday variety show. By contrast the first SPIDER-MAN had change of venue, making his $eeking riche$ from Show Biz to a "Taking on all comers" Wrestling Promotion. The Wrestling angle was probably more easy for today's movie goer. Our own personal favourite bit of casting is J.K. Simmons as The Daily Bugle Editor, J. Jonah Jameson. Mr. Simmons, who is possibly best known for his recurring part as Psychologist Dr. Emil Skoda, on Law & Order, really gets to ham it up in this role, which is really a sort of caricature of all of those hard-boiled Newspaper Editors that have been so prominent in our Hollywood Films for the last 70-80 years or so. Furthermore, Mr. Simmons is of the right age to have grown up with the Spider-Man saga; and doubtless would have to be well acquainted with his personality. We thought that the casting was over-all at least adequate, with most parts being manned by actors (and actresses) who were excellent in their roles. We are especially pleased with Toby Maguire in the lead & title role. We kinda woulda liked it if they woulda let Peter Parker use his glasses a little longer, as the specs were an everyday part of the wardrobe to the early Spidey Stories. (But that's just a small and very insignificant point.) The biggest boner was their making the ability to spin his web to being a part of his own biological metamorphosis, rather than its being a mechanical dispenser worn on the wrists. They will get by with it as long as they don't dwell on it. So, just pretend it never happened; and we'll all feel better. The screen version of The Green Goblin as portrayed by Mr. Willam Dafoe is quite energetic and an excellent choice for their inaugural Spidey venture. The theme of the over accumulation of power by the Military-Industrial Complex, in keeping with the words of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, as well as a true to life problem. NOTE: * In 1965, the publication of Mr. Feiffer's THE GREAT COMIC BOOK HEROES, books on Comic Strips and especially ones about Comic Books were unheard of. The big book stores in Downtown Chicago; like Kroch's & Brentano's, didn't know where to display the books for sale; as they, at this point, had no such designated "Comics" section.
10.0~Wow!! hunter_rose Sign in Permalink Its so rare to find a movie where everything works. Especially when it comes to comic book films, but Spider-Man nails it dead on. The quiet scenes really hammered home the weight of the responsibility Peter feels, especially at the end. There's a kind of infectious joy when Peter's discovering his powers that stays with you whenever he's swinging through the city. Superman, Batman, X-Men are all very good superhero movies, Spider-Man is better. Can't wait to see it again, nor can I wait for the inevitable sequels. I just hope they stay away from the "mulitple villains are better" theory.
10.0~best super hero film jetersb02 Sign in Permalink I went to see this film about a week ago thinking it was gonna be terrible. usually these moneymaking hyped up films are pretty bad( phantom menace, titanic) however i have to admit i was pretty entertained. The special effects were breathtaking, sometimes i actually felt like i was saoring new york city right behind spiderman. the action was great, the acting was great too. Some people have told me they thought toby maguire was terrible as peter parker. this is absurded, maguire did just what he had to do and brought emotion and life into parker. Something that keaton, kilmer, and clooney failed to do with wayne.dafoe was excellent as the green goblin. i liked him in this role and was glad to see him execute it with such devilish charm. the only downfall of this movie is the green goblin costume. It looked like a power ranger. I think more imagination could have gone into that. besides that this movie lived up to the hype and i went away from it realizing why it made so much money. Few films fail to accomplish this. I would recomend this film to anyone. 10/10stars
9.0~best comic book to screen movie made thus far danterp Sign in Permalink This movie was everything you could want when going to see a movie as an escape from reality. I've seen the Supermans and the Batmans, but this movie was truly fun. There wasn't a second where I lost interest. The casting was brilliant and the transfer from comic book to screen only had a few small holes. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to have a fun evening at the theatre. p.s. Kirsten Dunst is gorgeous.
10.0~This one is a winner! mm-39 Sign in Permalink This is the best comic character since Batman. In fact, I liked this a lot better than Batman. It did not have any slow spots. The acting was well and the characters fitted the comic book characters to a tee. I can not wait for the sequel. I wonder who the villain will be. The special affects were good, but you could tell some was computer graphics. A must see. 10/10
9.0~Raimi strikes perfect balance, remains true to original. bill-stollard Sign in Permalink Finally, a hero saga that is true to the spirit of the original! This was a welcome surprise after a long, arduous development period with many high-profile directors attached to the project, including James Cameron. After seeing the great job that Cameron did with the character development in `Titanic', I had great hopes for this move, but became very concerned when he bowed out. I'm glad to say that Sam Raimi struck the right balance between action and character. He demonstrated that he `gets' why The Amazing Spider-Man comic book was so popular and why Stan Lee's and Steve Ditko's creation ushered in the second Golden Age of comics. It centered on a very relatable Peter Parker - who struggled with real issues - not some unreachable super hero. Raimi allows just enough Stan `The Man' Lee corny dialogue to satisfy any long-standing Marvel Comics True Believer, such as when Green Goblin taunts Spidey with, `I could crush you like a bug!' This is a truly satisfying movie, recommended to True Believers and Spidey novices alike. This reviewer predicts that `Spider-Man' will set the tone for super hero motion pictures just like the comic set the tone for super hero comics in the 1960's and beyond.
8.0~2 Stupid things, I was angry, but not a bad movie... homerinvests Sign in Permalink When I left this movie I was a little angry and frustrated. If I had written this review the second I had stepped out of the theatre, I probably would of ranked it a 6. I was angry and frustrated because of two stupid things. The first stupid thing was an action on my part - going to the 1pm Saturday matinee. Why was this stupid? - Because I should have foreseen the second stupid thing, PARENTS! I don't know, but I'm thinking here that a movie doesn't get a PG-13 rating simply so that 5 year olds will have a baby-sitter at the movie. Maybe, just maybe some things may not be appropriate for kids UNDER 13. I won't pretend to be a parenting expert, but is it a stretch of common sense to think that parents may do a little investigation before bringing their young ones to the movie? Maybe it was the kid crying on and off behind me, or the one to my left somewhere asking 'why?' or 'how come?' every 5 minutes, or the one immediately to my right that would duck down behind the seat in front of her every scary/action scene until her mom said it was OK to look again... Needless to say, this atmosphere took something away from the ambiance. The Movie: Now, the day after, I've had some time to think about the movie and I would rate it 7 or 8. It was fun and I thought the comic feeling was adapted well. The change from nerd to superhero kept the first half or more of the show moving along nicely. Peter discovering his abilities, and testing the limits of those abilities provided many memorable scenes and quite a few chuckles throughout the theatre (and a bunch of 'how come?' questions from my left- grin). Through all this Peter still came across as a 'typical teen'. Also, I thought the irony of the, "I fail to see how this is my problem" sequence was so true to life...How often have we not done something we could of, or not done something as well as possible only to have it later cause us problems (or grief)? Without giving anything away, I liked the way all the loose ends weren't neatly tied off, and I liked the fact that some things didn't turn out as good as you could hope for Spider-man. On the negative side, I thought the movie dragged a bit in the second half building up to the final battle. Maybe not so much that it dragged, but I got the feeling they had emptied there bag of superhero tricks and surprises and were treading water for a while. Overall, atmosphere aside, I enjoyed the movie, and would say Spider-man was successful in his leap to the big screen.
8.0~Who am I? The Human-Spider! thesar-2 Sign in Permalink I should really give 2009's 'Avatar' a chance. When I watched the recent trailers, the blue fish people look really fake in the trailer and it makes me either not want to see it or go for a good laugh. In 2002, I said the same thing about 'Spider-Man.' Spidey looked so fake in the trailer and the action/swinging was so slowed down, I almost didn't see it. Nevertheless, I gave it a chance opening weekend and waited a long time in line. Man, I was not disappointed. Somewhere in translation, they sped up the action sequences and you truly believed Spider-Man was swinging from building to building, fighting, etc. But, there was more to this movie, much more. Director Raimi and writer Koepp added so much depth to the characters, setting and took Stan Lee's age-old teenage comic book hero to new heights, literally. I've always loved the talent of Maguire (Peter Parker/Spider-Man) but you really felt every blow, physical or mental, he went through. Simmons (J. Jonah Jameson) and Harris (Aunt May) were absolutely perfect from the comic books I grew up on. Oh, and I always love Bruce Campbell (aside from 'My Name is Bruce') so I am glad Raimi loves to continue to use him. Unfortunately, not everyone was pitch-perfect. Dunst (Mary Jane "MJ" Watson) was just "okay" though she did seem to act her heart out in each scene. (Strangely, I always envisioned her with rich red and curly hair – of which neither were true, though she did have just barely a red-tint.) And what was with the Green Goblin/Norman Osborn (Dafoe)? Sure, in the 'strip he's either literally green or in a costume – I can't remember him much, he was always my least favorite of Spidey's villains. I guess they needed to upgrade to make him more believable with a horrid mask (again, I'm guess, that's the best they could come up with) which didn't make much scene, since supposedly they made the suit/mask before Osborn went wacko, and it just happened to look sadistic? At any rate, they did a fantastic job, making you truly believe in Spider-Man/Parker and all of his troubles and triumphs while keeping to the core of the always-broke, always-bantered teen who's trying to do good and always vying for the girl (MJ.) Here we have the origin story of Spider-Man, but, like 'Superman: The Movie,' you won't see the super-hero in red/blue tights until about half-way through. You'll be fully introduced to this nerd, his girl-next-door crush, his living arrangement with Aunt/Uncle and the infamous bite that spawned the teen web-slinger. Meanwhile, in the movie's weakest story, Pete's best friend's Dad experiments on himself with some green smoke that, well, uh, makes him stronger and angry. Not Hulk angry – though he's got the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde thing going on, but just upset at those that are against the green smoke in the first place and eventually, of course, Spider-Man. This is one of the same problems I had with 'Daredevil's completely underdeveloped super-villain "Bullseye." You're simply asked to believe these two bad-guys have some kind of super-power and that they want to rid the city of the hero because, well, it said so in the comic books. The only other flaw I could tell (and Raimi never seemed to correct this in the following two sequels) was the length. All three movies (so far) are way too long with scenes that could've obviously been trimmed. Granted, this one is the best paced one, but standing alone, it still could've been cut easily down 20-25 minutes. Nevertheless, the movie, as a whole, is highly recommended. The fantastic score (one of Elfman's best,) graphics, dialogue, comedy, romance & longing and the setup were all great. It was a perfect introduction to the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. It can easily be viewed by all audiences, and they did a great job of making it almost virtually timeless so it can be enjoyed by generations to follow. So, thanks Spidey, you not only saved the city and the girl (oops, spoiler), but you might've persuaded me to buy a ticket to help probably the most expensive movie ever, 'Avatar,' make back at least one ticket's worth.
10.0~Absolutely Wonderful TheGrinch Sign in Permalink This was the other movie I saw dubbed in Russian. Like Star Wars, I didn't catch all of it, but what I missed seemed to be unimportant. This movie was so exciting, and very well done. I wasnt a bit disapointed. It was great in the cinemas. Very highly recommended.
9.0~Can you spell box office gold? policy134 Sign in Permalink Like so many have mentioned in their comments, to think that Tobey Maguire would be the best choice for a role as a superhero would have been highly unlikely if you judged him solely on his performance in "Cider House Rules" or "Pleasantville". But let us not forget that Spiderman's alter ego, Peter Parker is somewhat of a nerd and that is something that Maguire really does resemble (not to insult him). The film itself is a high concept FX extravaganza in the highest form but the story that goes along with it is very compelling. The best scenes are the ones that describes the relationships between the characters, be they between PP and MJ, or between PP and Harry Osborn. It is rare to have a movie that mixes these elements and somehow makes the both work. Superman was quite boring when you didn't see him battle the forces of evil. And speaking of Superman, Peter Parker chooses a similar vocation as Clark Kent, although it is as a photographer, not reporter. That is also somehow connected to Peter Parker's character because before he develops his sense he is more of an observer than a man who interacts with anybody. As for the villain, (there must be an interesting one to make a superhero movie) Willem Dafoe couldn't have been a better choice. The scenes where he shows his affection for both his son and Peter Parker are in sharp contrast to what he will become and it shows that he can play both sides equally well. However, the scene where he talks to his lord and master is annoyingly silly and that somehow makes the dilemma he faces later on less serious because everything is explained beforehand. Peter's love interest MJ (played by the luscious Kirsten Dunst) is nothing short of inspired casting. Instead of having some ultra-glamorous movie queen, we have the girl-next-door and she still seems sexy. Peter Parker's decision at the end regarding her was also the one great surprise that many would say is not that great but that I found totally believable. I haven't seen the second part yet but if rumour is true that it is better than the first one, I can only be glad.
9.0~~ Web-Slinging Fun ~ Aysen08 Sign in Permalink Normally I can't stand movies derived from comics, for example the duds that were the Hulk & Daredevil, but this one surprised me. An excellent take on the comic book character created by Stan Lee. Next to the X-Men movies that came out about the same time, and Superman with Christopher Reeve, it is definitely one of the better Comic to Movie films put out. The cast is well chosen. McGuire is Spiderman/Peter Parker to me. I don't think they could have chosen better. Kirsten Dunst makes a decent Mary Jane Watson, wasn't ever fond of her to begin with, but it's pulled off well. Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin is sheer genius. The story is well written and keeps you along for the entire ride, coupled with action that's explosive and thrilling. Definitely fun for all, even die hard Spidey fans won't be disappointed! Fun for all! 9/10.
10.0~Mother of god,such a grand motion picture for a Sci - Fic. SeeDaveFlip Sign in Permalink What a movie.Such a great cast,plot,and effects.It's on my favorites list.A movie made by creative people.Before I saw it,when I found out that Toby Maguire stared,I knew it would be a big box office loser.Since Wilem Dafoe was the Green Goblin,it couldn't be so bad.It was a hit.I was spun away.When I left, it became my favorite movie (now Chicago is).
10.0~AMAZING!!! spikelovesbuffy2002 Sign in Permalink This movie really rocks it is one of my favirote movie's lots of action, love, funny part. This movie like had everything i really liked the special effects really great job the acting was terrific! There was a very strong storyline it kept you watching not thinking when is this boring part going to end! It showed how the birth of spiderman happened not just starting off with spiderman. I liked how it started of as peter parker being a major geek and then when he gets his powers he doesnt take crap from anybody, Now the love was very good in this movie it showed how Mary Jane was some really cool girl that had tons of friend big boy friend and everything and Peter just was some normal kid has one good friend and lived with his aunt may and uncle ben, And it showed how nice Peter was to Mary Jane like when Mary Jane's Dad told her to come in the damn house to make dinner, And she was crying and everything and Peter cherred her up by telling her dont worry about it your a pretty girl, So that was good. Willam Dafoe did really good in this movie i think no one else can play the green goblin like willam defoe the story is good as troubles are all coming on Peter Parker when he got his powers he started to act kinda big and bad not hanging with his aunt and uncle too much and it was so sad how his uncle died cause it was Peter's fault (dont mean to sound like a the bad guy) and then it was aunt may going to the hospital after a visit from the goblin then greeny went to far taking Peter's love Mary Jane to the brige where spiderman had to make a nerve racking decision wheter to save his girlfriend or the chrildren evendently spiderman saved both and after killed the green goblin. What i REALLY liked about this movie was the end when there in the cemetery and Mary and Peter are talking and mary kisses Peter and Peter says "I cant" and Mary said "cant what" then he said cant love u (because everyone one he loves goes in danger) so while hes walking away Mary finds out so now i think Mary Jane will know hes spiderman and tell him. GREAT MOVIE 10 out of 10 stars!!!!!!
8.0~Good film... Toxicwasteland Sign in Permalink I recently rewatched this film. It actually is very good. I changed my rating from a 6 to an 8. Don't know why I had it so low in the first place. I still think they should have kept a lot more of the original script. Good think they took out Doc Ock, though but it would have been awesome having Green Goblin and Doc Ock teaming up against Spidey. In the original script he had more interactions with Flash, was a little bit more action packed, and was more true to the original material but I can see why they cut it down because with all that it would have been a very long movie. This movie is great but I never really felt Tobey was right for the part having read the comics. In this film he portrays Peter Parker very well but in the sequels the character becomes him. Out of the trilogy this one is my favourite. Number 2 was good but was too corny for my liking. I am in support of the reboot but this is a film I will always love deep down inside. This will always be the classic but I have a feeling the new reboot will be better. That's my opinion though.
8.0~Great debut! jeff7540 Sign in Permalink the story goes as follows Peter Parker is just a regular school nerd who gets picked on one day he gets bit by a spider and has all their amazing abilities he at first uses them for fun and money but after seeing Uncle Ben get killed he makes a commitment to use his powers for good meanwhile Norman Osborn does an experiment in Oscorp laboratories which turns him into his psychotic alter ego Green Goblin now he must protect everyone he loves and battle the green goblin before he kills them this I find is a good action movie I got it for Christmas in 2003 and I liked it so a little over three years and three months later in 2006 I got Spider-man 2 anyway this its good that Marvel is turning most of its comics into movies they've been doing it since 2002
10.0~Enjoyable, if flawed, super-hero flick anne-25 Sign in Permalink *Spoiler I have to admit that I had my reservations about Spider-Man when I went to see it for the first time, in fact, it was really only my sister's recommendations of the film that managed to get me into the cinema. As a long-term, if occasionally disinterested, Spidey fan I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the film, starting with the excellent opening sequence. I must also give praise to Danny Elfman's musical score, which really heightened the emotional tension and un-natural atmosphere of the film, just as it did in Batman. As Peter Parker, Tobey Maguire was as good, I think, as anyone they could have gotten for the role and I can't think of anyone who could have portrayed Peter better. Yet as Spider-Man, I was a little dismayed about his comic delivery, although to be fair the comic material in the script was rather poor. As for the rest of the cast, I thoroughly enjoyed Kirsten Dunst's performance as Mary-Jane, although I didn't like it how the script-writers turned her character into some helpless damsel in distress who needs to be saved all the time. James Franco portrayed Harry Osborn excellently, really making the audience feel for an average, under-achieving teen who has been lumbered with a genius father who feels ashamed of him. Willem Dafoe WAS the Green Goblin, I thought he was perfect as the schizophrenic Norman Osborn, although I didn't like the Green Goblin costume, finding it too reminiscent of "Power-Rangers" for my tastes, I would have preffered the Green Goblin to resemble more closely the comic-book character, perhaps if the human enhancers Oscorp were developing had been organic instead of some robotic-armour. That aside, the only snivelling little complaints are as follows: 1.) How come Mary Jane has to slog her guts out as a waitress when she has a millionairre boyfriend? 2.) On that note, why does Peter have to risk severe injury wrestling to save enough money to buy a car? why doesn't he just ask his super-rich best friend Harry if he can loan him some money to buy a car? 3.) Isn't it a tad strange how Peter Parker and Norman Osborn both have their little "accidents" at exactly the same time? That said, Spider-Man does seem to establish himself before the Green Goblin. Anyway, who cares what I think?, the film is still the best super-hero film to date and well worth the admission fee. Fortunately enough I don't have to worry about that since I own the film on DVD having bought a rather dodgy copy from the far east from an even dodgier store-owner, and let me tell you! the English subtitles are sooooo Cool/Bad!(e.g With Gay Power comes Gay responsibility) and Mary-Jane now wants an "axe" instead of "act". Anyway, I should stop babbling, 8/10.
8.0~Three Syllables for ya... A-Maze-Ing dcsbebe Sign in Permalink I thought this movie was fantastic. Great special effects!!! The acting was pretty good too... Tobey Maguire was perfect for the part and he really got beefy for the role. Good job Tobey, i'm really digging the muscles ;). At some parts of the movie there was just a little too much action continuously without any breaks... i thought they could've fixed that and maybe had more of a buildup to the action sequences so it made u sit on the edge of your seat. I loved it, i think everyone (even non-spiderman fans) will love this movie. Two Thumbs Up!!
10.0~2002 just may have been Stan Lee's annus mirabilis lee_eisenberg Sign in Permalink I'll admit that I've never really been into comic books (or do people like to call them "graphic novels"?). But whether you're into them or not, "Spider-Man" is sure to blow you away. More than just a superhero story, it shows how, as the title character reminds us: "With great power comes great responsibility." As Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Tobey Maguire brings to the screen a superhero with whom we can all identify: misunderstood and searching for his goal in life. And Willem Dafoe makes one nasty, but cool, Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. Other cast members include Kirsten Dunst as Peter's love interest Mary Jane Watson; James Franco as Peter's friend (and Norman's son) Harry; Cliff Robertson as Peter's uncle Ben; and Rosemary Harris as Peter's aunt May. I also have to admit that around the time when this movie came out was the first time that I'd ever heard of Stan Lee (who appears in the movie briefly). Right before the release, he made a guest appearance on "The Simpsons" (the episode where Bart creates an online cartoon about Homer's mishaps). Two thousand two must have been a great year for Lee. All in all, you're sure to love this movie. I also recommend "Weird" Al Yankovic's song "Ode to a Superhero" (parodying "Piano Man"), about the movie. Just great. I guess that Rosemary Harris is probably the only actress who can lay claim to starring in a movie about Hungary's history ("Sunshine") and a superhero movie.
8.0~Well done - can't wait for the sequel timefreezer7 Sign in Permalink Directed by Sam Raimi Written by David Koepp Starring: Tobey Maguire , Willem Dafoe , Kirsten Dunst and James Franco After years of anticipation and a never ending court battle concerning the legal rights , a big budget cinematic adaptation of the well known comics superhero has finally made it to the movie theaters . First of all I should say I was never much of a Spider-man fan , I have never read comics but is there any person on earth who doesn't know the red clad hero who jumps from building to building ? I doubt so . My only knowledge of Spider-man was some cartoon show where he makes a dynamic trio with Iceman and Fire-Star . I am not aware of anyone of Spidey's enemies and I was not familiar with his origin and motives . Nevertheless I am keen on comics generally and I always like seeing comics characters materialize on celluloid . So I got really excited when I heard that the project FINALLY got green-lighted and that Sam Raimi eventually took it upon him to shoot the Spider-man motion picture . I will have to admit that most of the comments are 100% right . Spider-man (2002) may not be a GREAT film but it sure is a good one (and it beats the hell out of the overrated and disappointing 2000's X-Men) . I don't think the plot is significant . The movie remains as faithfully to its comics origins as it could be and it satisfies both the hardcore well-knowing fans and the uninitiated like I am . Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy 17 year old student , not much accepted by his social environment and constantly being picked by his bullies classmates . He has a secret crush on the beautiful girl next door Mary Jane `M.J.' Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but she hardly knows he exists . When he is bitten by a mutated super spider he is bestowed with special powers like climbing on windows with his bare (albeit sticky) hands , ejecting spider nets from his arms , incredible acrobatic agility and enhanced danger-approaching instinct. While he tries to adjust to his newly obtained powers he finds himself caught in a war that a fiendish super criminal called the Green Goblin has declared against him . The Green Goblin is a maniac who wreaks havoc and kills innocent people using military equipment and weaponry . He believes that Spider-Man is the only real threat and wants to bring him down . The Green Goblin is actually the alter-ego of Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) a very wealthy businessman / scientist who has started developing a split personality and the deranged Green Goblin becomes more and more dominant driving him to madness . Norman's son is Harry (James Franco) who coincidentally is Peter's best friend and classmate . So Spider-Man will try to stop the Green Goblin before he kills more civilians and simultaneously will try to get Mary Jane's attention . That's it folks . The film spends much more time on the love story between Peter and Mary Jane and less on action . I always like character development and human relationships unfolded in superhero films but a little more action wouldn't heart either . Basically we see Spider-Man beat up some random thugs on alley streets and that's it . The balloon sequence in the middle of the film is nice but awfully reminiscent of Batman (1989) . I wish there were more epic battles between Spider-man and Green Goblin with more explosions . Some other things I didn't like either were : 1) Even worse CGI SFX than the robot soldiers in the Phantom Menace !!! I never thought it could happen but here it is . The shots of Spider-Man in the beginning of the film jumping from the top of a building to another is a lame cartoon that will not convince even a 3 year old viewer . I cannot describe how laughable and fake this Spider-man cartoon is : you will have to see for yourselves . 2) The acting is average from all the actors . None of them manages to deliver fully the dramatic depth of the characters as scripted by the writer. The worst performance belongs to Willem Dafoe . His mirror communication scene was nicely scripted but Dafoe is extremely bad and unconvincing . What exactly happened here ? I liked him in Body of Evidence and Speed II but his talents seem to have been erased in this film . I will have to admit that some of the Green Goblin's lines gave me the creeps but can anyone assure me that it was really him under the suit (or his voice for that matter) ? Maguire's and Dunst's acting is better but still mediocre . Speaking of the duo , one other flaw is that they don't have enough chemistry together (like Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder) . If they made a more fitting pair the screen time spent in their romance would be more worthily used . And if James Franco has the most impact screen presence is because his character requires for him to sit back and look calm and cool (and it is obvious that's the reason why they cast him) . The secondary characters like Peter's uncle and aunt act OK but that newspaper editor was too annoying to like him. 3) The Green Goblin is never developed and is not much of a formidable foe . Maybe it was intentional to give him little screen time in order not to pull another scene-stealer (a la Joker) and give all the focus on Spider-Man . Unfortunately a great action film always needs a powerful evil character to be the opposition AND the driving force for the hero's existence . Aside from these flaws the movie has all the features of a good blockbuster . The red suit of Spider-Man is faithful and really convinces us that the character has come to life ! There are some good scenes like the one where Peter finally beats up one the bullies in school . My favorite scene in the movie is a great surprise and that's why I cannot give it away. All I can say if you haven't watched the film , is the sequence where the Green Goblin sings `The itsy , bitsy spider.' . I also digged the final duel between Spider-Man and Green Goblin . Without being too violent it is an exciting fight , larger-than-life and worth our money . I just wish the rest of the movie reached the same adrenaline levels . Despite a lackluster performance , Tobey Maguire was perfectly cast as Peter Parker . He suits the geeky looks the character has and convinces as a 17 year old with continually growing power (physical and personal) . The film has an obvious open end as a set up for the sequel . Much like some recent blockbusters like the Matrix or X-Men the first film is clearly an introductory chapter wanting to lure the audience to a whole franchise . You wait for more action in the next film , more exploitation of the potential of the story and you have a curiosity to find out where the relationships between the protagonists will lead . Spider-Man however manages to rise above the aforementioned films . Why ? Because it is a GOOD introduction . Where X-Men made the mistake of under using 10 characters without any success , Spider-Man has ONE main character . This is what I like most about Raimi's film . We follow Peter Parker from the very beginning . We have a taste of his life before the drastic change occurs and then we have the transformation in front of our eyes full play ! There is not a single superhero film that bothered to show us the beginning of the character . Obviously they thought it would be dull for the already initiated comic book fans but they were wrong . Yes there are other films with scenes were the motives were explained like Batman and some opening establishing scenes like the first Superman . But Raimi's Spider-Man is unique : we SEE Peter Parker training with his super powers , trying to control them and we even get to see him pick his costume . Now I will keep my reservations because I have yet to see the recent batch of Marvel comic-book adaptations like Daredevil or Hulk but for now Spider-Man is the best introducing film you will find . The metaphor about the responsibility of a teenager turned into a mature adult is also explored . The realistic approach is successful here . First of all the first thing Peter does with his powers is to try earning money . Only later he decides to use them for the city 's good and safety . Secondly despite some nitpicking from fans it is quite logical that Spider-man's web-shooting is an organic power . Peter is just 17 and as much as he is supposed to be a science genius he wouldn't have the money or the technology to invent some synthetic web shooters . The Green Goblin outfit sure looks like a Power Ranger suit but it is also realistic as it is a piece of military equipment and not a Halloween costume . New York City is depicted as a shiny town and establishes a truly existing environment for the story to take place . Spider-Man (2002) for all its weaknesses is a good film with some of the best narrative I have seen . The voice-overs by Maguire help us identify with him even more . The film is better than some other comic book flicks like Phantom or Spawn (not entirely their fault since these characters are less appealing and therefore less known) Dick Tracy , The Mask or the Shadow (good idea but mediocre script / execution) or over hyped blockbusters like the X-Men . It will not be a classic like Superman II or Batman but it is one of the best of the bunch of the `comic-book' genre . I rank it up there with the 3 Batman sequels , Judge Dredd and the original Superman . SPIDER-MAN (2002) 8 / 10
10.0~Spectacular vampirepandorina Sign in Permalink If you think you know comic book movies, this one will blow your mind. I love it, to say the least. The action, the drama, the comedy it's all here. This is the best adaptation of a Marvel character to date. If you love Spiderman comics or cartoons you won't be disappointed.
10.0~Finally, a summer blockbuster that has some substance. Spoonmonitor Sign in Permalink I think that Spiderman, much like Lord Of The Rings, is one hyped movie that actually delivers on its hype and then some. As everyone has said, Tobey Maguire is perfect as Peter Parker. His Peter Parker has a lot of depth and anguish to it, and it made me care about what happens to him. I usually don't like Kirsten Dunst much, but I thought she nailed the character of Mary Jane. And I give credit to the filmmakers for not casting a supermodel actress to play Mary Jane, because they have done so in the past (Rebecca Romjin-Stamos as Mystique in "X-Men") and they could have very easily done it in this movie. I'm really happy that Sam Raimi was chosen to direct, because he has the campy background (Evil Dead...enough said) in order to pull off some of the more implausible scenes without breaking a sweat. He also knows how to portray superheroes with emotion and poise, no matter who they are (see Darkman). This movie has quite a few similarities to Darkman (in a good way). The action was very cool, and I'm sure they will have more in the sequel, but I'm glad they didn't overload on it. It kept the movie from being shallow, because too many action movies rely on action than on story. The humorous subtext is there, the costume is there, the performances are there, and the great special effects are there. All in all, it was a very entertaining movie not just because of the action, but because it had a story that a viewer could identify with, and it had a love story that people can believe. It is the best movie about a superhero since Batman, it's a great movie to take the kids to, and it's full of old wisdom and glory that many modern actioners are devoid of. The sequel cannot come fast enough. Overall, an entertaining and fulfulling time at the movies. I give it a 9.5 out of 10 (I deducted half a point because I wanted more action).
7.0~OK, but... bill_b4 Sign in Permalink Be forewarned...Spoilers Ahead: As a big fan of the comic book, I definitely enjoyed the movie, but had some small bones to pick and thankfully, IMDB provides the skeletal material. Firstly, the movie, although good, is over-hyped. As of 7 May 02, the movie has a rating of 8.4, which is comparable to much better movies, such as The Matrix. Perhaps this could be indicative of the excitement of a well-done newly released movie and will level out to a more realistic, better-deserved rating as time goes by. However, this particular phenomenon sort of concerns me because it hints at the possibility that movie ratings may be, for whatever reason, over-hyped in the short term after an initial release. My main worry is that Hollywood has somehow figured out how to initially stack the deck, deceiving loyal IMDB participants, such as myself. I will definitely be more guarded about the IMDB rating of movies after initial releases, and this may mean I will have to wait a movie out after a couple of weeks and then see how the ratings fare. My other thoughts about the movie, although trivial, add up to a small degree of disappointment, and, in my opinion, detracted from the overall enjoyability. For one, if the movie had spent an equal amount of time depicting Peter Parker's scientific ingenuity as they had showing his eye for design (such as when drawing up plans for his costume), the audience would have had no problem believing that he could create web shooters, such as he did for the comic book. I thought the spinerettes inside his wrists interesting and was thankful the writers opted for his wrists over the spider's preternatural ability to shoot silk out it's rear. Another point of contention was the look of the green goblin. It seemed in the comic book that the goblin's mask was of a more rubber material, and definitely not the rigid, molded plastic depicted in the film. The look of the goblin from the comic was much more menacing, and those of you who may doubt it only have to view Maximum Overdrive and tell me that the truck with the green goblin's face, taken directly from the comic, does not send chills up your spine. Additionally, in the comic book, Peter Parker cleverly taunted his enemies while in battle, making it easy for fights to take a much more serious tone when Spider Man's wit would be replaced by less witty diatribe. It's been years since reading spider-man comic books, but one of the more heartening plot twists from early on in the comic was Peter Parker's love interest with the daughter of a police captain...I think her name was Gwen. And I believe the green goblin tried to kill her in the comic by throwing her off of a bridge, similar to the plot line from the movie. However, unlike the movie, Gwen died while Spider-Man tried to rescue her. A female friend by the name of Mary Jane Watson tried to console him through his loss and Peter Parker ended up falling in love with her. Now I don't know if they could have included those much sadder plot twists for the movie, but as a fan of the comic book, these scenarios resulted in more deeply endearing the characters to me. If I remember correctly, another interesting plot development was when Gwen's father, the police captain, was also killed (I think much earlier than Gwen's demise) while Spidey battled Dr. Octopus. Is Hollywood afraid such loss would negatively impact ticket sales? They should look at Marvel's sales within said plot lines and I think they'd see that the tragic loss resulted in a more loyal fan base. If anyone doubts it, look what the death of Obi Wan did for the fans of Star Wars. One of the more saddening, but poignant points to the comic book series was how many of Peter Parker's closest friends and acquaintances, would die off. Uncle Ben, the police captain, and Gwen, among others. Lastly, even though casting was for the most part dead-on, the choice of JK Simmons to play JJ Jameson left much to be desired. And I say that as a fan of Law & Order and his recurring role as the psychologist. Of course I'm arm-chair quaterbacking here, but I feel that there could have been a better choice, although I thought JK Simmons did exceptionally well. Please don't let my comments prevent you from seeing the movie. Even though I believe an 8.4 rating is much too high for it, it is still a well-done, enjoyable movie, more along the lines of a 7 out of 10 rating. It was for the most part faithful to the plot lines of the comic book, and therefore, captivating and interesting.
7.0~Jon Monsarrat review: Better than X-Men, mix of good & cheesy johnnymonsarrat Sign in Permalink Let me start by saying that I am not a crazy-eyed comic book fan. I acknowledge that Superman and the gang are pretty silly and due for an update and revamp. Audiences have gotten a lot more sophisticated since the 1950s. Spider-Man has stood out as more modern and intelligent among comic heros. But so is Batman, and look what happened to his shtick-from-hell sub-intellectual movies. So, I was fearful but hopeful that Spider-Man would do better that the X-Men, which took a stab at deep characterization that didn't come off, and whose visuals and action were overly cheesy. Spider-Man succeeded. The first half of the film is a real delight, being the origin of Spider-Man. Tobey Maguire, who I enjoyed in "Cider House Rules" and "Wonder Boys", carried the film, and is destined for an Academy Award at some point in my opinion. The filmmakers pass up numerous opportunities to be cheesy, making it solid and real and making Peter Parker out to be a regular guy who's just so well-meaning and so down-trodden. Believe it or not, it brought tears to my eyes, and I'm not an emotional film-goer (got through E.T. dry-eyed). Unfortunately, the second half of the film devolves into the X-Men style campiness. I think there was probably too much plotting, trying to cram in a lot of the Spider-Man story, and in the rush it didn't have the emotional impact of the first half. Bigger, bigger, yet bigger stunts, but sort of haphazardly thrown together (who's responsible for that, the cinematographer?). Flying around, computer graphics, even shouting cheezy lines back and forth between good guys and bad guys. I was most disappointed in the acting by Kirsten Dunst, the silliness of the Green Goblin costume, and the city scenes which were obviously sets. Also, since there have been many Spider-Man enemies, it's a shame they chose the Green Goblin, one of the sillier baddies. I think they should have gone for the Octopus guy instead, or Kingpin. Overall, it was certainly worth seeing for someone like me with an affinity for comics. I doubt it will win the "golden prize" which is being a big hit with the broader mainstream, however. Who should see this film: -- Action film buffs who got through The X-Men; this one's better and a whole lot better than any of the Batman films -- Comic book fans -- a must-see -- Tobey Maguire fans, but don't expect any deep romance. I'll give this film a 7 out of 10, the average of a great first half and a so-so second half.
10.0~excellent, claire_s1 Sign in Permalink I wasn't usually into action films, but when i saw it i was taken away! the graphics are excellent and the story line keeps you on the edge of your seat. The are many genres in this film, romance, thriller, action etc. I rate it the best film i've seen for a few years.. Definatly will buy it on DVD.
7.0~This Looks Kind of Familiar bsmith5552 Sign in Permalink "Spider-Man" is a very entertaining and well produced movie. The special effects are very realistic and seamless with the live action. But as I watched it, I had the feeling of deja vu. The story is simple. Nerdy teenager Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is bitten by a genetically altered spider and begins to take on the characteristics of the insect. He then begins to battle the forces of evil in the city and faces off against another genetically altered being called The Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). The similarities between this film and the first two Superman movies is more than coincidental. For example, Parker is orphaned and cared for by an aunt (Rosemary Harris) and uncle (Cliff Robertson) who dies tragically as was the case with Clark Kent. Spider-Man battles the super human Green Goblin. Superman battled three super villains. Spider-man's rescue of the heroine Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst)from the top of a collapsing building is almost identical to Superman's rescue of Lois Lane in the first Superman movie. J.K. Simmons plays a Perry white like character called J. Jonah Jameson and so on. The boyish looking Maguire is surprisingly good in the lead role and Dunst is suitably fresh and innocent as the girl who loves Spider-Man but the one that Peter Parker can't have (shades of Lois Lane?)and veterans Robertson and Harris are good as the aunt and uncle. Dafoe on the other hand, is way over the top as the villain but then how else could he have played him. Simmons equally hams it up as the newspaper editor. Even though "Spider-Man borrows heavily from Superman it is nonetheless a very exciting and entertaining two hours thanks mainly to Tobey Maguire.
10.0~Absolutely marvelous! Thorne_Dust Sign in Permalink I saw this movie last night and I must say that every aspect of this movie blew my expectations out of the water. I've been watching the progress of this movie for some time, and I was honestly expecting it to be great only in the eyes of us true Spiderman fans, but as I sat in the theatre I noticed something. There were old people, young people, people of all races, people who had been Spiderman fans their whole lives, and people who had only heard of Spiderman. And we were all in there watching Spiderman together. This movie really crosses boundaries and no matter who you are, there is something in this movie for you. As the movie progressed, some teary moments came and there wasn't a dry eye in the house. For just a brief moment in time, everyone got a glimpse of what it is like in Peter Parker's everyday life. When the phrase "Go for the ultimate spin" is used in advertising the Spiderman movie, know that they are telling the truth. It is the ultimate spin. And the Spiderman line "With great power comes great responsibility" was demonstrated flawlessly. As a matter of fact, even Stan Lee has been quoted as saying that the movie was actually an improvement on the comic book. And I would have to say that yes, I agree with Stan.
8.0~Great!!! huggy_bear Sign in Permalink I loved this movie. Simple and to the point. My favorite, the Green Goblin!! The action scenes were great, and I have to say, I would see this one again. Dafoe did a great job as the Goblin, and the special effects were outstanding. Better than Batman, by far.
9.0~What A Superhero! babypowder_321 Sign in Permalink I saw this yesterday (May 3rd, opening night) and I was completely blown away. I didn't expect this to be a good movie at all, oh, this is a stupid overblown hit-and-miss. Boy was I wrong! Tobey Maguire plays the part of nerdy Peter Parker so eloquently, you actually can't tell the difference between the actor and character. Kirsten Dunst also acts extremely well as Mary Jane Watson, Peter's love interest. If typecasting is a crime, then Stephen Raimi should be sent straight to jail. Everyone plays their part very well. **SPOILERS** However, the diologue is very comic-book-like, (i.e. dramatic, over the top) especially when Peter talks to Mary Jane about Spiderman looking into M.J.'s eyes, you just want to shield YOUR eyes, it's so cheesy. In fact, that's what I did. Also, the plot is kind of trite, I mean, Mary Jane nearly gets killed 3 times yet she still has a sunny outlook on things. The special effects are awesome, and if you see Spiderman in a theater with DTS, when Norman Osborn is talking to his evil alter ego, the whispering is very lifelike. Also, when Norman is experiencing a flashback from a murder he doesn't remember commiting, in the theater, one person screamed out loud! I strongly recommend you view this masterpiece!
8.0~Superb!!! rschwieb Sign in Permalink I've just gotten back from the movie theater, and after careful rumination it's definitely a 10! This movie brought Spider-man to life and then some. His mythology was well played out, and costumes get an A+. The plot was great, and the non-traditional ending does not let you down. I went into the movie expecting it to be pretty good, but it really surpassed pretty good in my case. I'm really glad I saw it, and it's not impossible that I might go see it again in theaters, something I've only done for a movie once before :D
10.0~Kept me interested from beginning to end Barry-44 Sign in Permalink "Spider-Man" is my favorite movie to date. As a boy I dreamt of being Spiderman and watching this movie brought back the magic of entertainment with exceptional actors and filming and believable acting and story plot. Tobey Maguire is wonderful both as the awkward teenager and as Spiderman. Director Sam Raimi is brilliant and I applaud him loudly. I rate this movie extremely high and recommend it totally.
9.0~What more can I say ... AWESOME!!! CyR4X Sign in Permalink I really thought this film would turn out to be another Hollywood flop but I could not have been more wrong. I'm a huge fan of Sam Raimi's Evil Dead films and Spider-Man has only increased my interest in his work. I'm just hoping that the sequels continue in this fashion and as long as Sam Raimi is in the Directors chair I'm sure they will.
5.0~Amazing first half, boring second nicver Sign in Permalink The first half of the movie is truly amazing. Lots of great ideas, the original story is very well adapted. But half way through it, the story gets so dumb you want to find who ever wrote the script and web him to silent forever. Too much blah blah in the second half, and besides Willem Dafoe, none of the actors really give a good performance. In this second half, there is too much disparity between the family scenes and the action scenes. And even the action scenes, besides perhaps the last one, are just plain dumb and stupid. I could not wait for this to be over.
4.0~nice try william_blake Sign in Permalink i couldn't be called a 'fan' of spider-man, but i've read my share of the comics when i was a kid. the movie certainly followed the early phases of spidey to the letter, but it still failed to really entertain me. or maybe because. tobey maguire is a great talented actor, but didn't appear (to me) as anywhere near peter parker the comic character. same goes to willem dafoe and james franco...however all of them did a good job. willem dafoe's mirror scene is outstanding. the best performance i saw was kirsten dunst as mary jane. too bad her role was mainly to scream while hanging on rooftops. there was some interesting dialogue, between mary jane and peter parker especially, but mainly the dialogue was trash, example being peter quoting his uncle in the most cheesy way possible. i didn't like the city scenes where spider-man moves from building to building, the computer animation is just too visible and tacky (in todays standards). green goblin was never my 'favorite' bad guy when i was reading these comics, the movie goblin actually seemed better to me. some of the fighting scenes are good stuff to watch even if you wouldn't like spider-man. infact, the fight scenes and mr. osborn's mental scenes were surprisingly brutal, i thought this was mainly a kid movie. the music of the movie was simply irritating hollywood orchestral thing. in the part of unexpected darkness, better than i expected, but still another superhero boom time creation. everybody wants to make a superhero movie now, hopefully we get a decent one one day, too. this one goes to the short list of the 'nice try's' (this is a good thing) along with tim burton's 'batman returns'. looking forward to seeing what daredevil is made of. at least then i get to see one of my favorite actors colin farrell playing one of my twisted childhood's hero figures, BULLSEYE :)
4.0~Maybe if this movie were bitten by a radioactive spider, it wouldn't suck so bad. Strangeworth Sign in Permalink Sure, it IS Spiderman. The thing is, it is very slow and many of the film's versions of the events and characters are a let down. Let's start with the most obvious, the Green Goblin. I was waiting for him to jump at someone and say "Arrgh!!!! My face doesn't move!" The multiple personality thing is cute, but in the comic he was rarely aware of his "Goblin" side's presence. At least not to the point of being able to talk to himself. Next, why did they not even bother putting Gwen Stacy in? I loved the Gwen Stacy concept. She died, proving he can't save everyone, not even the woman he loves. Spiderman himself was also a disappointment. He wasn't as sarcastic as his comic book counterpart. He complains too much about the price of being a super hero while this price is hardly ever shown. If you really want to see the price of a super hero, go check out this movie's sequel. Leave this one alone.
9.0~Right Up There With the Original Batman MissCzarChasm Sign in Permalink It's Finally here folks. Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man has hit the big screen. The hysteria surrounding this movie is out of this world. I saw the last showing of it with my friends because every other showing was sold out and the showing i saw was packed and filled with Spidey fans and excited movie goers alike.*POTENTIAL SPOILER* I just read this morning that Spider-Man achieved the highest opening day of all time with 41.5 million and is set to make about 100-120 million opening weekend which would make it surpass Harry Potter as the highest opening weekend of all time. *END SPOILER*. There is no doubt in my mind that this film deserves the praise it got from critics and from the reaction in my theatre this film is headed for the record books. Spider-Man is a comic book movie with heart. Yes i enjoyed Blade, another marvel adaptation, and I even enjoyed its sequel. I happened to like X-Men as well. But the one thing those movies lacked was a grounded hero which was given a firm backstory. While certain things were glanced over in those films, this picture takes time to develop its characters and by the time we reach the 45 minute mark we care about all their fates. There is a nice family storyline with Aunt May, Uncle Ben, and Peter Parker. There is romance with the Peter Parker/Mary Jane relationship, and there are also family struggles with the Norman/Harry Relationship. The story takes time to develop these stories and you can since that when this script was written it was done with a lot of heart and someone who cared about making us care about the characters and their struggles. One must talk about Tobey Maguire. I was disappointed when i first heard he got the part. I didn't think he could be tough enough considering his other starring roles. I was pleasantly surprised however when i saw his performance. He brings the comic book character to life in the best way. He induces the character with enough vulnerability in the beginning when he's a nerd that we care for him, but when he discovers he has powers Maguire easily shifts into someone more confident. He balances both personna's well, without falling out of character. Considering that we can't see his face at all when the mask is on, the fact that he still can give a masked character some heart is amazing in my book Kirsten Dunst isn't just there for eye candy, as the trailer would suggest. Sure, there are several shots of her that plenty of males will enjoy but she also brings her character from the comic book into the real world. Her chemistry with Tobey Maguire is not forced but very natural. There are certain moments when she falls into total damsel in distress mode but over-all it's a pretty grounded performance. James Franco makes for a very good Harry Osborn. He brings the character's struggles from the comic book and right onto the screen. We respect him because he's Parker's only friend but at the same time he makes you feel for him because he could end up as his father. Franco is able to this well and is very impressive in a few emotional scenes. Every comic book movie needs a good villian. Batman had the joker. X-men had Magneto and the Brotherhood of Evil Muntants. Spider-Man's greatest foe in the comic was none other than the Green Goblin. He gave Spider-Man the most conflict in the comic book because of the secret that he knew about Spider-Man and the secret that Spider-Man would eventually learn about him. It was very important that they not ruin this character because he's such an important villian in the Spider-Man mythology. I'm proud to say that Willem Dafoe is quite good as both Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. He makes his Norman likable yet flawed in the beginning but once he turns into the Green Goblin, that's when the fun starts. His performances is borderline over the top but since it never crosses the line he makes the villian much more threatening. You can tell he had fun with the part and while he doesn't quite reach the level of Jack Nicholson as the Joker, he's right up there as one of the better comic book movie villians. What i also enjoyed was the fact that the villian never over-shadowed the hero. This is where Batman made its mistake. Jack Nicholson stole the show, but since Dafoe doesn't get as much screentime as Tobey Maguire, he doesn't steal show. I'm glad the filmmakers chose to do this. The CGI is a wonder to look at it. You will believe that a man can stick to roles and soar over the city with grace. It's like a comic book come to life. There are some shots that look pretty unrealistic but when you think about it i think they were going for that in a couple of shots. It feels more like comic book when you see certain shots like that. Besides it would be very difficult to make this believeable with the use of a lot of CGI. The characters never lose their depth when they're in costume and the voice over work done when it's obviously not a man but a special effect is quite good as well. The actors deserves major kudos for making their characters believeable, even when it's a CGI shot. Sam Raimi is a gifted director. From genre films like the Evil Dead series, to compelling films such as A Simple Plan and The Gift, his work never ceases to amaze me. He handles the material well and you can tell he followed the comic book closely. He makes Spider-Man move much like he does in the comic book and he makes sure that there is more time spent on developing an actual story than giving us a lot of action. There is plenty of action, don't get me wrong but the story in my opinion is it's greatest highlight because you can almost identify with all of the characters. This credit should go to screenwriter, David Koepp, who also did well with the Panic Room script. Raimi does offer some campy touches. The wrestling match features a cameo with Bruce Campbell as the announcer, you may remember him as Ash from the Evil Dead movies, The towns reaction to Spider-Man is very campy and cheesy but is handled well. You can tell Raimi really had fun with the material. The J Jonah Jameson character is another example. Out of most of the supporting characters he looks more like his comic book character. The performance is doen pretty well and he does offer us some nice campy laughs. Spider-Man is more than a summer movie. Most summer movies supply you with much action but a little of everything else. This movie has it all. Action, romance, and a little heart too. The film leaves it wide open for a sequel and by the end of it i couldn't wait to go on another adventure with THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN!
8.0~Lots of fun! Nyghtewynd Sign in Permalink This was not exactly War and Peace, but it's a very entertaining movie. The main character was well-developed, which is important for those of us who don't inhale comics. I know there are a lot of people who complain about the differences between the movie and the original story, but come on, people, it's not 1950 any more. Stuff had to change. The effects were very good--the exact balance between cartoonish and realistic that needed to happen. My one disagreement with this movie was with Kirsten Dunst...for some reason, I thought she aged way, way, WAY too fast. While Peter Parker seemed to look about the same age, Dunst's character seemed to age about 20 years in the course of the movie. I understand that the plot covered a certain amount of time, but I didn't think it was that much. Oh, well...not a big problem for such an entertaining movie. Worth seeing, especially if it's gotten to your local dollar theater by now.
1.0~The perfect example of Hollywood... Decinian Sign in Permalink Money. This is all Hollywood stands for, and all it really cares about. Spider-Man's main goals: 1. Money 2. Money. and 3. Money. I saw this movie on it's opening weekend, and left the movie theater with a bad migraine, and several regrets. I could not comprehend what people found so great about this movie. Yeah it had some good action sequences, and some fancy camera angels ( which was the main cause of my migraine ), but aside from that nothing special. The acting is simply the actors reading off of que cards, and occasionaly smiling. Despite the fact that Kirsten and Toby did go out during this film there was no chemistry between them at all ( nor anyone else for that matter ). The plot is just plane unoriginal, and moronic. "Uh oh my uncle died well I better go become a superhero, and save the world." However it is not the movie I hate so much, but rather everything surronding the movie. The hundreds of hours of advertising, the thousands of stupid toys, the fact that the companys had to slap Spider-Man's face on every coke bottle, candy bar, and happy meal. If you have read my other reveiws you can tell I'm not too partial nor fond of Hollywood, which may or may not "blind" my judgement. Perhaps I have been a little too harsh. The movie itself is entertaining, and you can easily sit through it many times over. William Defoe ( I know that is misspelled ) is great, as always. Only he could act his way through the Green Goblin mask. However I do not look at movies as just things to watch when I'm bored, I think of movies as contempary paintings, and the directors artisits. That's why I did not like this movie, it had no real objective rather then $. Over all it merits about 5 out of 10.
7.0~Superb adaptation of the comic book hero, a few dodgy effects, but still good. Rich B Sign in Permalink A very cool film, encompassing humour, the darkness of the original superhero comics, and some slick action. It's a good story and a very good treatment, although the special effects aren't convincing in earlier scenes, and there are at least five boom shots that caught my eye. Apart from that it is a really good film. The story is entertaining and enjoyable, gripping you for the latter part.
8.0~Entertaining. mjurado Sign in Permalink I was one of those kids who grew up in the 80's watching the spider-man cartoon show and reading the comic books. I guess you could call me a 'fanboy'. Anyway, here's what I think of the film. The movie covers the origin of Spidey, fairly faithfully to the comic books. It was a little odd in some places, to see computers and other high-tech equipment in the scenery for things that happened in the comics in the 1960's. So, the film is set in the present day, presumably to hold the interest of a decidely younger audience. *mild spoilers* The story is the classic Spider-man tale. The lonely high school student, a little brainy for his own good and with a hopeless crush on the prettiest girl in school, is bitten by a radioactive spider. As a result, he is endowed with superhuman powers, the ability to climb walls, the proportionate strength and angility of a spider, and the trademark web-shooting. (in the comics, the web-shooters were a batman-esque tool he wore around his wrists, and har to be refilled with web cartriges sometimes; the web didn't just shoot out of his arm as it does in the film.) Even relatively minor characters, such as J. Jonah Jamison, the newspaper magnate who creates his own news, are faithfully represented and bring a familiar smile to the face of fans of the original books. The story is the tried and true comic book concept. The hero has a nemesis, whom he endeavors to protect the innocent from, and in the end he conquers his for and saves the girl. The film is entertaining, if a bit predictable and campy at times. The effects are nice, though occasionaly look too 'animated'. But, obviously this is a fantasy film, and one needs to suspend reality a bit. Overall, it's entertaining, and if you think you would enjoy the film I'll wager that you will. It's entertaining, very clean by today's standards, and has a couple of good laughs. Nothing really new or inventive, but a good time. 7 out of 10 stars.
10.0~One of the Bests! sixersgurl91 Sign in Permalink This movie is awesome, and I think has a lot of awards in it's future. This movie had good acting, a good plot and a good script. Maguire and Dunst did really good together, and I also have to say the special effects were spectacular. For going from a comic to a cartoon to a big-screen movie, Spider-Man was awesome! I give this movie a complete 10/10!
8.0~Entertaining; great acting by Toby McGuire; something missing chord97 Sign in Permalink As a long time Spiderman fan, I finally saw the movie last night. I found myself enjoying the movie as vignettes rather than a movie that really 'takes you there'. Something was missing...perhaps a more profound epiphany as the spider and human DNA combine...I rare forgot I was watching a movie (the fact that the movie stopped 3 times with the lights coming up didn't exactly help!). Toby McGuire is excellent as Spiderman...I hope there is an even BETTER sequel coming!
9.0~More Fun, Less Cynicism mstein128 Sign in Permalink The movie was purely good fun. Sure, it can be hokey, but all Superhero flicks are to some extent. As for the effects, how realistic can a man in blue tights swinging on skyscrapers look? I thought the effects added to the story, which was strong enough with the tension that is formed from his birth as "The Human Spider". It's not meant to be taken seriously (kinda obvious since it doesn't take itself too seriously, as Batman successfully did...which is a rarity). And all I have to say is...successful cameo by Macho Man Randy Savage? Ok...now it has to be given credit.
10.0~submerges and enwraps you into the movie; you want to be spider-man. daner4ten Sign in Permalink the first time i viewed this movie, it was the most spectacular movie i had seen. The warm and sensitive peter parker who was played by tobey maguire totally enwraps you. with the gentle use of superb character development and wise use of emotions, the action thriller becomes a drama. the only mistake made in the movie was the pointed metal holloween costume of the green goblin. also, i felt that tobey could have portrayed better body language of spiderman, he didnt move quite right. over all a very well thought movie and great acting done by tobey. it does justice to the comic and also contains some new and imaginative material. despite all the pressure on tobey to deliver, he pulled through marvellously better than any other actor i can think of to fill the role.
10.0~"Does Whatever a Spider Can", A spider can do Awesome! slimjim69 Sign in Permalink This movie is outstanding, I saw it the first time, on the first day. I love it then. I have gone and seen it 5 times already. I can't get enough, I love the acting, the storyline, everything. Except they did change up some of Spider-Man's powers, but I enjoy it a lot. I have seen over 2000 movies so far, and this could very well be my favorite. 10 out of 10 Stars!!!!!
8.0~Perfect Comic Book film. Delivers expectations. insomniac_rod Sign in Permalink I'm not a big fan of Comic book brought to the big screen but I enjoyed "Spider-Man" because it delivers the elements that people expect from these movies: a likable hero, evil villains, spectacular f/x and a hot female character. "Spider-Man" set a new standard for these kind of movies (that would later be renewed by "Batman Begins") and it paved the road for many of them. The fact that Sam Raimi is the Director makes me really proud because I'm a huge fan of his previous work. So if you combine such a talented Director like him and the new goods of mainstream Cinema, the result is amazing. Sadly, this movie isn't for everyone and I don't appreciate at it's full potential because I'm not a fan boy but still this delivers expectations. I watched it on the theaters and I had a really good time.
10.0~One word: Amazing villanuevagiancarlo Sign in Permalink Something inside of me still wishes that there will one day be a Spider-Man 4. This is the film that started it all, and tells a perfect faithful comic book adaption of Peter's origin story of what made him Spider-Man. I'm a huge sucker for an origin story and this film is pretty much a flawless example. This is how a superhero film SHOULD be made, this film means something to me and will always amaze me even if I were to view it for the 100th time. If I'm being honest, this movie is one of my all time favorites. The characters were perfectly brought to the big screen, the action still is refreshing and well executed, and lots of other reasons. I highly recommend this film if you haven't seen it, you won't be disappointed. 10/10
9.0~Nice Cameos in a Great Movie caamich Sign in Permalink I got a lot more emotional spectrum out of this movie than I expected. That alone impressed me. I felt sorrow, glee, anger, fear, humor, and even shocked enough to jump at one point. There were some great cameos (one of which I missed, darnit!) by former cohorts of Sam Raimi's from his Xena and Hercules days. Some were more obvious than others, which explains why I missed the one person I would have really liked to see. Anyway, I'm told by my comic-fan friends that this movie did a really good job of honoring those who told the tale of Spiderman before it. I wouldn't know--I was more of an Archie, Pink Panther, Peanuts sort of kid. All I know is, even without being a comic fan, I really enjoyed the movie. It's always a plus when a film works on all your emotional strings. Oh, and did I mention how good the special effects were? SEAMLESS.
7.0~It was good, but.... KADurham Sign in Permalink I would like to start out by saying that I am a BIG-time Spider-Man comic book fan. I have collected and read every issue he has appeared in. However, other than the characters themselves, this review is not about the comic book, but the movie. ***By the way, possible spoilers ahead*** Starting with the characters, I believe Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker was excellent and portrayed the true Peter Parker perfectly. Also, the Norman and Harry Osborn characters were well written and acted. However, the best character of the movie was by far J Jonah Jameson. The movie was worth the price of admission alone to see the scenes with him in it. The problem I had was with how Mary Jane Watson was depicted. She is not the shy, damsel-in-distress, oh woe-is-me character that was shown in the movie. She is a fiery young lady to match her Red hair who is full of spunk and gusto. She is brash and outspoken and wild and fun and at this point in her life she is a little self-centered and aloof. They missed the boat completely with her character....but a true Spider-Man comic fan can look past that, because this should be about a stand-alone movie and not the comic. So what about the movie. It started out with great emotion, which is what a movie (any type, but especially and action movie) should bring out. A wry smile and a quiet cheer came up as the geek boy beat on the school bully. Tears were shed at the passing of Uncle Ben. There was a lump in the throat and a quickened pulse during the first fight scene with the Green Goblin. But....for all the emotion that came about throughout most of the movie, there was absolutely none for the final fight scene. This is where the problem was in the movie. There needed to be web and flows, back and forth, hero is down, hero is up, hero is back down and out, hero finds a way, everybody cheers. Instead we got a one-sided fight for the villain for a few minutes, than a one-sided fight for the hero, and then it was over. The way the final battle ultimately ended was very anti-climatic and, I might add, stolen straight out of the comic book, which also made it very predictable and very disappointing. And I haven't even mentioned the final scene yet, which was very sappy, extremely out of place, and seemed forced upon us almost as if they had to hurry up and finish the movie before they could figure out how to properly end it. I gave this movie a 7 as the 3 for the last 1/4 was offset by the 10 for the first 3/4. It's still worth seeing, but for all the hype, and for such a promising beginning, be prepared to be disappointed somewhat when you walk out of the theater.
7.0~Superman for todays crowd oneloveall Sign in Permalink Delivering nearly all the blockbuster potential it held, Spider-Man burst onto the public consciousness in 2002, surpassing even the most generous sales expectation to become one of modern cinemas highest grossing films. Basically a catalyst behind the never ending glut of comic book franchises today, the movie proved to be an extremely agreeable update of essentially the same qualities which made Superman just as endearing in the old days. Borrowing a little heavily from that prototype, as is the original Stan Lee based comic, lies the same geeky alter ego who works at a newspaper while pursuing crime and the girl he loves in secret. Nothing really strays too far from that quintessential superhero lore, but if anything, puts it all in one very entertaining and accessible package for all shapes and sizes to enjoy. Part of the winning strategy behind this success story was the smart idea of putting veteran gore hound Sam Raimi on the case. Raimi was a fixture with 80's cult horror, providing the wonderfully crazed Evil Dead series amongst other demented fare. Having graduated with flying colors from the clutches of low budget horror, Raimi went on to direct more standard Hollywood fare, but it was the great stroke of casting him as director of this franchise that really made him a household name to middle America. Whoever knew that Raimi would be the right man for the job must have known what they were doing, for there was hardly a hint he would be capable of sustaining this kid-friendly, adult-entertaining film while retaining the integrity of the original comic books which it's based upon, though after a few frames of this easy to swallow comic adventure it becomes clear he was ideal. Raimi walks a fine line between Marvel geekdom and general audience appeasement, crafting a balanced piece of work that should appeal to a surprisingly large and varied demographic. The action is intense but bloodless, conveying the painful struggles Spider-Man endures facing his enemies, but never making the violence mean spirited so a younger crowd may enjoy as well. The much touted CGI effects still retain a wondrous sense of physicality five years later, articulating the most romanticized superhero homage since the original man of steel whenever the camera takes flight with Peter Parker. Spidey himself could not have been better cast; Tobey Maguire silenced nearly all critics with his powerfully introverted but accessible performance, filling out plenty of shiny sequences with a greater sense of depth then the genre usually provides. J.K. Simmons offers some wonderfully crafted comic relief in a brief supporting role, but Willem Dafoe oversteps a cartoonish boundary when portraying murderous alter-ego Green Goblin. All in all, a triumphant accomplishment for this team, worthy of the big interest it initially received due to Raimi's winning approach. Spider-Man still suffers from many of your typical Hollywood clichés, especially if one still holds the fossilized Superman franchise in high regard, but there seems to be enough passion coming from nearly all involved to take the crown as current champ of superhero productions.
10.0~No complaints here. joeking79 Sign in Permalink This is the first movie that I have watched and had not one complaint afterwards. Great pacing, acting and special effects will make this one a classic in the years to come. Tobey Maguire truly brings to life the role of Peter Parker. I can't wait for the sequel.
5.0~exciting, but not enough fun.... macenblu Sign in Permalink after waiting so long for this movie, i went in with mixed expectations...firstly, i was annoyed at spidey's costume: since when was the webbing made out of shiny metallic piping? i guess since the CG guys decided it would look "cooler" seeing flames and explosions reflect off of that webbing....personally, i think that always makes things seem more fake (see Episode I for proof)..and what was with the 'green goblin'? wasnt he once a goblin, not a businessman with bipolar disease?... secondly, the dialogue and script couldnt have been worse...i found myself laughing out loud at some of the scenes (especially the corny hospital dialogue) my biggest problem? I remember reading spidey comics as a kid, and they were always so much fun...spidey was always bantering with the super villains, making wise cracks....that is what made the comics fun, and this movie didnt have enough of that...it seemed like Raime was trying to create too dark a spidey, brooding and toubled...Tim Burton pulled it off beautifully with Batman, but spidey is a different beast.... all that aside, the action was very cool, and the effects were interesting.. this movie should have been more campy, sardonic, and alot more fun...hopefully, they'll do better in the sequel...and we had better see the Black Cat!
7.0~Good first effort ijtfalcon Sign in Permalink I must say, when I first saw this movie I thought it was absolutely fantastic. Maybe it was simply because I had been anticipating watching it for so incredibly long that in a first viewing, it could do no wrong. I liked it so much, in fact, that I went and saw it again the very next day. Since that first viewing, and with the added fact that I immediately bought it when it arrived on DVD, I have finally started seeing the cracks. I think the long and the short of the movie's faults lay in its screenplay, which leaves a person wanting. Aside from some some pretty weak dialogue and a climactic scene which mirrors a similar scene in Batman Forever, this is still a pretty good movie. See this if only to give you the ground work to see the sequel which is vastly superior. Let's hope number 3 follows suit.
8.0~Really entertaining... Rock1984 Sign in Permalink I really liked this movie. The action is good, the actors are good, the beginning is funny, the special effects are good. I don't know what else to say about the good sides of this movie. I weren't into the Spiderman comics before, so I cannot comment on how much Raimi left off from the original. But I liked it, and as it is often it's harder for me to put a finger on what I liked that on what I didn't like. And there were some things that I didn't like. Some of the costumes looked as if they came right out of a Power Rangers episode. Some animations of Spiderman looked extremely fake and computer generated. The last few minutes (I don't mean the scene on the cemetery but the last fight) were a bit boring, and in the second half of the movie it somehow lost its humor. Again this sounds as if this would be just a mediocre movie, but it isn't. It's really good. Go and watch it :). 8/10
10.0~One of the best films based on a comic I've seen Rogue-32 Sign in Permalink This film is fun, plain and simple. It manages to achieve the perfect balance of portraying the serious aspects of being a super hero (the "with great power comes great responsibility" byline) and the sheer glee of suddenly finding yourself embued with said powers (AND the rapt attention of the girl you've loved since your childhood). Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and Willem DaFoe (get it? DaFoe??! DA FOE!!?) were all superb as well. Maguire always manages to hit the perfect human tone in his performances, making him sympathetic and believable. Kirsten...she just has to show up, and of course DaFoe was MORE than capable as the evil and disgusting Green Goblin. The long, detailed set-up was so well rendered that when the first action sequence took place, it seemed like an extra treat, the icing on the cake. In so many of these sort of films, the stuff between the action sequences drones on and on in an artlessly contrived fashion, but in Spider-Man it was the opposite. Kudos to Raimi and the entire production team for (forgive me) weaving the perfect web.
10.0~Woooooo-hoooooo!!! whizkids Sign in Permalink This is such an awesome ride! I have been waiting two years to see this movie, and I have finally seen it! This is great, just absolutely great! Tobey Maguire did a fantastic job as Peter Parker. I'm something like Peter before he got bit, so I could kinda relate to him. The way they re-wrote it more according to the new Ultimate Spider-man comics vs. the old classic way that Spider-man got his powers was marvelous. The action scenes were great. The only part about this movie that was a little hard to bear was the goblin costume. But, he was insane, so it didn't really cut away from his character. Back to the action, PULSE-POUNDING! Spider-man winding up fighting the goblin so many times was great. The hand-to-hand combat was superbly done. The CG battles were expert, and just everything oozed of greatness. As a long-time Spider-man fan, I'm very happy with this film, and so is my sister, who usually doesn't like him. Anyone who likes fun movies with plenty of thrills will not be disappointed by this blockbuster. Get caught in this web. You won't be sorry!
10.0~Watched more than 100times mory-m360-0-855735 Sign in Permalink Idk why the rate of this film is 7.3 its desreved more than 8 its best movie i ever seen from marvel
10.0~I loved the film it was great Hayden Christensens Gurl Sign in Permalink I loved the film it was great I loved Tobey Maguires acting in that movie He is so HOT! HOT! I hope that the the sequel is really good like the first film. I also liked the way Tobey and Kirsten acted together they looked really good together.
1.0~It tanked chelhy Sign in Permalink Quickly, this was ridiculous, absurd and moronic. A senseless waste of time film and money. Way too many plot flaws and really I didn't have the bar high at all. I wanted to like it and it was just too much to ask. How sad!
9.0~Great Movie birkin Sign in Permalink I finally had a chance to see the movie in theaters a couple days ago, and I must say I was impressed. Most movies that are adapted from video games or comic books end up being a flop. This wasn't a flop, it was probably the greatest comic book adaption of all time. The one thing I didn't like about it was the graphics, because it was simple CGI stuff, but other than that, this movie is definitely worth seeing.
3.0~Tobey Maguire just doesn't do it for me qck1 Sign in Permalink I know a lot of people loved Tobey Maguire in this film. He definitely ruins the film for me. Watching the film again I found that character he portrays is just unbelievable as a superhero. This could be the director. I also resent that he does not look like he has the physique does not look like the physique in the suit because the suit is a muscle suit. I would like the actor that plays Spiderman to look like he has the physique. I think that they should have found somebody that can portray a geek, but also look like a superhero when the body suit, like George Reeves or Christopher Reeve who had to play a similar character as Superman. If Superman can find an actor that can play both sides well, so should Spiderman. Then all I have to see to ruin the film for me is to see Tobey Maguire's smile. Hard for my to appreciate the rest of the film when I cannot stand the main actor (Iron Man is mostly successful for me because of Robert Downey Jr.).
8.0~Good Overall, But Has Some Notable Problems... Moviefan-Two-Kay-Four Sign in Permalink I've seen a great many films in my time, and most fade with the passage of time. It's been six years since this movie's release, and unlike most efforts, it still holds up very well. Tobey Maguire, previously seen at that time in the controversial "Pleasantville", gained worldwide attention when director Sam Raimi cast him in the title role. By contrast, Kirsten Dunst's portrayal of Mary Jane Watson was (and still is) widely debated among both critics and the fans. Personally, I enjoyed her role very much, and thought she did a wonderful job with both the empathy and strength of the character. So many heroines in films seem shallow, weak, or oversexed. Mary Jane is none of those, although one scene does push the third reference quite a bit (more on that later). James Franco, who went on to star as a military trainee in the drama "Annapolis", does a nearly-perfect job as Harry Osborn. The character has been taken through many trials in the comic world, from drug addiction to demon posession (thank God the filmmakers didn't use either of those!); as such, it takes a talented actor to fill those shoes, and Franco does it justice. Willem Dafoe, as both Harry's father Norman and the psychotic Green Goblin, gives one of the greatest performances of his career, playing both sides of the proverbial coin: a weak-willed, oppritunistic man bent on success, and a crazed, evil being who revels in death and destruction. But by far, my favorite role in this film is "Law & Order" star J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. He truly enjoys playing this character, and it shows on every conceivable level. As the saying goes, he truly "eats the scenery" in all his moments. Casting him was a stroke of pure genius. The effects in this film are truly wonderful, though in retrospect the two sequels have definitely improved them. Still, the costumes, colors, and heroics are all stylishly believable. The world of this film is recognizably ours, yet raised slightly, to mirror the fantastic tone of the comics. Explosions, web-swinging aerial photography, digital composites, practical stunts - all these and more keep this film at an often-frenetic and rarely dull pace. The music, composed by film legend Danny Elfman ("Beetlejuice", "Batman"), consists of everything from wondrous, gentle string arrangements to grand, epic stanzas, and Elfman works each one like the professional that he is. From the love theme for MJ and Peter, to the phenomenal main titles, the score is brilliant from start to finish. Lastly, my criticisms, few but important. Being a PG-13 film, you might expect certain films to push every conceivable boundary; "Spider-Man" is a welcome release, in that it aims for heroic, selfless integrity, and succeeds for the most part. Still, there exist a few moments of note. One such moment takes place during the thunderstorm rescue with Mary Jane Watson. During a series of shots, the rain has soaked her clothes entirely, and her shirt almost looks like it belongs to a "Wet T-shirt" contestant (Dunst's breasts and nipples are partially visible through the material). Given the situation (a cold, wet thunderstorm at night), her attire is understandable, though morally unacceptable. To Raimi's credit, the scenes are quickly edited and not extremely graphic, though I personally believe decency should have been a higher priority in this situation. Secondly, the violence. Being a superhero film, this movie fits that formula, having our wall-crawling avatar battle numerous thugs, as well as the Goblin. Citizens are often in peril (Mary Jane in particular), and though not bloody, many of the action sequences feature flying punches and kicks galore. The language in this film is thankfully kept to a minimum, with the most recurring instances being remarks such as "ass" or "hell". For such a film, I truly applaud Sam Raimi's effort at maintaining decency for most of this entry. This film gets an 8 out of 10, deducting two points for violence and sexual material. The nobility, respect, and (in most cases) upright morality are a welcome change of pace from the excessive swearing, explicit sex, and buckets of blood seen in many modern films.
4.0~Average, ordinary action movie. Not that great. asterix2112 Sign in Permalink I don't get it. How is this movie is so popular? It's not all that good, it's just an average, ordinary action movie. It's such a shame because I love the Spidey comics, but this movie does not due Spidey justice. First of all they watered down the whole story line, Gwen Stacy (and the tension of two girls) is gone. Harry's drug problems which caused such a furor by mot being approved by the comics code are left out, just to name two. What's left is a sacchrine love / action story. Second, it's just average and predictible. No different then any Swartzenager or Segal movie. Yeah, there are good scenes, and the action is fun. Tobey is good as Spidey, though Kirsten Dunst is not very good as Mary Jane. Dafoe is good, and it's nice to see someone from the great Freaks and Geeks show doing something (James Franco as Harry). Overall 2 1/2 stars at most. Wait to rent it on DVD, your not missing anything great.
2.0~No plot, too violent, and waste of Toby McQuire joshualieder Sign in Permalink I was excited to go and see this film. I dont get out to the movies that much anymore. I plunked down my 9 dollars and boy was I disappointed in this awful drek! Couldnt they have at least tried to have a plot?!! Every silly superhero story seems to have the same awful plot these days and they sacrifice an actual story to lame cgi. I didn't buy the way spidey spun about town at all and the Kirsten Dunst stuff was just plain pointless. For a brief moment it looked like the spidey and his uncle scene might actually go someplace and then we have the typical plot development (I wont give it away...but its easily guessed!). I like Toby Mcquire and have seen every single one of his films. He doesnt really do much acting in this movie and well...it just has no bite at all. I think Toby should go on to make better films like he was doing and squash this bug.
4.0~Is it as good as the hype? akcliu Sign in Permalink Spider-Man features some intense (even too violent for PG rated film) and amazing action sequences (sadly most of them were already showcased in the trailer). But the dialogue is awful, and the performance of Toby Maguire is dull and even at time annoying. Not that he didn't pull it off as an geeky teenager transform into a superhero, but really apart from being geeky person possessing superhuman power, he does not emote at all. Spider-man is not a bad movie, but it really isn't as great as what the box-office success reflects.
10.0~Well Worth The Wait!!! nyght5150 Sign in Permalink I grew up with Spiderman and have waited years and years for a great movie version of him to come along. I saw the movie on Saturday and was really impressed with it. The artistic licenses that they took (like the organic webbing and such) did not ruin the overall experience for me at all. I agree with what Stan Lee said on a radio interview on a local station to me --- they DID preserve the spirit of Spiderman!! And that is, after all, the main thing that we could hope for.
9.0~The first epic Marvel Film alindsay-al Sign in Permalink This Film was the first real blockbuster of this new comic book generation and the first Comic book film I ever saw. I believe this film has a bit of everything for the comic book fans and just the casual fans to enjoy. This film was especially appealing for me once I heard The Green Goblin was going to be in the film since he is my favourite villain in comic book history and I believe The Goblin was the perfect villain for this film and just added to the overall quality of the film. This film has great action and a narrative that really does make the character of peter parker relatable to the audience and add to the emotional parts of the film which just like the majority of the film. The only small negatives are such things as some slow parts and awkward dialogue portions between Mary Jane and Peter. But there is just too many positives to miss out on this film apart from what I mentioned and the relationship between Harry and Norman Osborne was a great addition to the love story. Overall a fantastic comic book film with just about a bit of everything positive for it.
9.0~A fun, exciting, energetic film! bethanymilankovic Sign in Permalink I think this is a great film and it tells a good story. It brings the famous Marvel character to life. It grabs your attention from the start and keeps you going all the way through. Even though it uses special effects they are not too obvious, making the film more realistic. The cast in this are amazing and play their roles very well especially Tobey Maguire who is really having to play two different people as he is showing two opposite sides to one person, he brings emotion and energy to this film and is the perfect person for the job; playing a nerdy teenager who doesn't particularly fit in at school and also playing a brave hero. This film is one that you can watch many times and still enjoy the story and action and is a great start to the next films that follow. It's a good film which is definitely worth watching!
9.0~Very well done TheDuke-2 Sign in Permalink It's refreshing to see quality film making done today. This was a very enjoyable movie, based on my favorite Super Hero. I've waiting over 8 years for this picture and now I get to enjoy it. The graphics are done wonderfully and look flawless as they blend in with the rest of the picture. This is not the "Busy" movie Star Wars episode 2 will be when you see it. The story is done well, and the performances are superb by both Toby Maguire (Spiderman) and William Dafoe (Goblin). Forget Ebert's comments and go see it, you'll enjoy it :)
9.0~great...but still not Batman Winggod3 Sign in Permalink Spider Man was a great movie, but it still doesn't wreak of the badass superhero attitude of Tim Burton's Batman. Nonetheless, this movie marked the first time since the Matrix came out in which I thoroughly enjoyed a movie from start to finish. I actually left the theatre still excited about it, dreaming of whatever sequel will come of it. The effects were great, but they weren't overly intrusive; there was still a movie going on at the same time as the effects. So many movies will more or less put the story on hold to squeeze in some worthless special effect, but Spider Man actually used the special effects to complement the story and not BE the story. It was also wonderfully written, like a direct animation from the Marvel pages themselves. I could almost feel myself turning the pages as the movie went from scene to scene. I rank this movie a 9...great, but not immortal. Its simply what every comicbook based movie SHOULD be.
10.0~One of the best live-action comic book adaptations EVER closeharlan Sign in Permalink What can I say? I saw the movie and liked it so much I HAD to see it again as soon as I could. And I did. Toby Maguire is awesome as Peter Parker. I had never seen his work before but I was so impressed, I have to. I was also worried that Kyrsten Dunst didn't have the chops to do a believable Mary Jane Watson. I was dead wrong. Not only was she incredibly good as an actor in the movie, she was excruciatingly hot, too (who didn't love her in the wet shirt?). The special effects made the action sequences some of the best I've ever seen. Any problems with the fx can be chalked up to the relatively primitive level of computer Graphics. One of the main reasons I loved this movie is that it has a comic book ending instead of a Hollywood ending. Peter Parker could have the girl of his dreams but instead of just grabbing for her, he decides that he does not want her to be placed at risk again as a consequence of what he does as an extracurricular activity. The ending was gutsy and true to the kind of life a man like Peter Parker or Bruce Wayne would have to live.
9.0~Wow! joharitaylor Sign in Permalink after being an avid reader/collector of the spider-man comic series for 15 years, i was desperately hoping not to be disappointed when production of the movie was announced, thankfully i wasnt, quite the opposite in fact! tobey maguire as peter parker was an inspired choice! after seeing him in movies like cider house rules, pleasantville and wonder boys, i knew he'd be the perfect peter. kirsten dunst(my fav actress) is again excellent although she doesnt look like the mj i had always pictured, but this is was never a problem for me. the rest of the cast ranges from solid to excellent. the story is excellent, lively and humourous - exactly what one comes to expect from a spidey yarn. although some lines come offas corny, remember this is a comic book movie, not schindlers list(another excellent movie). overall i gave this movie a solid 9 out of 10, and ranks in my top5 movies of 2002, just behind minority report and the LOTR: The Two Towers.
8.0~Not since Superman has a comic book film had this much impact. theshadow908 Sign in Permalink Spider-Man, based off the Marvel comic book, tells the story of geeky high school student Peter Parker, who is bitten by a genetically altered spider, and wakes up the next morning with amazing new powers. At first he attempts to use these powers for personal gain. When a wrestling promoter screws him over, he lets a criminal rob him. Later, his Uncle Ben is shot and killed by the same man. He realizes that he can't let that happen to anybody ever again, so he becomes Spider-Man. Not long after, his first big threat arrives, the maniacal Green Goblin, who, unbeknownst to Peter, is the scientist father of his best friend. The reason Spider-Man was such a big hit is because it had the same epic potential as Superman. The fan base was huge to begin with, so hype for the movie was unequaled by anything else. The reason I liked it so much was because it followed a perfect superhero movie formula. Adequate time was spent on all the aspects of the story. The origin, the honing of his special powers, a few fights with petty criminals, the first fight with the villain, a small confrontation in between, and the final climatic battle. In between all of this is the personal drama. Sam Raimi was able to successfully tie all that in and make it work in the 2 hour time frame. He was able to show how Peter Parker's life changes when he becomes Spider-Man. Raimi set the world of Spider-Man in a realistic world. A lot of people didn't like the Green Goblin in this movie, stating he looked like a Power Rangers villain. I disagree. Norman Osborn created an armoured flight suit for soldiers to wear, so the armoured green suit was perfectly fine with me. Spider-Man is, in my books, the most accurate comic book movie out there, besides Sin City at least. Another thing some fans missed was Spider-Man's trademark wisecracks toward his enemies. While this is a part of his character, I thought it made him more serious. I mean, who can really think up that much stuff to say while deep in battle. Also, the situation isn't that funny, so why make jokes? What disappointed me most about the movie was the campy dialogue in some scenes. Some of the lines that come out of characters' mouths in this movie are way too cheesy. Also, the CGI is really underdeveloped. Other than that, this movie has nothing wrong with it. The acting is really good. I hated the idea of Tobey Maguire playing Spider-Man until I saw the movie. Now there's no one else. He really shocked me with how well he played the role. I didn't know he could be tough when he wanted to! Willem Dafoe is great as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. He plays the perfect bad guy, and plays a great nut case too. Overall, Spider-Man is a great comic book film, and if the dialogue was 100% cool throughout the movie and the CGI was flawless, it would get a 10 out of me. I recommend this movie to anyone that was ever remotely a fan of Spider-Man. 8/10
1.0~This overhyped comic-movie is just NOT GOOD. antimax Sign in Permalink Perhaps the most overhyped motion picture since INDEPENDENCE DAY, this movie does NOT deliver the goods. It takes a whole hour for the fun to begin and then the fun isn't so great. The effects look cheap and rushed considering the budget and the story drags along like a worthless snail. There is NO chemistry between the cast (WHO CAST THIS DAMN THING?!) and it is just one big disappointment. Go see DEUCES WILD instead.
10.0~Awesome! MotownMan Sign in Permalink This was the first movie in a long time that truly lived up to the hype generated by the trailers. While many of the best scenes were shown in the trailers, the action and adrenaline levels remained high throughout the film. It was PERFECTLY cast, as Tobey Maguire captured the essence of the nerdy high school kid who suddenly developed super powers. I especially enjoyed how the movie was mostly shot from his perspective, giving you a feeling about how his emotions and actions were governed by his feelings for his aunt and uncle as well as Mary Jane. Kirsten Dunst, by the way, is the IDEAL beautiful girl next door. While they could have easily cast an exotic actress (like Penelope Cruz or Liv Tyler), they seemed to hit the nail on the head with Dunst. Definitely the best superhero movie since the original Superman. I give it a 10!
10.0~sweet, action packed, and pulsating tlewis-3 Sign in Permalink Peter Parker is the Fox Mulder of the big screen (barring any re-occurences of that role by David Duchovny). A charecter that it's easy to root for. Spiderman is more imaginable for the rest of us than Batman or Superman, because amazingly with today's genetics experiments...and technology, we could actually fall prey to something sointriguing (atleast in my fantasy world). Tobey Maguire easily makes to character loveable, and the film is filmed with enough romance, action and beautiful blue eyes, to keep you wanting more. Can't wait for the sequel 2004.
10.0~Awesome jenty02 Sign in Permalink I loved this movie, I really never liked "Spider-man" as a kid but I watched this movie and I was shocked. My boyfriend was trying to tell me I need to see it and so I did with him and it was really good... I work at a movie theater so I must have watched about ten times... I think it is a really cool kids movie and it has all around fun for everyone...
1.0~Congratulations, Mr. Raimi and Tristar... you've made the WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!! SSJAniFan Sign in Permalink Okay, to be honest, I am a big Spider-man fan. I'd grab all of the comics, watch the cartoon on Saturdays, buy the toys..... heck, I even stuck through the clone mess, the reboot nightmare, and worst of all, Paul Jenkins's Peter Parker Spider-man #21(at least he got better at writing Spidey stories). But after the decision to cast Kirsten Dunst, an actress I detest with all my heart, as Mary Jane Watson, and seeing the stupid costume they designed for the Green Goblin(which, in the song "Ode to A Superhero," Weird Al Yankovic named it the equivalent of a Power Rangers costume), I had my doubts. A lot of doubts. This didn't help when I saw the teaser(Let's go for the Ultimate Spin? Kill me now). But still, after the opening weekend, I reluctantly decided to see it, hoping that it would be good and I'd be wrong, since I did like the comic adaption(but then again, it was written by Stan Lee, a person who can actually WRITE). And so, I went inside the movie theater. Sadly, my hopeful expectations were shot as fatally as poor Uncle Ben. The film, simply put, is HORRIBLE. The acting is some of the worst I have ever seen in my life. The opening scene at the science lab was so bad, I wanted to vomit. By the time Peter is figuring out his powers, I actually couldn't take any more and tried to leave the movie theater, but one of my friends forced me to stay. Spider-man's character is also downplayed. We only have the serious wall-crawler from some of Stan Lee's more serious issues, but we never get to see the lighter side. Spider-man doesn't even make one of his trademark wisecracks that we all know and love the entire film(something pivotal to the character. Just read the story, "The Best Medicine," in PPSM#20, and you'll see what I mean). This humorless character pretty much just spends the entire time complaining. Add to the fact that there is NO chemistry between Peter/Spidey and MJ in the film, and you have another reason to hate this. SPOILERS IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH Right after the wrestling scene, when the guy hands Peter his money, we see that Peter ISN'T wearing that shoddy face-mask from earlier. So doesn't this guy know that he's Spider-man? I mean, Peter shows up and beats up the wrestler with his SPIDER powers, and now some guy dressed in a red and blue costume calling himself Spider-man shows up? This guy could find out who he is now, unless he's too stupid to make the obvious connection! All he has to do is learn his name.... oh, but if Peter goes on and sells photos to the Daily Bugle, wouldn't it have a "photos taken by Peter Parker," or something like that? This plot hole just serves to show how little the writers were thinking when they created this nightmare. Also, Aunt May's "Superman," line is so awful it shows how low some script-writers can get when they try to inject some humor. END SPOILERS Danny Elfman once again creates a forgettable score, similar to Hulk,(this is the guy who once composed stuff for Simpsons, Batman, and Men In Black!?), which doesn't really affect the mood of the film. And the CGI is just plain bad. It is so obvious whenever you see a CGI Spider-man instead of Tobey Maguire. Raimi really needs to work here if he wants to clean up this mess in time for the sequel.... but I doubt he will. BOTTOM LINE: The ultimate piece of trash. Someone needs to boycott the sequel.
8.0~Well put together playing of the Marvel comic book character... dwpollar Sign in Permalink 1st watched 1/12/2003 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Sam Raimi): Well put together playing of the Marvel comic book character and his beginnings by Director Raimi. He made some very good choices in casting including the humble Tobey McGuire as soft-spoken Peter Parker(aka. Spider-man) , and Willem Dafoe as the nemesis Green Goblin. As someone who was familiar with the original story it was good to see them not overdo it for the screen and pretty much followed the line of the original comic book. The special effects throughout the film was great with almost a video game feel when spider-man flies through the city. The decision to make the Goblin almost like a Mighty Morphin Power Ranger-like villain is probably the weakest element of the film but this doesn't detract from the appeal of the film overall. There is also a very well-done on-again off-again romantic element added with Parker, his best friend, Spider-man and the Kirsten Dunst character(kind of a 3 on 1 thing). There is some very good dialogue spotted throughout the movie which also keeps you grinning and an obvious lead-in to a sequel is thrown in at the end(which is good for us fans.). And of course who can forget the TV theme song to end the film which was a nice added touch tying in another media and it's rendition of the source.
10.0~Spectacular story-telling...Not What I expected! KBean5588 Sign in Permalink When I walked into the theatre to see Spider-Man, I was thinking that this was going to be a movie for the "children" and that I wouldnt be interested in it....I Was defintely wrong. It was a perfect film for almost everyone. It has comedy, drama, romance, and suspense. I do admit the acting could have been better but they were all young and I respect that. They will improve. But that really didnt affect the entire impact the film had on me and the audience. It was an awesome film that I will probably go to see again. I now know why it grossed a record 114 Million Dollars in its first three days. I loved it.
10.0~WOW! cdipatri Sign in Permalink WOW! I mean freakin' WOW! It's not very often I pay twice to see a movie in the theater (or know for sure I'll buy the DVD on the day it's released), but I have to tell you, Spider-Man was just about the best, most fun movie I've seen in a long time. The film is just about 2 hours that feels like 15 minutes. It's full of action, has a great plot, some good gushy scenes for the sentimental, and an outstanding performance by the entire cast. Tobey Maguire plays the webbed wonder and does a great job. I wasn't a big fan of his, but I am now. My daughters also have a new heartthrob. For the guys, Kirsten Dunst is beautiful and puts on a great performance. The most outstanding (and I mean Oscar quality) performance has to go to Willem Dafoe. He portrays the Green Goblin and is so creepy, he made my blood run cold a few times. He literally steals every scene he's in. For those who remember the 60's cartoon series will get a huge kick out of J. Jonah Jameson. J.K Simmons plays him just like the cartoon. If you're a Spidey fan like me or you have kids that like super heroes, you have to go see this movie. It was loads of fun and has to be seen in the theater.
1.0~Yep, it's a COMIC book movie alright. bradgodhra Sign in Permalink I must say, after seeing Spider-Man at a preview show tonight, I was really excited; the thought of having X-Men, Batman, and even Jason coming back from comics to movies was exciting, but my favorite of all time has and always will be, Spider-Man. However, I WAS DISAPPOINTED! Sure, it had great effects and great dialogue, I especially like the Superman comment Aunt May made, but the story and plot line is very very dull, especially if you already know the Green Goblin storyline from the comic books and the cartoons. Also, where are the other villains? Where's Venom, Dr. Octopus, Hobgoblin, The Jackyl, and Electro? Hell, bring in Mystero, they have better storylines then The Green Goblin. Another thing that I have noticed, Kristen Dunst does NOT play a good Mary Jane-Watson; I'm sorry, she sucked in Bring it on, she sucks in Spider-Man. Tobey Maguire plays a good early edition of Spider-Man, but I think they should pass the torch on to someone less dorky; I mean sure, Spider-Man was a dork in the comics for the early years of spider-man, but if you're a fan of Spider-Man you will know he becomes way cooler in the later years. And why did they bring Macho Man Randy Savage in the picture? An old washed up wrestler in a high anticipated movie? Oh wait, I forgot about The Scorpion King coming out too. *SPOILERS* I just really hate this movie, this is a disgrace to the Spider-Man name, comics, and the fans; any fan of Spider-Man is going to get cheated if they watch it. There is a part in the movie where Mary Jane is falling from the George Washington Bridge. Hmm, if anyone has read Spider-Man, they will know that Staci, Spider-Man's old girlfriend, was killed by being thrown from the same bridge by, who else, THE GREEN GOBLIN! It's the same as the comic book, damn, at least X-Men tried to bring in an original story to its movie, why can't Spider-Man do the same? 2/10 *'s
9.0~A hero is born The_Amazing_Spy_Rises Sign in Permalink This is obviously one of the most influential films of the 2000's, because of the impact 'Spider-Man' had on the nation. This film was the first true blockbuster to come out since 9/11, and this film gave the country something to hold on to, even though he doesn't exist: a hero. Spider-Man means something to the American public more than any of the heroes, because the film makes him out to be just like us: human. He is just a human being fighting for the good of mankind, saving people left and right, not to mention risking his life all the time. The USA public attached so much to this character and this film after 9/11, and I think that is one reason why it has the second largest opening of all time. Tobey Maguire is brilliant as Spider-Man AND Peter Parker. There are actors that can play Spidey. There are actors that can play Peter. Maguire is the only one who can do BOTH. He provides the most likable character in the entire superhero realm with a great touch of dedication to the role. I'm indifferent on Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson, as she could be better, and there's moments where she can get annoying. She does have her moments though, especially in the end of this film and its sequels. The villain of the film is Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin, who is utterly creepy and scary in every sense of the word. He gives a truly chilling and classic performance. The visual effects are not as good as one would hope, as you can clearly see when voiceovers and computers are used to get the desired effect, but this is a non issue. Spider-Man remains one of my all time favorite movies, through and through. An explanation of the plot is not necessary, but a short synopsis would be this: Nerdy Peter Parker gets bit by a genetically altered spider, giving him amazing powers mirroring those of the arachnid, and he becomes the web-slinging vigilante known as Spider-Man. It's great film that the whole family can enjoy, no doubt. There are some scary moments, but no use of foul language, so I'd say the film is appropriate for kids ages 10 and up. I really love this film and its sequel, and I know I'll love the three-quel. 9/10 --spy
7.0~Thank you Sam! atzimo Sign in Permalink Thank you Sam Raimi for the wet dress scene. It was amazing! The highlight of the entire movie! The rest was more or less expected judging from the pre-views: Boring and meaningless story (what did the Green Goblin want from Spider-Man anyway?), mediocre visual effects (yes, they were), but also good acting and direction. Overall it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.
8.0~Best Comic Book Adaptation Yet. mick_foley_4life Sign in Permalink I entered Spider-man somewhat skeptical as to what it would be like. Especially following all the horrible comic movie made (Captain America, The Batman Movies) Yet Spider-Man is able to stay true to the original story and still offer a satisfying ending. The cast was outstanding. Everyone acted and looked good in their roles. Especially nice were the cameos (Lucy Lawless, Bruce Cambell & "Mach Man" Randy Savage). The pacing and storytelling were exceptional. They managed to cover alot of ground in Spider-Man's history without rushing the movie, skipping points or pulling a "Lord Of The Rings" on us. Little teasers are even present for comic fans. I will not elaborate but you'll see them. The music and fight scenes left a little to be desired though. The fighting was a little Matrixy (not in the good way) and the music was really Batman-like. However these details are trivial in the long run. I highly recommend Spider-Man. It delivers on it's hype and restores my faith in "hollywood" movies.
9.0~Perhaps quaint by today's standards, the timelessness and whimsy of "Spider-Man" help it excel. It still stands as one of the most important comic-book movies ever made. MaximumMadness Sign in Permalink It's hard to believe it's been so long since director Sam Raimi reintroduced the beloved character of Spider-Man to film-goers with one of 2002's biggest releases. It truly was a magical time, and "Spider- Man" was very much to thank for this. Critically lauded and adored by the public, it was not only the first film to gross over $100 million in its opening weekend, but it was also the next big step in comic- book adaptations, ushering the public closer to understanding just how important comic books were and how much potential there was to make high-quality films inspired by these modern day myths. Films like "Blade" and "X-Men" were for sure the important first steps towards this, but it was "Spider-Man" that delivered on this promise, with its impact still being felt to this very day thanks to the rise of franchises like the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Yes, it is hard to believe how long it's been. Heck, the movie itself would now be old enough to be in High School just like Peter were it a person. Peter Parker (Tobey Macguire) is a nerdy high school student pining after his crush Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and dodging bullies with his best friend Harry. (James Franco) However, a school trip leads Parker towards a new and heroic life when a genetically-engineered "Super-Spider" bites him, granting him superhuman abilities. After the tragic death of his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), Peter chooses to use these abilities to protect the innocent, becoming the super-hero "Spider-Man." However, when Harry's father Norman Osbourne (Willem Dafoe) is similarly gifted superhuman abilities in a tragic accident and becomes the dreaded supervillain "Green Goblin", Peter will be torn as he will be forced to combat not only the father of his best friend, but a man he has come to greatly respect. Part of the great appeal is the lush and exquisite style injected into it thanks to the playful and thoughtful direction courtesy Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp's strangely old- fashioned yet appealing writing. The duo form a perfect union to tell the tale. Raimi- at the time best known as director of low-budget horror/comedies like the wonderful "Evil Dead" trilogy and quirky studio projects like "A Simple Plan"- has a unique visual voice that lent itself well to the character. Himself a fan of Spidey's earlier comic-book adventures, Raimi is perhaps one of the few directors who was truly able to paint a film that felt like a comic come to life. With his wild and exotic camera-work, a fantastic sense of scope and color, and a sense of quirky "fun", it's just a wonder to behold, with such a magical and whimsical feel. Koepp's script is also a great deal of fun. As I said, it has an almost old-fashioned tone. It almost feels more akin to classics like Donner's "Superman" or Burton's "Batman" in terms of structure and dialog, with everything just slightly "off" of feeling modern, but in an appealing way. It gives the film a sense of timelessness. It doesn't feel a product of its time... it feels like the sort of film that could have been made at any time- the 70's, 80's, 90's... even now. And it's a big part of what helps maintain the film's freshness. As much as I enjoyed the 2012 reboot, it very much was the product of its time, and I find it feels more dated than this take on the character despite being much younger a film. The cast is phenomenal, and are also a major contributor to its high quality. For many, Maguire defined the character. He nails just the right tone as Peter Parker, playing him as the sort-of archetypal underdog you can't help but root for thanks to his kind heart and depth of character. He also made for a great web-slinger, though I will admit the humor and banter was lacking. Dunst is just a lovable female lead, even when the film doesn't go out of its way to give her much development or depth. (Though this film is very much Peter's tale, so I can forgive a somewhat cliché love interest.) Franco is a ton of fun and the seeds are planted for the future development of the character. Dafoe is just wonderful, nailing the perfect balance between flawed but good- natured father-figure and scenery-chewing madman from scene to scene. Robertson is a joy as Uncle Ben. And supporting roles like the fabulous Rosemary Harris as Aunt May are fantastic. Compounding this is an absolutely magnificent score by Danny Elfman. A legend in the field, Elfman's themes help to accentuate the visuals and lend a sense of grandiose to the proceedings. It nails the right sound of just borderline melodrama mixed with grand old majestic heroics. To this day, the opening titles still give me chills, and I still associate any depiction of Spider-Man with his themes in my mind. All of this praise being said, I can't help but admit the film has some flaws, which is where it does lose a point for me. Despite his structuring and sensibilities being great fun, Koepp's dialog is... a little too out-there. A little too manufactured, even for the quirky tone he and Raimi are going for. Some pacing problems are apparent, particularly in the first and third acts, leading to speed-up's and slow-down's that can be jarring. And even for the time, some of the effects were... sub- par. (It wasn't until about the third film that the CGI used on Spider- Man looked totally realistic.) "Spider-Man" to this day stands among the most important superhero movies of all time. And this is thanks not only to the records it broke, or to the paths it paved for future films... but also very much for its quality and grand sense of entertainment. And it is most certainly worth a near-perfect 9 out of 10.
9.0~A Spectacular Start to the "Spider-Man" Trilogy carologletree Sign in Permalink The first Spider-Man film is a great one. Marvel arrived on the scene in 2000 with the solid if unspectacular "X-Men," but it was kicked into higher gear in 2002 with the release of "Spider-Man." Tobey Maguire is phenomenal as Peter Parker, bringing just the right amount of nerdiness, vulnerability, and most importantly, heart. As Spider-Man, he really seemed to be having fun. He is comparable to Keaton's Batman and Reeve's Superman. The supporting cast is very good. Kirsten Dunst is good as Mary Jane, and James Franco is also good as Harry. Other standouts are J.K. Simmons as Jonah Jamison and Willem Dafoe as Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin. Spider-Man's origin story is told quite well, and it moved along at a good pace. The film is very action-packed, and it is filled with the sense of fun that "X-Men" kind of lacked. Just the right amount of emotion is added to the film, and it also has a great soundtrack. There are a few cheesy scenes, but it is still overall a very entertaining and well-made superhero film. It was the kick in the pants that Marvel studios needed. Although this film would be surpassed by it's sequel, "Spider-Man 2," it is still not to be missed. RATING: A-
8.0~Superior superhero flicks have been made in recent years, but this is still a good one Electrified_Voltage Sign in Permalink A good bunch of live action adaptations of superhero comic books have made it into theatres so far in the 2000s. There has been the "X-Men" trilogy, several "Spider-Man" movies, "Hulk", "Catwoman" (a Batman spin-off), the first "Batman" movie in a while, etc. Some of them have turned out to be excellent, while some have failed. This first installment in the "Spider-Man" movie franchise, which turned out to be an absolute success upon its release in 2002, isn't the best superhero movie of the decade, but it certainly isn't the worst. In the beginning, Peter Parker is a very unpopular high school student who is often picked on. However, while in a laboratory, he is bitten by a genetically mutated spider, and after that, he is no longer the same! He suddenly becomes very strong, and soon discovers that he can climb walls, shoot webs from his wrists, and swing around the city! He uses his new powers to swing around in a new costume to hide his identity, and fight crime in the city, going by the name Spider-Man! Meanwhile, Norman Osborn, a local scientist and the father of Peter's best friend, Harry, has created himself an alter ego as well, but an evil one, as a result of taking the performance enhancer he has developed! As Green Goblin, he begins to wreak havoc in the city, and makes Spider-Man's job as the local hero more difficult! I have seen "Spider-Man" several times since seeing it in the theatre, and have basically been impressed every time. Mind you, certain moments in this adaptation of the popular comics are a bit cheesy. The part where Peter Parker enters a wrestling match looking like a kid in a Halloween costume is a tad awkward, and some of the lines in the movie are ridiculous, including some things Peter says to Mary Jane Watson. So, this 2002 blockbuster may have a few slightly embarrassing moments, which is why it's inferior to certain other superhero flicks that have come out this decade. However, this movie also has a good amount of action, as well as some gripping moments, and maybe some occasional humour. While this first installment in the "Spider-Man" franchise may be just a tad overrated, it sure beats "Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers" (even though there may be some slight but unfortunate resemblances), and overall, it's a good action/superhero movie. It's really not surprising that it was such a big hit. For those who are generally into movie adaptations of popular comic books, whether you're into those comic books at the moment or not, "Spider-Man" should be fun. As long as you can get over the shortcomings, and don't expect perfection, it shouldn't be a major disappointment, if a disappointment at all.
1.0~This film is about as exciting as... nicka-11 Sign in Permalink ...spending an evening de-scaling your kettle, or, dare I say, clipping the toenails of you and your entire family (including grandparents). I went to see this film to see what the fuss was all about. The storyline is entirely predictable, even to those who have never read the comic books. I would put it into the ever growing category of films with a poor storyline, poor acting, but with expensive and overblown special effects whose aim is to disguise the film-maker's total lack of imagination. The only reason people tend to give for liking this film is the special effects. Unfortunately, this kind of effects can be seen in pretty much all the action films that come off Hollywood's conveyor belt of uninspired, unimaginative junk these days. I hate to sound like a miserable old man, even though I'm only twenty eight, but it seems that film-makers these days know they don't need to go to much effort to make a successful film. They need just need a predictable story-line with a happy ending, and a clunky, corny script. They then pay an enormous amount of money for some passé special effects, knowing that they will still make a fortune at the box-office due to over-hype and the hordes of witless westerners who are too stupid to appreciate any film which is remotely challenging. I know I am not comparing like with like, but films such as It's A Wonderful Life, Casablanca, The Wicker Man, The Shawshank Redemption and Leon (off the top of my head) are superb stories with engaging characters and good acting. None of these aspects seem important anymore. Just throw in a load of special effects and you'll make a fortune. Moreover, why does every remotely successful film have a sequel these days? I'll tell you why; to make even more cash. And the sequels tend to be even worse than the first film. If It's A Wonderful Life had been made fifty years later, we would have definitely seen an It's A Wonderful Life 2 and 3. It's not about creating a great moment in cinematic history; it's all about making oodles of cash. Rant over.
10.0~Spider Man unegwadaa Sign in Permalink The caracter of my movie is Peter Parker. The movie takes place in the city of New York. Peter Parker was bittenby a spider aften this he was a super hero. He is one of the most famous of the a super heros. It an anction movie, with a lot of wrapoms.
8.0~The Marvel movie that started all KineticSeoul Sign in Permalink This is a superhero movie that didn't try to get all gritty, serious and full of twist and turns to make it a engaging superhero movie. Instead it's a friendly superhero movie that is just overall fun to watch. Plus there weren't many superhero movies like this, so the audiences were just blown away watching Spidey swing around New York. Yeah, the plot is generic and the CGI is outdated in today's standards but it was a great movie when it came out. I remember first seeing the trailer for this movie and was just amazed by it. Since at that time I have never seen anything like this, despite it leaning toward the cheesy side in today's standards. Spider-Man was my favorite superhero at that time. So as a kid I was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end and wanted to see it again once it was finished. I am not sure if Tobey Maguire was the best choice for the role as Peter Parker. But he played his character as a likable and nice science nerd. Although not as snappy and taunting as Spider-Man but he was believable as a nerd with the heart of gold. This movie doesn't pull much punches, but it has enough of Spider- Man in it with a story-line that for the most part follows through. Despite it not being very accurate to the comics, it does carry on the essence of Spider-Man. I even liked the theme song, despite few very cheesy scores but the theme song by Danny Elfman is spot on. Overall this is a fun and friendly superhero movie worth checking out. 8.4/10
6.0~Mediocre story & character development; good effects Michael-Lou Sign in Permalink I rarely see movies in the theater, but went to see this one because it looked like it had a lot of potential. I was very disappointed, but I thought it might have been because my expectations were so high. I just watched it again on DVD and it didn't get any better the second time. Note: spoiler upcoming. The story didn't quite make the delicate balance between reality and fantasy. It was either not real enough or not comic-booky enough. It was a bad mix of both. But the worst part for me was when he told her that being a friend was all he could give her, and then he walked away, leaving her crying. I mean, what kind of a schmuck would do that, even if he couldn't have a relationship with her? How about something more like: "I'm so sorry. I have always loved you, and I will always love you. But I can't be in a relationship with you or anyone right now, and maybe not ever. It hurts me deeply to say that, and I'm sorry I can't explain why. But you must know that I will always be your friend, and I will always take care of you. You mean the world to me." It would be corny enough to match the rest of the movie, but at least it would be an honorable way to break her heart.
4.0~So stupid it's not even funny anymore Ruafo Sign in Permalink Granted, Spiderman does have some excellent special effects, and it does have some above average camera work, but apart from that it's all hype. None of the actors can really carry this movie. Neither Tobey Maguire, nor Kirsten Dunst are actually believable in their roles; the worst performance however is delivered by Willem Dafoe. While he makes a decent attempt, he simply cannot put any motive or sense in the Green Goblin. I don't think he is to blame, though, I doubt anyone could with a character so ridiculous. The real problem with the movie however lies with the plot. It is so absolutely laughable and predictable that one might be tempted to write this whole thing off as a comedy that tries to make fun of the genre. Such an approach could actually work - the movie however takes itself way to seriously for that. Maybe the picture is watch able if you have read the Spiderman comics. I never have - for me it was a perfect example of a movie that needed not be made. Infinitely inferior to that other comic-book-superhero-movie: X-Men. 4 out of 10 (for camerawork)
9.0~the yarn is a real spin! wicked_witch81 Sign in Permalink I have been waiting for this movie for years,if not,decades!!!!When i found out that Freddie Prince Jnr. was auditioning for the role of spiderman,i thought that the movie's gonna go down the drains!i mean,sure,freddie's cute and all..but as spider-man???no way!then there's the rumour that Leonardo Dicaprio and Ryan Phillipe trying out for the part as well.Heck,those two don't have the 'pizzazz' to carry out such an important hero character that's been idolized for years!so imagine my surprise when i found out that Tobey Maguire is gonna be spider-man.i thought that he was just perfect,and after watching the movie,i was right! =) The 2002 movie version of spider-man is much more cooler than the spider-man from the tv series!Sam Raimi managed to bring out the cartoon spider-man to life!The movie covers every single detail of the webbed hero:from the way he climbs the walls,and the whole swinging from a string of web to another.Die hard fans of spider-man won't be disappointed by the movie,because it follows the comic faithfully!The Green Goblin,played by William Dafoe is the perfect nemesis for Spiderman,and William portrayed this character very well.I was kind of disappointed that Kirsten Dunst took on the role of Mary Jane Watson.Hey,don't get me wrong!i like Kirsten a lot,especially in movies like 'Virgin Suicides' and 'Bring it On',but i felt that the role should be given to a real redhead like Alicia Witt.i think she'd make a better Mary jane than Kirsten Dunst.but still,that little tid bit didn't ruin the movie for me!All in all,i think spiderman has cast his web,uh,i mean spell on me! =P
7.0~Good portrayal of a classic figure in comic book history noizyme Sign in Permalink I found myself reluctant to go to the theater and see this film because of its franchise possibilities and overall questioning of the film-maker's motives on making this film. I think it hit people hard as a hero film for the modern day, post-9/11 crowd who felt that there needs to be a figure who stands for hope and overcoming obstacles. Also Marvel Films needed a comic movie about a classic character to move their ideas forward after stirring endlessly about their idea to do the Fantastic Four film. I thought that Toby Maguire did a great job as the innocent, boyish Peter Parker whose obstacles were overcome through the (un)fortunate bite of a rare spider (which the film makes seem unbelievable) which allows him to mature both physically and mentally much faster. After a ton of things happen to those he loves throughout the film, he grows up much faster than he ever thought and learns to take on these responsibilities of society to the utmost degree by becoming the hero for the city (which I believe is New York City). When his best friend's father develops a performance-enhancing process that changes him into the much-feared Green Goblin, Maguire's Spiderman has to juggle those that he loves, hates, and is obliged to save from harm in the city. Kirsten Dunst played the lovable Mary Jane (too bad Rick James couldn't license his song for the movie...that would've been funny.) She plays the sappy love-interest-role quite sappy indeed, but she's hot enough to get your mind off her acting. Willem Dafoe played a schizo-green goblin whose mind was torn between what was good for himself and what might potentially gain him solace for losing his company and lifestyle forever. Seeing J.K. Simmons as Mr. Jameson, the newspaper boss, was great because he looked like he always had in the comic book. He also respawned the attitude from the old 70's cartoon of spiderman as well. Sam Raimi did a beautiful job directed this film, with all the twists and turns that Spiderman could achieve with the camera angles and everything. It confuses me how he was picked to be the director of this type of film after making hits like Evil Dead and Darkman, but he did a good job altogether. Danny Elfman's musical score was (and is) always great to hear...spooky and foreboding with a heroic standard sound built around every piece. I don't like the fact that this character and movie just builds a basis on marketing and getting pop-songs out to the market (as this did with Nickelback's Chad Kroeger's song and Corey Taylor's song "Bother" which go success from this movie but was never played in the film). Also I wish they would've kept some of the older qualities to Spiderman and this movie, like keeping the old Green Goblin looking the same...I hate the metallic look. I didn't like the sappiness of the love story, but it was good to see a different take on the same man loving Mary Jane (Spiderman and Peter Parker). I gave it a 7/10 because it's not a great film that needs to be remembered always, but it does have moments that make you appreciate what work went into it. It took balls to put this out because the industry sometimes gets saturated with these comic-book-to-movie ideas, but this is a classic character who needed his own film at sometime. Batman and Superman were done and overplayed, and now it's Spiderman's turn. If the director, composer, and actors stay the same, they'll have a hit for awhile, I think.
5.0~Overrated snlfan3300 Sign in Permalink Spider-man has been anxiously awaited by many people, including myself. And, although the cinematography in this film is superb, I think that this movie was not lived up to my expectations. The acting was pretty good, and, like I said, the cinematography was excellent, but I felt that the plot was not very good. The whole "Green Goblin" character was too much of the typical villian. They could have gotten more creative in the script, and they could have put a few twists into the movie. To me, this was the typical superhero movie, and I did not see anything that makes it unique among other superhero movies. And, I completely disagree with this movie being in the top 250 (as it is at this point in time). For what it's worth, this movie was partially entertaining and vastly overrated. RATING: 5/10
9.0~A major return to form for Sam Raimi after the disappointing "the Gift" (2000) dbdumonteil Sign in Permalink Adaptations of comics for the screen have become one of Hollywood's main specialties. So far, most of super-heroes for their transition to the screen were entitled to a reliable film-maker and not to a director of musical video clips. Thus, Tim Burton shot "Batman" in 1989 while Bryan Singer amazed with his movie "X-Men" (2000). Here, it is Sam Raimi who decided to adapt the adventures of Spider-Man; a plan he surely undertook with joy. Indeed, this iconoclastic film-maker is an avid fan of the comic strip. So, he seemed to be cut out more than anyone else for the film. A surprise: his work doesn't disappoint and maintains itself high above the expectations and is incredibly exhilarating. The movie has been a (largely deserved) triumphant success and for Sam Raimi it was his long-awaited commercial breakthrough. Maybe it wasn't such a bad thing for him to have moved in the Hollywood mainstream. Why is "Spider-Man" so successful? Simply because Raimi hired a winning team at all levels. First, Raimi's making reflects the enthusiasm he felt to shot his movie. Full of energy, liveliness, it doesn't leave a minute's rest to the spectator. We are carried away by the adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man with a lot of frenzy and happiness. It is useful to note down that at the end of the projection, you feel so happy that you ask for more! To come back to Raimi's making, there's a perfect marriage between impressive action sequences and the interesting psychological portrait Raimi makes of his main character. On another hand, the indispensable amounts of humor and emotion haven't been forgotten. Congratulations to the scriptwriter David Koepp. Why didn't he get an Oscar for his work? He has written a watertight screenplay which is flawless. It does everything to remain faithful to the original comic strip. More important, Koepp conceived his script, mainly as a kind of apprenticeship. Peter Parker will test the extent of his powers (first against one of his rivals in his high school, then during a wrestling fight) before putting his red and blue suit on and facing violence in New York and eventually the Green Buffoon (Im not sure if it's the right name). A brilliant screenplay wouldn't be anything without a suitable cast. It is of an impeccable quality. Thanks to "Spider-Man" Tobey McGuire probably finds the role of his life. At last a role at the extent of his talent. Beside him, Kirsten Dunst has such an appealing charm that it is difficult to resist her. Willem Dafoe is just amazing in his role of wicked. As for JK Simmons, he may have a short role but each of his apparitions is a delight so much that he nearly steals the show to the other actors. But special effects aren't always subtle or sometimes a little too intrusive and David Koepp has forgotten to remove a few clichés about his main character, notably at the beginning of the film. But fortunately, they are tiny details and if we ignore them, "Spider-Man" appears as a blockbuster whose homogeneity is impressive. It satisfies both the fans of the comic strip but also movie lovers. Raimi's masterpiece lasts about two hours. Not a minute is too much in it. You can't refuse such an exciting show like this one. The second part of the adventures of Spider-Man was launched in the summer 2004 with the same crew and was equally successful as the first one. As we say: we don't change a winning team. Well done Mr Raimi!
8.0~SPIDERMAN : Great Comic-Book Adaptation... cwrdlylyn Sign in Permalink SPIDERMAN I've been meaning to see SPIDERMAN 2 b/c I know it had a very passionate following so when I came across the original on television I figured I'd remind myself of everything that happened in the first film. I saw the first SPIDERMAN in theaters when it first came out and I remember just being surprised by how entertaining the whole thing was... and though knowing what comes next does ruin some of the fun, SPIDERMAN is still a really great comic book adaptation. Sam Raimi's SPIDERMAN tells the story of Peter Parker (played by a perfectly cast Toby Maguire) and his origins as Spiderman. As Parker gets used to his new role as a superhero, he also struggles with his feelings towards his life-time crush Mary-Jane (played by Kirsten Dunst). To complicate matters, New York suddenly finds itself in danger of the Green Goblin (played by a perfectly cast Willem Dafoe) who only Spiderman can fight back. SPIDERMAN isn't like a typical action/superhero movie. The film certainly takes it's time between action sequences and thrills... and upon reflection the film is rather tame in comparison to other blockbusters when it comes to action. This isn't to say SPIDERMAN lacks excitement however. Actually, it's a good film because it excels so much in it's story driven scenes. The story they are telling in this movie isn't the most complicated or realistic ever captured on film... but it is filmed with an exuberance and energy unlike many films. It is like a young boy's vision of what a comic-book should be, told with the master-craftsmanship of a skilled director. Instead of choosing to show blood and violence all the time, Raimi creates extended sequences of Peter Parker's sheer joy and excitement discovering he can jump over building and swing throughout New York. Raimi perfectly balances both the dark side and the lighthearted side of this story. Sometimes a film doesn't have to have an important message or a revelatory story to make it good... it just needs to be told well. SPIDERMAN succeeds at taking it's material and making everything out of it it possibly could. Peter Parker is both an incredibly endearing hero, while the audience also sympathizes with his demons... and I can't wait to watch the follow-up next time I go to the video store. ... B+ ...
5.0~Sad, really. Jack the Ripper1888 Sign in Permalink This movie was a good example of how badly people can adapt things. David Koepp did a great job writing PANIC ROOM and STIR OF ECHOES and even JURASSIC PARK. But, what the hell was he thinking here? This is not a very good movie. And even if no one reads this review, be warned. Sam Raimi, the director of THE EVIL DEAD, was stupid to take this film into his hands. Or, maybe it was smart of him to do. Because so many people have seen this film. Most of them are probably little toddlers under the age of ten. That is the crowd this film mainly aims to please. This whole thing is like one, long, stupid, dull episode of Power Rangers. Some of the dialogue just made me want to die laughing. EX. Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) says to Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) "This isn't over yet, we'll meet again Spider-Man". Now, tell me what kind of villain would say that in a film. The earlier X-MEN did a far better job of adapting a Marvel comic onto the screen, aiming to please audiences that weren't just ten and younger. David Koepp may be a great writer at coming up with original and creative ideas, but he should never adapt another comic. The movie just got worse from then on. The only thing that saved this film was Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson and the dramatic and exciting action sequences (which is mainly when the cheesy dialogue is spoken). My other complaint is some of the unbelievable parts. (Read no further if you haven't seen the film) One part is when Spider-Man is holding on to a trolley car filled with little kids with just one arm while hanging onto a bridge with the other. Even if he is super-human and stuff, If he can get cut and start to bleed, then I would think that he wouldn't be as strong enough as to be able to hold up an entire trolley. And then there were the special effects. You could always tell that Spider-Man and the Green Goblin both were almost always computer animated. And it is so sad. It looks like they try to make them look computer animated here. They don't even want them to look real. What, is that the 'cooler' thing nowadays? If so, when did that happen? I'll bet you fifty bucks that we're going to be seeing a trillion movies that try to rip-off the success of this one. I have already heard that a sequel is in the works. As if the first one wasn't bad enough, what's the second one gonna be about? I just want to vomit at the thought of this movie being #95 on the best-picture list in the database. Surely you jest. Maybe the bottom films of all time. Now, the best thing that this movie has going for it is the fact that you will jump at one part. Some of the action sequences were okay too. Just a lot of bad dialogue and stupid acting. SPIDER-MAN: 2/5. Oh, me and my friend died laughing at Willem Dafoe's two lines "I brought a fruitcake" and "I hope you enjoy the fruitcake".
9.0~Excellent and true to the real story michael-138 Sign in Permalink I expected this movie to be good after seeing the incredibly real web-swinging in the trailer. It was actually BETTER than I'd thought it would be. The spidey effects are fantastic, of course. But the story was also engrossing. It follows VERY closely the original comic book story, with just a few minor changes. The characters in this movie - as is generally the case with Marvel characters - are real and you can relate to them. Tobey Maguire (who I still believe is too short to play Spidey) was pretty good as Peter Parker. Dunst was excellent as Mary Jane. Willem Dafoe was fine but the costume they stuck him in as the Green Goblin was criminally bad; you couldn't see anything of him except his mouth - very lame. J Jonah Jameson was portrayed very well; VERY funny. The special effects here were simply great. The web-spinning, cameras moving with Spidey, and especially the costume will leave the TRUE Spiderman fans happy. There are Spiderman moves that are IDENTICAL to the original cartoon moves, only better; and moving camera angles that give a really exciting view of his work as he swings through New York. Great movie top to bottom. 9/10.
8.0~Just misses perfection Chris-195 Sign in Permalink It's a great movie, but the poorly developed relationship between Peter Parker and Norman Osborn weakens the impact. The emotional climax hinges on this pseudo father-son relationship, yet the film doesn't develop it well. There are moments, glimpses of it, but not enough. The first time, it didn't dawn on me that Peter's real choice was between Ben Parker and Norman. I mean, what had we been shown to indicate that he even admired Norman, aside from having read his work? Anyway, I've always found the Green Goblin overrated, and I'm looking more forward to other villains. That said, it's a great movie, great effects, killer first half, good second half.
10.0~The best comic book adaption ever! watto124 Sign in Permalink Wonderful, colorful, and extremely well made, Sam Raimi's "Spider-Man" undertaking has proved its worth and some. It is a very satisfying vision of the comic book that stays very true to the source material. The story, characters, and overall feel of an actual comic book have never really been faithfully adapted to a motion picture until now. The acting is pitch-perfect as well, from Tobey Maguire's nearly heartbreaking portrayal of Peter Parker, to Kirsten Dunst giving Mary Jane a very insecure persona. And Willem Dafoe, of course, hams it up appropriately as Norman Osborn, whose hidden agenda is Spider-Man's arch-nemesis, the Green Goblin. The special effects sequences are truly a spectacle. They are thunderous, stunning races through Manhattan's concrete jungles that blur the line between CG images and reality. My only gripe about the movie is that it moves at a cheetah's pace, sometimes at the sacrifice of some of the movie's dramatic punch. But hey, that's excusable due to the fact that the film is based on comic book, and shouldn't pretend it is based on Shakespeare. Another lame bit is the presence of Macy Gray, which for reasons I can't quite put my finger on, kind of detracts from the movie (though only in a small way). If she's gonna be in films she should stick to the stuff she did in "Training Day". But even with these two barely significant quirks, "Spider-Man" is an exciting, and fantastic movie with awesome acting, characters, music, and special effects. Go se it, even if you just go for J.K. Simmons' hiarious performance as the liberal media tyrant J. Jonah Jameson. The movie is a thrilling experience and we can only hope that Raimi and company reunite for a sequel in the future. 10/10
9.0~UNIQUE DEPTH FOR A COMIC BOOK MOVIE Norwegianheretic Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi has pulled off what every director would like to: He has presented the struggle between good and evil in a plausible manner without betraying the broadstroke style of the cartoon genre - and he's done it without anything schmaltzy, anything cliched, anything formulized. Quite simply, he has produced the finest cartoon movie ever made. And he's accomplished this despite the overproduced and self-indulgent(hit every sound effect cue)score by Danny Elfman. There is a naivete, rare in Hollywood, in Raimi's handling of what might otherwise be considered pure popcorn fare. With SPIDER-MAN, in spite of the huge franchise this movie represents, Raimi has managed to remain true to his heart felt visions. This seems like a movie made by a director who, like spider-man, has remained an idealist even though he has come up against the forces of the Glittering Goblins of the major studio machine. Let's hope that Raimi continues to deal with material like this, material which pleases the people in its sincerity rather than the material which gains the approval of the critics (like A SIMPLE PLAN)in its austerity.
9.0~Superb adaptation; has a lot of parallels with Smallville perfectbond Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi's Spider-man has a lot of parallels with Alfred Gough's and Miles Millar's Smallville television series which chronicles the adventures of a young Clark Kent. Both Peter and Clark are high school students struggling to fit in. Both have a love interest that seems out of reach; Mary Jane for Peter and Lana Lang for Clark. Both budding superheroes come from modest households and yet also have warm and caring adoptive families. Both of them have rich best friends who flirt with the darker side of human nature; Harry Osborn and Lex Luthor. Eventually both their best friends will become their nemeses. And the fathers of their best friends, Norman Osborn and Lionel Luthor, both extend genuine fatherly admiration for Peter and Clark respectively. As for the movie itself, Spider-man is an excellent translation of comic book to silver screen. Along the way there were some liberties taken, like the fact that Peter's ability to shoot webs is another result of the genetically modified spider's bite rather than his manufacturing of web shooters as was shown in the comics, but all in all the spirit of the source material is maintained. The action sequences and CGI were thrilling upon first viewing in the cinema and they hold up fairly well today although it has to be remembered that technology pushes ever forward. But the action scenes are only a secondary pleasure of the film. The primary pleasure is in watching the relationship between the characters unfurl. At the risk of sounding like a sap, I thought Tobey and Kirsten did a marvelous job in showing how young Shakesperean romantic love develops. I truly felt the euphoria that such an emotion generates. To use a cliché, the two had great chemistry. The warmth and caring of the Parker household was also very touching and the tragedy of Ben Parker's demise, frankly, gets to me every time. To me, however, the most intriguing relationships are the ones between Harry and Norman and Harry and Peter. The viewer can empathize with Harry's yearning for love and recognition from the senior Osborn and the jealousy he must feel at his father's interest in Peter. The scene where Harry concedes that his father was 'right about M.J., right about everything' and Norman admits that he 'hasn't always been there' for his son was played to great effect by James Franco and Willem Dafoe. The relationship between Peter and Harry is also a marvel (no pun intended) to watch unfold. We see their almost brotherly camaraderie at the field trip turn into understated awkwardness and tension over Harry's interest in Peter's girl. The mutual empathy over the parallel losses of their fathers briefly brings them together again until Harry swears a vendetta against Peter's alter ego meaning they are now enemies. Great stuff! I can't wait to see how this develops in further installments of the franchise. All the secondary characters are well cast also. Special mention must be made of Bonesaw (played by real life wrestler Randy 'Macho Man' Savage) and J. Jonah Jameson (played by J.K. Simmons who to a degree reprises his role as Sheriff Pearl Johnson in The Gift which not coincidentally was also directed by Raimi). If I have one minor quibble it would be that I wish that the Peter's first love from the comics, Gwen Stacy, could somehow have been written in. She is such a great character. Then again, to do so would probably dilute the Pete-M.J. story arc. The two-disc editions have a wealth of info and special features, more than enough to satisfy the most ravenous curiosity over the film.
7.0~Better than I expected J.M. Fan Club Sign in Permalink When I first heard they were making a Spider-Man movie, I was horrified. The thought of seeing Toby MaGuire dressed as Spider-Man just had me thinking of the Power Rangers, and that's about what I was expecting. The more I saw the trailers, and the more I saw the commercials, the more I wanted to really hate this movie. At the same time, I found myself this past week really curious about the film, and thinking it may be better than what I expect. And I must admit, this was a good movie. The story wasn't great, but it was good enough to keep my interest. The love story between Mary Jane and Peter Parker actually added to the movie, which is usually not the case in the super hero genre of film. There were a couple moments when I was reminded of the Power Rangers, but those moments usually came from the Green Goblin, and not from Spier-Man. I think the most amazing thing is there were several attempts at humor, and for most part, they were actually funny (my personal favorite came when Peter Parker was on the roof attempting to figure out how to sling his webs). So despite my best efforts, I did enjoy Spider-Man. So if you are a Spider-Man fan, or just think Kristen Dunst looked really hot with red hair, you should enjoy this movie.
8.0~The best superhero film of all time? Maybe funkyfry Sign in Permalink An extraordinary example of the superhero genre of action films -- it manages to create in the audience a sympathy with Peter Parker (Maguire), the high school student turned "Spider-Man", as well as a sense of shared, vicarious joy as spidey discovers his tremendous powers. The movie is fun and funny, Raimi providing a fast-moving arena for the excellently realized CGI spidey to do his tricks (just watching it made me want to go buy the game for X-box, but I haven't gotten around to it yet). He must face the Green Goblin, his classic foe, played to a 2-sided malicious tee by Dafoe, whose character doubles as a big-time weapons manufacturer. Dunst and Franco are merely adequate. That rare kind of superhero film that left me itching for the sequel -- bring it on, Marvel!
7.0~Thank god for rain, thank god for ( Y )s ThE_pSyChOtIc _PoEt Sign in Permalink Saw this yesterday, and can say I was reletively impressed. Good, not too heavy entertainment and great direction and cast performances, Kirsten Dunst very satisfying as the traditional female superhero love interest from my pervy perspective. Most definitely superior to slightly more hyped star wars, the only let down being the cringe-worthy green goblin costume they nicked from power rangers. 7/10
10.0~The best film EVER franky4fingers Sign in Permalink I just got back from seeing Spider-man at my local cine and it was absolutely stunning. While buying hot dogs and drinks, my mate and i were having a chuckle at all the children and grown men alike with the spider-man shirts and such. Once we saw the film though, we could understand where they are coming from. I was never seriously into comic books but i knew the story and of course had the plastic arm band that shot out silly-string. The special affects were great and i was just blown away by the whole thing. I give this film a 10/10 definitely for good plot, casting, and simply amazing effects!!!
10.0~The best superhero movie yet made. seawasp Sign in Permalink The trailers for Spider-Man looked impressive. In keeping with some prior disappointments, I tried to keep my expectations low -- telling myself cynically "they always choose the three good minutes for the trailers", and other similar things. I could not have been more wrong. This IS Spider-Man. Finally, after all these years, the technology is available to do the effects and has met with a director, scriptwriter, and team of actors capable of doing the entire thing justice. The original Superman was good (and Christopher Reeve will always be Superman to me); the Batman movie touched on the essence of the Dark Knight; and the more recent X-Men (to use modern vernacular) kicked ass. But none of them even APPROACH Spider- Man in terms of making a comic book LIVE -- making it acceptable on the big screen, without sacrificing one iota of what made that comic a classic. Peter Parker -- stammering, graceless geek -- appears onscreen in the first few minutes. And he's exactly what we knew he used to be. True, the radioactive spider which gave the original Spider-Man his powers is switched for an updated, genetically-engineered spider. But everything else is perfect. The movie takes us through ALL the essentials of what made Peter the hero he is, and somehow does it WITHOUT feeling rushed. The tragedy of his Uncle Ben's death, the angst surrounding his failure to act at a critical moment, his inability to act in private life while almost indecently extroverted as Spider-Man, the origin of the Green Goblin, the conflict of superheroic power with protecting those you love... it's all there, and not one bit of it skimped. The Green Goblin's updated look is excellent -- frightening and creepy. One of the true triumphs of the movie is the movement and combat; no prior attempt at Spider-Man, even the animated ones, has managed to capture the smooth, impossible, sometimes alien movements of the Web-Slinger, but here they're not just attempted, but pulled off with a virtuoso flair that makes it look easy. The fight scenes work -- and this is no small thing, when you're dealing with people who are doing impossible things to begin with. Finally, they somehow manage to make the classic Spider-Man costume look GOOD on-screen, even though one would have thought that there's no way it could avoid looking hokey. Laying aside the effects (and that's hard to do, when they're as amazing as the ones here), the other critical part of Spider-Man is the people. We have to believe in these people as being real, no matter how ludicrous the situations are... and we do. Tobey Maguire and William Dafoe put on stellar performances, Maguire as Parker and Dafoe as the tormented Norman Osborne. The rest of the cast don't fail the main actors -- it's hard to tell whether they measure up to the standard the other two set simply because no one else, even Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane Watson, is really given a role that challenges their abilities as much. It's not easy to make a raving lunatic supervillain convincing, but Dafoe manages that difficult feat, just as Maguire makes us believe both sides of Peter Parker. If you've EVER enjoyed superheroes at all, do NOT miss this movie.
10.0~truly the Amazing Spider-man davidcinnella Sign in Permalink I saw this movie back in 2002 when I was still a kid at our local cinema. The one we have may not be the best in the world, considering it's also not even that big and has only one screen. But that didn't matter. I saw it for the first time with three cousins of mine that summer right after school ended, and since it was a movie about a superhero I thought that I would've liked it, maybe even a lot, but nothing more. And so I entered the movie theater to enjoy the movie of a superhero I honestly never even took much into consideration. When I came out all of my nerves and senses had been burned. I walked out into the open again and I was actually convinced that I could spin spiderwebs from my wrists and that I could've climbed walls! I was so excited from what I had seen that I talked about nothing for the whole day (and probably the next too). Every single aspect of this movie is almost perfect in every way. Maybe today it could be considered less important or good since it was from 2002 and the special effects are less good and more flaws are evident, but apart from all the action, the real success of the movie lies inside it's heart. The story about a young high school student --who lives with his uncle and aunt who aren't doing all that well economically but who love him very much (great sense of family here), high I.Q., with just one friend and in love with a beautiful girl-- who suddenly gets superpowers from the tiniest of creatures ,a spider ,that will make him the enemy of his best friend's dad and, from a terrible mistake that will haunt him forever and that can happen very easily in everyday life, learns the importance of the responsibility that comes with any kind of power, and the importance of growing up in a society that is cruel, unfair, very tough and unpredictable. There is also a whole mix of betrayal and love between the characters (each different from the other) that makes it also look like if it was a Drama. Another interesting thing, from a superhero point of view, is that Spider-man isn't even a hero that is completely invincible. All in all he's just a bit stronger and faster than normal, walks on walls, spins webs from his wrists and has higher reflexes... not that much really, he's not an invincible Superman with just one (green) flaw. He has thousands of weaknesses. And yet, in spite of all that, he always manages to save the day in a unique fashion and every time with some sort of sacrifice and with always something or someone dear to him at steak. He always manages to save the day, study, work and occasionally take out the trash with a lot of effort but in the way every normal person does, with no real advantage or without even getting that much in return. I think Spider-man is a very realistic character that can be identified with anyone of us in any part of our daily routines. He also has a continuous sense of struggle in life that is very true (pretty much like Batman, but more on a common level). Also, from a cinematographic point of view it is also stunning and innovative. There's always a wonderful play with characters and their psychology in their own reflection in the mirror; great direction; more and more scenes that have now become classic ones, like Peter Parker's transformation in one night or the forever classic upside-down kiss; (for the time) great special effects and action sequences; great acting; wonderful screenplay by David Koepp; superb Music by Danny Elfman who manages to act emotions through his score; and much much more. Spider-man is, in my opinion, one of the masterpieces of movie history, one that absolutely anyone can enjoy, be amazed, loose into, cry, laugh and love. It has been Marvel's most famous superhero and, so far and for me, the best movie of all time. ... your friendly neighborhood David Cinnella
7.0~ITS A LOT BETTER THAN STAR WARS! DoctorSkyTower Sign in Permalink I am not much of a fan of comic-books-turned-into-movies, they've never really interested me (except maybe last year's X Men). I went in with mixed expectations, I'd seen reviews comparing it to Star Wars Episode II, and seen the two flicks go head to head in the ratings war... ...AND SPIDER MAN IS THE SUPERIOR OF THE TWO!!! There are some predictable/cheesy moments (re comic-book moments!!) and there is less action than I expected. There is also a lot less romance scenes to endure, but these are believable and suspension of disbelief is not an absolute necessity! The movie follows the basic plot line of the early Marvel comic books, where we learn how Peter Parker received his super powers and how he figures out how to use them. The Green Goblin I remember was this mutated freak/creature, not an 'ordinary' man decked out in corny-looking armor complete with really corny mask. His hover sled looked cool though. My only real gripe is the slowness of the story, I did expect to see more of Spider man's web slinging action and the villain wasn't really menacing enough. Anyhoo, for those who love C.G.I, there is plenty of that to look at. The C.G.I is used as a narrative tool to move the story along (Spider man and his jumping, swinging around) but doesn't devolve into a cartoonish, fake mishmash of events that drags on for 45 minutes or more. Lord of the Rings is a favorite flick of mine where the C.G.I was also used to its best effect! CONCLUSION? This flick is so much better than the boring, over-rated, over-hyped, cartoon-fest called Star Wars II! If Mr Lucas has not learned from watching the vastly superior LotR, he should at the *very* least sit down and watch this movie a dozen times to see how CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT *should* work!! 7/10
7.0~Your not superman you know....... FlashCallahan Sign in Permalink On a school field trip, Peter Parker is bitten by a genetically modified spider. He wakes up the next morning with incredible powers. After witnessing the death of his uncle, Parkers decides to put his new skills to use in order to rid the city of evil, but someone else has other plans. The Green Goblin sees Spider-Man as a threat and must dispose of him. Even if it means the Goblin has to target Parker's Aunt and the girl he secretly pines for.... The firs thing that strikes you when you watch Spiderman now, is how structured and peripheral the narrative and the story is. Foe a comic book movie telling a story, it's still probably one of the best origin stories going. But the years haven't been kind to the film, the effects have dated somewhat, especially the climbing scenes, and Maguire appears not as good as we all thought he was. But the rest of the cast are still fantastic, Dafoe is still the most shocking villain from the original trilogy, and his struggles with his dark side are is the venom running throughout the film. It can get a little stodgy at times, and Spiderman doesn't appear tow have the swagger he does in the comics, but it's still a triumph.
4.0~I blame Sam Raimi jwemmers Sign in Permalink Predictable, childish, unoriginal, disappointing. The dialogue was laughable, the special effects were frequently rubbery and shiny. McGuire's performance was one-dimensional. Spider-man has a new nemesis and his name is Sam Raimi.
4.0~Not bad I suppose Theoban Sign in Permalink Well, this film has its good points and bad points, the action sequences are well done and up to when Peter Parker actually 'becomes' Spider-Man it's actually a pretty good film. However from there it descends into the type of bland movie that usually would go straight to video. This film features some of the most awkward and just plain bad acting I have seen in a big budget film, the scene in the hospital between Parker and MJ makes me wince every time I see it, in fact I just skip right past. And the less we mention about the atrocious "New York coming together" scene at the bridge the better, it made me laugh out loud in the cinema. As for the Green Goblin, without the suit Dafoe excels as the bad guy, and is wonderful, but once he dons that green armour, he turns into the type of caricature you expect to see in a Saturday morning cartoon. Overall, this film isn't too bad, although I haven't really said many nice things about it, but the whole middle section of the film would be better left out, but thankfully in the age of the DVD we have the skip button.
10.0~Incredible ablemenet Sign in Permalink For the first time ever Spider-Man is truly brought to life, providing movie-goers with first-person view of what it's like to web-sling through New York. The film played an instrumental role in building the Super Hero genre into a credible sect of the cinematic world. With a wide range of intense, fun, and truly emotional conflicts, this film is a masterpiece, made even better by the completely flawless cast.
9.0~Stan Lee says it's better than the comics Benjy Sign in Permalink and I feel inclined not to disagree with him. This film is just plain excellent from start to finish. It's not perfect, it contains far too many cheesy lines although to be fair the majority of them come from the 60s comics so they were always bound to be cheesy but could you do Spider-Man without the "great power comes great responsibility" line? Of course not so we'll put the odd cheesy line to one side for the moment. This movie was never going to be your standard Hollywood blockbuster with the potential oddball coupling of Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire. Raimi is a talented director and throughout his career his films have had 2 things in common, entertainment and Bruce Campbell. Spider-Man disappoints on neither score. Add in the lovely Kirsten Dunst and a Green Goblin played by someone who yet again you wouldn't think would do this kind of movie (though he did do Body of Evidence....) and it's a recipe for not only box office success but also critical success. This film was always going to be the first in a series of films about one of the best superhero chracters available and it's excellence across the board merely means were unlikely to ever see one of them go straight to video. The quality of the script, acting and directing and also it's faithfulness to a comic legend means no-one should be disappointed. That all said it's not the sort of film likely to win Oscars (except the technical awards) but then Titanic isn't half the movie this is and it won a shedload. My only complaints, the odd cheesy line which I'll forgive and the Green Goblin's mask which makes him look like a Mighty Morphon Power Ranger baddie. Come on Willem Dafoe just needed his face painted green!
6.0~Spidey versus a Power Rangers villan arm Sign in Permalink This movie has some good visual effects, but the story isn't anything new and the Green Goblin is pathetic. I think Mr Raimi must have got a Power Rangers cast-off for that mask. The Batman Joker was so much better as a villan... the green goblin just looked like a tacky merchandising effort... I bet the toys look just like the movie! It could have been worse, but it does not deserve to beat Attack of the Clones...
10.0~Good Movie! aura772 Sign in Permalink When I first saw Spider-Man I was amazed, I never saw a better movie about heroism in my life, how a young man decided that the love for the people should be the first of his priorities and he must not hurt the girl he loves. The only way to not hurt her, was not telling her the truth. Loosing his Uncle Ben was for Peter Parker the worst moment in his life, specially when he founds the thief and starts believing that it was his fault. He had to be his only adviser all the time, as he couldn't afford to loose any of his nearest friends. And the change from a normal human to Spider-Man were weird, specially because he was alone and couldn't tell it to nobody. And as Spider-Man he had to wear a mask all the time, so he couldn't be recognize. His worst fear was that somebody might find out one day, and hurt the people he loves the most. Very good movie, perfect acting it deserved the nominations for the Oscars.
9.0~Exceeded Expectations PeaceDog-1 Sign in Permalink This is an excellent adaptation of the comic. I hope they can get the same cast to return for the sequels. The FX are impressive, and they really did a good job of showing how Parker adapts to his new-found powers. I hope they make the Hulk and the next X-Men in the same way. Marvel is finally making the movies from their bread and butter series, and from the look s of this one, they should keep doing it. Will absolutely see this one again.
6.0~Not all that it is cracked up to be... Cacus7 Sign in Permalink I must first admit that I knew nothing of Spiderman before I saw this movie. So comic book junkies can automatically disregard my review. Seeing this movie as an impartial viewer, I thought that is was entertaining as a fluff piece, but lacked originality. Those who have seen the Superman and Batman series of movies will have already seen practically every element of this movie. I was hoping that Spiderman would provide something original, but was disappointed. And I must add that many of the CGI effects appeared rather fake, quite a drawback for a movie with such a high budget. However, the ending leaves it wide open for a sequel, and I can only hope that the second installment in this series will be better done.
7.0~Good, fast-paced leaving you wanting more zipit Sign in Permalink Once again, Maguire puts in a first rate performance. This was very much in the mold of super-heroes films, being true to the original comics with a feast of special effects and fast action. It is all good-humoured with a great characature baddy. Just what the doctor ordered.
10.0~Amazing movie PeteRoy Sign in Permalink Spiderman is a great story. This movie is very recommended to watch, it has great action scenes, great person moments with interesting events and discoveries. Story of Peter Parker, a good young man, who loves his aunt and uncle, love the next door girl since he was a kid, very smart and not popular in school. Then, because of a special Spider bite he becomes Spiderman, building a custom to make fast money in an arena, wins and doesn't get paid as was promised, he learn the lesson of his life when a thief steals the money from the area manager and he could stop him but doesn't to avenge the manager, then the same thief murders his uncle. 10/10.
2.0~Not a comic book fan! xxcowtowngurl1xx Sign in Permalink Did not like this movie at all because I'm not a comic book fan. I mean i thought the movie was boring and the only good thing was the effects. and I'm being nice. I mean not a fan of Tobey either i mean it made his character too wimpy and sensitive and he really isn't a heart throb to play spider man. I found i was yawning a lot. I mean the villains were good because i like the dark side but i mean this time i did not find the villains to be attractive or sexy or even have any kind of appeal at all! I'm sorry but i own the DVD and i only watched the movie once, sort a like the ring but thats for another review! sorry Tobey you really made me angry and upset after watching you portray spider man in such a disgusting way! no offense to comic book fans because I'm sure you liked the movie
10.0~A great movie - I'll buy the DVD! nashjar Sign in Permalink I just got home from the theater and now can't wait to buy the Spider-man DVD! It was great! Not a dull moment, and the special effects were terrific! Sam Raimi, as usual, peppers the cast with well-known actors in character parts... It's pretty easy to pick Ted Raimi out, but see if you can catch Lucy Lawless (Xena, the Warrior Princess)!! Look closely at the citizens being interviewed about Spidey! Of course, Bruce Campbell makes and appearance, and I knew the voice was familiar, but didn't know who he was until I saw the credits! He was very well disguised! I agree, small children should probably not see this movie. There are some scary parts for youngsters. Avid comic book fans should not be disappointed, as the movie sticks pretty close to the comics, with 1 or 2 forgivable exceptions. Sam marries the right blend of human story with action. I don't believe anyone will leave this movie disappointed!
9.0~Spidey's first thwip onto the big screen is a spectacular wonder huntermartin-75875 Sign in Permalink The time before the era of superheroes. Big Blockbusters were still trying to find a successful formula. Even Star Wars wasn't as successful as it used to be. Sure, movies like Blade and The Punisher came out but those were more aimed at Adults and still gained a bit at the box office but they weren't massive hits. Then in they May of 2002, Average moviegoers would finally see the worlds most amazing, spectacular superhero hit the big screen, spawning a new era of movie's to bust the box office. Directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire as the titular character, Spider-man follows the origin and first real challenge of Peter Parker and his web-slinging alter-ego as he deals with using his powers in normal life, and fighting his first super-villain: the cruel and dastardly villain of "The Green Goblin!" Spider-Man is one of my favorite superhero movies, mainly because it shows the right way to do an origin story. The first time we meet Peter is when he's about to get his powers, putting the viewer into the inciting action right away. After this beginning scene we see Peter's home life and eventually we understand his motivation and his decision to be a good hero when part of that home life is taken away. Despite his age at the time Tobey gives an accurate performance of Peter Parker, and a stellar one as The Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. The best part of this movie though is that it accepts its campiness and silliness as a comic book movie and uses that too it's advantage. This is most definitely best portrayed by Willem Dafoe's performance as Norman Osborne and the Green Goblin, staying a serious, worried, sympathetic businessman and Norman and entirely transforming into a cruel campy disastrous villain as the Goblin. While the characters seem entirely different, Dafoe does a great job linking them together and even makes the Goblin seem like part of who Norman really is. The two of these characters hit their peak at the end of this movie, where we see Norman grieve and regret everything as the Goblin but he realizes it was his fault for it happening in the first place, and Peter learns that you can't save everyone, no matter how hard you try from (of all people) his nemesis. I still believe that while Spider-Man may not be the objective best Superhero movie out there, it is the best at showing what a comic should be in a live action scenario and has a solid lesson to learn. While sure it may not be as Great as Spider-Man 2 or as ridiculous as Spider-man 3, it finds a good balance in it's characters, truly personifies the Amazing, Ultimate, Spectacular Spider-Man, and its influence can still be seen in Superhero movies- and really lots of movies- today, 15 years later.
9.0~great movie carmy29 Sign in Permalink one thing is sure,you have a very good time watching this movie! i loved this movie because the characters are so human,so attaching!!you can really compare yourself to them,even to spider man,aka peter parker. the actors are really nice too.Tobey Maguire is simply perfect and Kirsten Dunst,who plays M.J,is really sweet!! the actions sequences are cool,even if the special effects are much better in "attack of the clones". this movie is also so funny!!! so,to sum up,if you're looking for a movie to have fun,run into the theaters if you haven't done it yet.
10.0~THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST!!!! chubby_cheeks24 Sign in Permalink I have watched this movie in the theaters about 7 times and i am still not bored of it. THIS IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD!!!!! i really recommend this movie 2 everyone! It is so good, you have to watch it again and again and again! it is SO good!
8.0~Perfect Combination shahmonster Sign in Permalink Story, SFX, character development: all nicely done. It also had some really amusing scenes like the wrestle-match with Bonesaw McGraw & when PP first tests out his spider-powers. The scene on the Old Glory flagpole at the end had a classic "arachnid" pose & was in my mind the killer shot of the movie. Overall very high on the cool-factor, and a great underplayed & nuanced performance from Tobey.
6.0~Willem Defoe makes this movie threeravensfly Sign in Permalink I went to see this to simply have a good time and eat some really expensive popcorn. What I got was a really good time, and the absolute pleasure of watching Willem Defoe put on an absolutely amazing preformance. There is no question that I would pay the same ridiculous ticket price again to see his performance again. The man just steals every movie that he's allowed to act in. If someone is looking for great character acting, one needs look no further.
8.0~Decent flick. Not a classic, unfortunately... panduh Sign in Permalink This wasn't a bad flick by any means. Lots of action, and special effects (many of the f/x was "fakey" but I was willing to let it go, because it was probably the best they could do with current technology.) The film had relatively good pacing and the writing stayed true to the original Spiderman "mythology". However, the film doesn't do too good of a job of detailing relationships very well. Peter Parker and Mary Janes relationship feels artificial, as well as the friendship between Harry Osbourne and Peter Parker. The "romantic" scenes between MacGuire and Dunst were also VERY, VERY cheesy. The scene in the hospital where Tobey kind of expresses his feelings for Mary Jane was bordering on "groan-out-loud" bullpuckey, as was MacGuire's final monologue at the end of the movie. Another major problem I had was with Spiderman's personality. I've never been a big fan of Spiderman comics, but the one thing I liked about the character of Spiderman was that he was a joker -- a wiseass. He would always make funny observations or pointed insults whenever he was fighting a villain, and that made him human. MacGuire plays him too straight, and in the end, Spiderman feels boring. He actually is TOO geeky for the role. Yeah, Peter Parker is supposed to be a nerd, but he also had a sparkling personality, and I think that was lost in this film. In any event, the film was exciting. I was never bored. I would have liked to see Spidey more crime-fighting, instead of the "montage" of him thwarting petty burglars, but it felt "empty". It didn't feel like Spiderman really did much for the city (unlike, say Superman or Batman did in their respective movies.) But again, I was never bored and the action was enough to warrant the price I paid for the ticket.
10.0~I'm caught in the web! monicaprince Sign in Permalink The movie was fantastic! I will admit that I am no avid comic book fanatic, but seeing Spiderman in action on film was nothing short of a great thrill ride. I especially liked the part where the Green Goblin was enticing a dazed Spiderman to join him in his evil wiles. Tobey Maguire made Peter Parker vulnerable and yet strong at the same time. His acting was superb. I also like James Franco and can't wait to see him again as he plants his revenge on Spiderman. HELP! I willing got myself caught in the web of Spiderman!!!
1.0~unexpected ending SPOILER daurenn Sign in Permalink As a person absolutely not familiar with comics and judging by what I saw on a screen only, I couldn't find any reasonable explanation of the spiderman's behavior in the last scene where he refuses love of Mary Jane. IMHO That movie is not worth any good comments.
7.0~It's No Superman Or Batman, But It Ain't Bad! ccthemovieman-1 Sign in Permalink I enjoyed watching this on DVD a lot more than seeing it at the theater. I also enjoyed the sequel a lot more than this movie, although this has its moments if you can get past the stupid teen romance. The latter is especially unneeded and overdone at the end of the movie. Willem Dafoe is an interesting villain and a decent choice for the role since his resume is dotted with strange characters over the years. One wonders if he - like Johnny Depp - ever plays a "normal" person. This film is very good in the sound effects department if you have a surround system. That was one reason I enjoyed it more at home. Big screens make you lose sharpness in a film, too. Tobey Maguire plays a likable "Peter Potter" (Spiderman) while Kristen Dunst is annoying as girlfriend "Mary Jane Watson." It was kind of interesting to see '60s movie-TV star Cliff Robertson again, as Peter's "Uncle Ben." This is not up to Superman or Batman standards, but it will do for a diversionary two hours of super-hero fun. It still entertains, which is the whole idea of it in the first place.
8.0~Marvel FINALLY gets it right mcquestion Sign in Permalink I've read a lot of comments on the Spider-Man film, now I add my own. First and foremost, I deem this movie to be a complete success on almost every level. Toby Maguire as Peter Parker? But of course! I also laughed when I saw him introduced for the first time, but no more. What were we wanting? Christopher Reeve? Parker is thin and short. He's NOT 6 foot 4 and 200 pounds. He's a geek. The guy IS Peter Parker. Kirsten Dunst is fantastic and sexy as Mary Jane Watson. Willem Dafoe is one of my favorite actors since The Last Temptation Of Christ, and other than his the corny scenes where he has dialogue with himself he's completely believable as Norman Osborne. I've read comments on this very board that Sam Raimi "failed on very level" and "betrayed everything the comics were about." Did we see the same film? The movie is comprised of a storyline torn straight from the most classic comic storylines from the death of Uncle Ben to the finale on the Brooklyn Bridge where The Goblin drops MJ (rather than Gwen Stacy as it was in the comics). The effects were seamless except for in one shot where Spidey uses the slingshot, that's pretty rubbery and fake looking I admit, but otherwise you really get the idea that this guy is in freefall throughout the city before shooting out a web and zipping to another location almost faster than the eye can see. As for the human element of the story, check out the backyard talk between MJ and Peter late at night if you don't think it's not chalk full of character moments. After screwing up time and again at attempts to get their characters on the screen (see the Captain America movie or the Punisher film), Marvel FINALLY got it right. Congratulations, Spidey, it's great to have you back. On the minus side, the film's score sucked royally. Danny Elfman (of MIB and Batman fame) gives us a score devoid of identity and identifiable moments. Elfman is in an official slump after this film and Planet Of The Apes. no comic book to movie adaptation has been truer to the source material and IMO it even surpasses the original X-Men. Both Star Wars II and X-Men II have BIG shoes to fill when they come out.
7.0~Great version of a Marvel Hero pjm911 Sign in Permalink I came back to this after watching the latest incarnation (which is some alternate universe PC crap that has no bearing on the entire history of Spider-man) and it remains a good onscreen rendition of the Spidey we know and love. It has aged well and will be on my watch list in the future, I'll save Homecoming for when I am not home and I want to get even with the cat.
10.0~OH MY GOD James Felix Sign in Permalink I've been reading comics for 30 years now, and Spider-Man is not the best comic-book based film I've ever seen. It's the best film I've ever seen, PERIOD. It may not win an Oscar, it may not be Citizen Kane, but it is the hands down most fun I've ever, ever had in a theater, and isn't that what we all pay our eight bucks for? Lots of people directed lots of criticism towards Sam Raimi as rumor after rumor surfaced during production. Well, Mr. Raimi has just delivered the perfect comeback to anything his detractors have to say, and that is a magnificent film. Managing to be both modern and faithful to it's 40 year old source material, it is solid fun from start to finish. I simply cannot say enough good things about this film.
10.0~=) CrystalBlueSilver Sign in Permalink This movie was awesome. I came into the theater expecting an o.k. film, but it was much more than that. Now any die-hard comic book fan knows about Peter Parker and all his foes and adversaries, but I had no idea, save for what my comic-obsessed bro told me (which wasn't much). I sat in the theater and was immersed in that movie. It was like I wasn't even in the theater (it helped that we were in the front seat). Wow. I will definately be watching out for the sequel (and there hasta be one)
10.0~Simply the best comic-based movie EVER! AtlantaAEguy Sign in Permalink I must admit that I was a little skeptical at first. Sam Raimi as the director? I was expecting James Cameron. Tobey Maguire? Willem DaFoe? Kirsten Dunst? Oh come on! Then I saw the movie. I was wrong. Sam Raimi was brilliant - he created the best live-action adaptation of a comic book that I have ever seen! Tobey Maguire was very convincing as both Peter Parker AND Spiderman. Kirsten Dunst played Mary Jane very well, and Willem DaFoe was a marvelous Green Goblin. With rumors flying about a second and possibly third installment in a series of Spiderman movies, I find myself very excited. If you enjoyed the likes of Batman and Superman movies, you will LOVE Spiderman!
8.0~Pretty good jessie-8 Sign in Permalink I thought it would be a lot better than it is although it is really good not what i expected.I went to see it because of its great reviews and im a fan of kirsten dunsts. Definately worth seeing 7/10
8.0~The best "Spiderman" film by far. alexanderdavies-99382 Sign in Permalink This was the film that proved an adaptation of a "Marvel Comic" superhero could be made. This first "Spiderman" film was the first of its kind and set the course for all future superhero movies. There is a story that actually holds the film together and backed by some good dialogue, good directing and pretty good acting. Where better than to begin with the origins of Spiderman? As has been depicted many times, high school student Peter Parker is bitten by a spider that just happens to be radioactive during a guided tour of a New York science museum. Initially overcome by his newly acquired superpowers, Parker attempts to cash in by appearing as a wrestler and on prime time television. After all this is met with failure, disaster strikes as Parkers Uncle Ben is murdered in cold blood by a thief. Cliff Robertson was brilliantly cast as the uncle. The story doesn't just revolve around Spiderman/Peter Parker though. Elsewhere in the film, business tycoon and inventor Norman Osborn (well played by Willam Defoe), suffers from an accident in his own laboratory after an experiment goes wrong. Thus the Green Goblin is unleashed. I was a bit disappointed with the costume for the Green Goblin, it held none of the appeal or chilling factor that the comic books had. Peter Parker struggles with his growing feelings for the girl that he has liked since childhood - Mary Jane Watson. The task of expressing his feelings has been rendered even more difficult on account of his crime- fighting alter ego. Toby Maguire is pretty good in the main role but I wouldn't exactly call him a heavyweight actor. He can't project the rugged look that action men need. Even so, he fits the bill. The scenes that show Spiderman web-slinging his way around New York look great and the CGI serves its purpose without compromising the story. A great film and its box office success is well deserved.
8.0~Where is the glibness? kinetica Sign in Permalink Great rendering of a childhood comic. But Toby must get some lightness of being. Peter Parker is a nerd, and he uses his smart aleck remarks to keep his morale up as EVERYTHING assaults his very being... the cost of being an imperfect hero. I love spider-man far more than Superman and Batman... The only characters i like more are Women heroes and the Thing and Nexus. The way Spidey ALWAYS takes to himself, outloud, but quietly, bolstering his beleagured spirit is great. Most of my humor derives from the comic, but the movie lacks that---- which is very weird as it was done by Sam Raimi, who delved into silly almost once a week with hercules and zena, but his humor does not shine through in the scripted words for Toby, thus lowering my expectations for any sequels and earning no more than a 7.
7.0~A decent beginning to the summer blockbuster season. flicklover Sign in Permalink I will start by saying that I have never been a Spiderman fan, I have always been partial to Superman and Batman. But I'm always open to a comic book hero brought to the big screen. Sam Raimi has made a movie that I feel will appeal to most people, it is fun, brisk, and never takes itself too seriously. Toby Maguire is good as Peter Parker/Spiderman. He brings the appropriate sensibility to his role, Willem Dafoe does what he can with what he is given as the Green Goblin, but it is too little, I wish they would have fleshed out his villainous character. The special effects are good, but I believe that they are intentionally cheesy. The action scenes are done well, but nothing that hasn't been seen before.If there is a problem is exactly that, the action is not particularly unique, the scenes are done well but there isn't really any memorable shots or things that the audience would be wowed by. I would say that the non action stuff in the movie is more entertaining. The first hour when Peter is discovering his powers is especially entertaining. So a slightly above average warm up to the summer season, a good warm up for Episode II. Grade: B-
7.0~More than I expected Castor T-2 Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi was really a great director, an almost revolutionary innovator with the Evil Dead series and the author of an excellent noir like A Simple Plan, but in other cases (for example the last one starring Kevin "Stinky" Costner) he was very disappointing. So my expectations for Spider-Man were very low (I'm a die-hard batmanian!!). But, sometimes it happens again, the movie was better than I thought. In particular the first half, in my opinion the part that really interested Raimi: the developing of the mutation as a metaphor of Peter Parker's hormonal developing. Or a brilliant idea like the wrestling one to explain the use of a costume, necessary for a superhero but unusual in real life. The second half is more directed with the auto pilot, with the usual topics of comics movie (kidnapping of the girl, hero versus his nemesis, ecc.), but it doesn't diminish the good impression left by the first one. A last positive mention for Tobey Maguire and a negative one for Willem Dafoe (he is really overacting!) and the special effects, sometimes too evident. But it's better to do so, less accurate special effects and more attention to the screenplay, the exact opposite of the slaughter committed by Lucas to one of our favorite series (guess what?)
10.0~A fantastic film, pure and simple. nickpowell Sign in Permalink Move over Superman, X-Men and Howard the Duck......Spiderman is here !! Although I'm usually sceptical about comic translations I was thrilled to see that Spiderman has been made without losing the essential character of Peter Parker ! Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst complimented each other perfectly and the result is something that is bound to please audiences both young and old. Oh...and buy the soundtrack as well. Tracks 2, 17, 18 & 19 kick ass !
10.0~Great Movie bianca_anne Sign in Permalink This movie brings you into the scene and literally makes your jaw drop. If you are a spiderman fan of many years or are just getting into the hype this movie will make you smile, laugh, and feel good. Great date movie, great family movie. It will make you want to see it again - even if you have to, once again, wait in a long line. A+++++++
10.0~Incredible!! kippardue_luvr21 Sign in Permalink I would have to say that 'Spider-man' was better than all the Batman movies, Superman, and all the other comic hero movies combined! The visual effects were unbelievable and amazing! It is an incredible movie adapted from the comic book. It is also a movie that all ages, children through seniors, can enjoy. I hope the future hold sequels to this masterpiece! Oh by the way, the soundtrack is killer too! It's got great songs from Sum 41, The Strokes, Alien Ant Farm, Default, and of course, the Spider-man theme performed by the greatest, Aerosmith!
2.0~Lame. Waste of my time. usa-2 Sign in Permalink What a waste of money and time making such a lame movie. I wasted my time, however, watching it thinking it had to get better. Multiple mistakes made in the production. The good news - - I did not pay anything to watch it as the DVD was loaned to me! The movie was rated much higher than it deserves. Most of the higher votes must have come from the younger viewers. The Green Goblin is what made the movie weak. The movie would have been better if the Green Goblin had been "grounded". Every flying scene with the Goblin weakened the movie.
7.0~Definitely a fun movie. Not necessarily a good movie though. loramer Sign in Permalink This movie was amazingly fun to watch and had a lot of good laughs and great action scenes. But, as much as I enjoyed the movie, there were some aspects that really bugged me. The worst of which was the clunky dialouge (the hospital scene in particular). If you were one of the thousands that were annoyed by Star Wars: Episode I's dialouge, then you will most likely have the same problems with the dialouge that I had. If you don't understand why I don't like the dialouge in either movie, then consider yourself lucky not to have noticed. My other main problem was that some of the effects looked like I could have done a better job using photoshop on a Mac. The scenes in particular that i am speaking of are the scenes in which Peter Parker is jumping from building to building in his plain clothes (near the begining) and the scene at the end with MJ hanging on the cable and getting tossed around like a rag doll after the Green Goblin makes his pass. Both of these scenes, along with the clunky dialouge, took me out of the fantasy world that was created around me and reminded me that I was just watching a movie. All in all, the rest of the film is done very well, and there are wonderful performances by Tobey MacGuire, Kirsten Dunst (I normally have really big problems with her performances, but this time she outdid herself), and Willem DaFoe. Another notable performance was J.K. Simmons, who plays teh part of J. Jonah Jameson perfectly, and I must say that I really enjoyed his scenes. I would suggest going to see this movie to anyone that wants to be entertained and have a good time, but still don't think it's going to win any awards.
6.0~A bit corny at some scenes but pretty good overall mOVIemAN56 Sign in Permalink When I first saw Spider-Man I had a good time and walked away happy. But now after seeing it again last night on TV I'm a bit disappointed. Spider-Man is the story based of a comic book about Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), a nerd living in New York, being bitten by a genetically altered spider and receiving special, spider powers from it. While Parker deals with his new found powers he must deal with the growing menace of the Green Goblin who may very-well turn out to be closer to him then he could ever imagine. The film is visually stunning with Spider-Man swinging through New York and some special-effects. But as the visuals and effects triumph some weak story-telling and little character developments hit the film hard. The whole film I felt that Mary Jane Watson(Kristen Dunst) was a complete waste and just ridiculous when all of a sudden a complete stranger is helping her and the very next scene she's making out with him. Tobey Maguire is pretty tough and pretty cool. He brought out the real dorky side needed to make Peter Parker a successful character. Above all Willem Dafoe (Norman Osborn/Green Goblin)and J.K. Simmons (J. Johan Jameson)was excellent. All the actors acted pretty well and brought a sense of feeling to there characters. I don't blame Dunst entirely for the weak job as Watson, I just always imagined her being just a bit smarter (ex: she begins to walk down a back alley in the pouring rain at midnight not expecting to encounter any trouble) and having more of a role then just being the love connection to Parker. Another problem was why they made the Green Goblin out to be the villain. With all of the great villains in Spider-Man comics (ex: Venom and Electro) they choose the Green Goblin. they did follow what the Green Goblin did in the comics but it would have been a lot cooler if Venom had been the villain. Venom was just awesome and truly frightened me as a kid. But Spider-Man brought back the genre of super hero films and Spider-Man 2 turned out to be one of the best super hero films made. Spider-Man isn't a bad film but it does get pretty corny at some scenes including the fight scene along the bridge. But the acting is strong and Willem Dafoe brings it from me not recommending it. Spider-Man. Starring: Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, Kristen Dunst,James Franco, and Rosemary Harris. 3 out of 5 Stars.
8.0~A good and entertaining comic book adaptation ramstar22 Sign in Permalink Spider Man is another good movie in the new string of comic book films. Everything about this film is good. From the acting to the visual effects and action sequences, it never slows down or becomes tiresome. The plot is about a nerdy highschool kid who is transformed into a superhero after being bitten by a genetically altered spider. With his new powers he must stop the evil Green Goblin while hiding his love for his neighbor Mary Jane. The acting is better than one can expect for a comic book based film. Toby Maguire does a terrific job at being a nerdy kid who has little confidence and is in love with his longtime childhood friend. Without him in the movie, it would have been a routine action film. The other actors did fair jobs at their performance, but they were nothing special. Willem Dafoe did a pretty good job at the Green Goblin, and he did what he could to make him sinister and disturbed. The talented Kirsten Dunst also did a fine job as Mary Jane, but she didn't have to be saved by Spider-Man three times. The visual effects were not as bad as I thought they were going to be. They were better than most and they were able to show Spider-Man swinging through the city. The only objections that I had about them is that at most times you can tell when the images are CGI, they sometimes look like cartoons, and there is no weight to Spider-Man when he is leaping of swinging, but they are still exciting effects to view. Overall, this is a very good action/adventure popcorn movie that delivers in evert aspect. With Toby Maguire's good performance, exciting visual effects and action scenes, and an accurate transfer to the big screen from the comic book, this is a good and entertaining comic book adaptation.
10.0~I thought it was the best thing since sliced bread leach Sign in Permalink I thought the movie did the comic justice. I had some really good action parts and just followed the comic real well. I was really unsure about Tobey Maguire playing Spiderman, but I think after watching it, I see he did an excellent job, and I just can't wait till Spiderman 2 comes out.
9.0~Spectacular and Amazing Jbean769 Sign in Permalink Wow, where should I start...First of all the film stays incredibly close to the comic book story, (there are a few tweaks, but they add to the character) which is a good basic root for the nerdy kid to achieve storyline with good versus evil mixed in. Toby Maguire is the perfect Peter Parker with his small frame and intelligent looks, Kirsten Dunst simply does a good job acting and of course her sweet looks adds a nice touch and as for Dafoe, he is a villain that gets very close to Jack Nicholson's Joker, if only the Green Goblin's mask would show more of his facial expressions. The one actor which really made his character shine was J.K. Simmons as Daily Bugal Chief J. Jonah Jameson...he had it down all the way. Simply put, I am not going to ruin this film by giving too much away, it should be watched on the BIG screen...Can't wait for Spidey II.
7.0~Good, but Amazing...? amrten Sign in Permalink On the whole I liked Spider-Man. It was good escapist fun. Where my disappointment in the movie lies is that the film makers were so close to making the movie smart and serious, as well as action packed and entertaining, but for my money, they backed out on the smart and serious at the last minute. What was left in made me want more of it. The actors were having emotional responses, but the film makers forgot to connect the audience to what was going on. That's just BAD. I would have even been willing to sacrifice one or two of the action sequences for a little more plot and character development, so that I cared about the characters. I think that Hollywood has forgotten that they can still make a movie that appeals to the kids that is smart enough and engaging enough to keep the adults interested as well (take a lesson from The Simpsons, which appeals on so many levels and works for young and old alike). Not everyone has Attention Deficit Disorder. But sadly, Hollywood will look at the Box Office receipts and say if it ain't broke.... I was so disappointed when I looked up on the screen and said "oh well, it is after all only a Comic Book." I am happy for Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. They are incredible young actors and the future of the movies for the next decade. They deserve to get this big pay day, and they still were able to give emotionally rich and inspired performances, in spite of everything else. I hope that they won't loose sight of there talent. Possible spoilers!!! although, I may be the last person in America to have seen this movie, so I don't know who I would be spoiling it for. Being from New York, and at the World Trade Center on September 11th, it was a little disturbing to see the sequence where the Green Goblin attacks the Oscorp Headquarters and pieces of the building were falling on top of police cars and crushing them. I realize that this was more than likely filmed before the events of the 11th, and I am not one to be hyper-sensitive about this if it were an integral part of the movie, but it was at most a one or two second piece of film. Would it have killed the editors to have cut that out? Also, although I have felt very patriotic during this time, was the final sequence with the large American Flag appropriate? I kind of feel that although it was well meaned, it came across a little on the exploitative side.
10.0~This Movies Puts in the "Amazing" in the "Amazing Spider Man"! SpideyJedi Sign in Permalink On opening night-Friday, I went to see Spider~Man with my mom and step-sister. Never in my life have I been this hyped up to see a movies- and better yet, get to see my favorite comic book hero come to life on the big screen. The theater was jamed packed. It was almost impossible to get tickets, until we got lucky with the last theater. It brought a tear to my eye to see so much Spider~Man patriotism!!! For you who have never read the comic, and don't know diddily-squat about Spider~Man, have no fear. This movies is fit for Spider~Man comic book readers, and non-Spider~Man comic book readers. The movie is in my opinion, in depth, realistic, and just too cool. Yet it strictly stays to the plots, so it doesn't bore you. Instead of having a man in black spandex, a cap, and pointy bat ears who's naturally and physically capable of kicking anyone's tail in (with the help of a high-tech vehicle)we have Peter Parker. A soon-to-be Highschool graduate, nerd, and lowdown in the faces of his peers(for the exception of a couple). He's small in frame, but has a big mind. Peter Parker loves the girl next door, and has a rich boy for a best friend. It seems all of us can relate to Peter in some way, yet look to him like a real hero. When Peter Parker becomes "Your friendly neighborhood Spider~Man" or the "Amazing Spider~Man" his personal life as a "normal" young man doesn't change his social status. Even though it carries a PG-13 rating, I'd say this movie is slightly suitable for nearly all ages. Towards the end when Spider~Man fights the Green Goblin, it'll probably terrify a 6 year old. The younger ones might hate the kissing scenes, but anyone can love Spider~Man's heroic moments. This movie was definitely worth my time, and I plan to see it 1,000 more times in theaters, and watch it more than 1,000 times when it comes on video. If you've been dying to see this movie, you'll go home satisfied. If you hate comics, hate super-heroes, and just don't care to see Spider~Man, hopefully you'll have a change of heart. But you've wasted your time if you go home grumpy. I've given this movie a 10 out of 10. To me, this is the best film I've seen! I can't wait for the future Spider~Man films. Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire were the perfect picks. The graphics were amazing, the acrobatics and form of Spider~Man were perfect to the comic, and the acting was AMAZING!!! You couldn't pick a better cast. !!!!!!!!!!!!!SPIDER~MAN RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5.0~Spider-Man has nothing on Batman apowersdmb Sign in Permalink I was one of the first people to catch Spider-Man fever. I have always been a fan of Spider-Man since an early age and when I found out the the movie was actually going to happen I was psyched. Seeing the previews I was blown away. The costume looked great and you can't beat the Green Goblin as a villain. Going into the theater last Friday was great. There was a huge buzz and everyone was geared up. Everything was going as I had expected...then the movie began. At first I fought off the obvious on screen actions because the story of Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man had to be told, but it got old really quickly. The corny one liners were too much to take. The Green Goblin's costume looked like a really good Halloween costume. The way Spider-Man and the Goblin interacted was painful. It was like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I really think the 5 year old behind me had a better time than I did. He was laughing at the funny parts...what does that tell you? I really think this could have been a marketing ploy for Marvel. I see it has pleased long time Spider-Man fans due to the 186 ranking it already has on this web site, but I am not one of those. The sequel better be a big improvement. Going into the theater I was expecting Michael Keaton's Batman, but in the end I got Adam West's. My advice: Wait for the rental.
4.0~What is the big deal? Necro Joe Sign in Permalink What is the big deal about this movie? I had VERY low expectations for this film. I will admit that it was better than I expected it to be, but it is not by any means a great film. The highlight of the film is Willem Dafoe. He plays the perfect villain. Kirsten Dunst delivers a decent performance as well. And at least it didn't have a predictable ending. Now I realize that a bunch of you comic book lovers are probably going to send me a bunch of hate mail after reading my review, but so what. I agree with Roger Ebert's review of this movie. It's not very believeable, original, or all that enlightening either. Plus I don't like comic books. I leave you with this question: Where does Tobey MacGuire's Spider-Man costume come from. He made the one for the wrestling match that looked like something his mom made for him when he was 8 on Halloween. The next time you see him with his costume, it looks like it was custom-made by a professional Hollywood costume designer. No explanation. And it aggravates me. I give this one a 4/10
10.0~Cool Movie ssportsguy2001 Sign in Permalink Spider Man is the #1 on my Top 25 movies list. The first time I saw this movie I thought Tobey McGuire (aka Spider Man) did really good. This movie is one of my favorites. So I would give it a 9 out of 10 star. Willem Dafoe did a good job at being the Green Goblin.
10.0~Single-handedly The Greatest Comic-Movie Ever. Flannel-Man Sign in Permalink Peter's narration at the beginning sets the stage for the tale of high-school woes... of the little guy being picked on... of the woman he loves and the people he fears. This movie makes you care about Peter Parker before you ever give two hoots about Spider-Man. I laughed with the audience at the awkward way Peter handled his web-slinging, early on. I genuinely cried when Uncle Ben died. This movie, though seemingly fast-paced (in story), makes you feel for so many of the characters... even Harry, who just wants someone to love him. The story isn't Amazing Fantasy #15 (the original tale), it's an amazing fantasy about a science geek, a pretty girl next-door, a controlling business man gone mad, and his lonely son, and the loss of loved ones. While I love the action, the effects, and Spider-Man himself--this movie succeeds in the simple tale of the hero we'd all be if we had the super-powers and the spandex. This is one of the best films ever.
9.0~I saw this opening day, and the crowd loved it. Yello Sign in Permalink I openly cheered. There is something to be said about seeing a movie on opening day. I bought my ticket for the 12:15 show, and my watch already said 12:19. So, I missed half of one preview. I was simply using this as a crutch to tide me over until Star Wars Episode II opened, but this movie totally rocked! The acting was great, the special effects were cool. The costumes were terrific. Go see this one at the theater. Don't put it off until it comes out on video.
9.0~Great! crawdidd424 Sign in Permalink This movie was pretty good. It is not what I would call a good movie. It had a great plot line, but the movie seemed to be made very cheaply. The graphics sucked, terribly. For an example when Pete was running on the buildings, that was some of the worst CGIs I have ever seen. It takes place when Peter Parker is in High School, and while at a field trip to a local science center, where they are doing experiments on spiders one ends up missing. The spider bites Pete on the hand. The next morning he wakes up with powers. " With great powers comes great responsibilities." Peter eventually moves to the city with his best friend and gets a job taking pictures of spider man. Peter ends up running into his old friend Mary Jane. He finds out she is in town he becomes her bodyguard. Overall this is a pretty good movie I accidentally gave it a ten, but really it should only be as eight because of the horrible graphics.
5.0~***3/10*** "aN HoNeST To GoD DiSaPoiNTMeNT" framer94 Sign in Permalink Despite the hype to this film, it wasn't all that it's cracked upto to be. Columbia went through a heck of alot of caRe and expenditure to make sure that the movie was advertised as extensively as possible to ensure it's box office hits. I listened to the soundtrack before I seen tne movie and had hoped to what I was expecting to be an worthy equal to that of Tim Burton's Batman, the more recent X-MEN movie. And considering it was coming from teh view of Sam Raimi (director of the previously banned Evil Dead, Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn), I expected so much more. The writers didn't seem to get it, that theres as much adults who liek Spiderman as there is kids. Not forgetting that it's based on a 35 year old + superhero. The action sequences score high, and I liked the way they adapted the Green Goblin's form into that of an electronic flight-suit instead of Green Rubber spandex, but there's too much of a love interest, and the story is written accordingly to the origional Green Goblin story, which is a spoiler for the sort of people who live and breave these comics die-hard. The whole story is just 99% predicatble. Who hasn't seen an American superhero movie that they had sussed from the opening. It's an honest to God disapointment, and a real pitty, because a title like Spiderman had the pottential to go as far as Batman did in 1989, had the script been giving good looking at. The writers rushed this script, as theve done with the sequel to this, which is supposed to feature 'Doctor Octopus.' OK for a watch, but doesn't attempt to appeal to people over 13. ***3/10***
8.0~Actually an incredibly written movie. kylekazooie Sign in Permalink I first saw Spider-man as a 7 year old kid, and obviously I enjoyed it. I flogged the crap out of our VHS copy, so much so I think the tape started to deteriorate. But of course I liked it when I was 7, it was a Spider-man movie! However, unlike a lot of things I liked at 7, this movie holds up incredibly well. In matter of fact it actually gets better every time I re watch it. The casting, the acting, the practical and CG effects, the direction, they all stand up as still being fantastic after 12 years. But it's the focus of the script that really makes this movie so fantastic. The film, at its most simple, is about Peter and MJ. It's also about Peter becoming aware of the responsibility to use his powers for good. This film is so focused because it knows what its focus IS. This is why 2012 SM is so bad (imo). It seems to decide that its story arc is that of Peter's parents, but that fizzles out after 20 minutes. It seems the sequel will try and pull this story back in, but its importance just wasn't explored properly in the first film. Instead it got distracted and copied 2002s central plot with the love story. Which they obviously needed to do but could have focused on much less, as I mentioned, they have Peter's parents to focus on. 2002 SM didn't! All there was to explore was Peter and MJ and it executed it perfectly. Even the sequel handled these ideas well. MJ and Peter finally end up together and Peter begins to question his responsibility to be a hero. The third could have made a prefect trilogy; the ingredients are in there. Peter's dark side is exposed and he himself becomes the villain. Peter's actions causing MJ fear and ultimately stop loving Peter is a tragic end to the tale, but it's perfect because of that tragedy. Sadly this all got muddled up with too many extra villains and unfocused execution. ANYWAY, Spider-man is a fantastically written movie! 10/10! (or more, 8/10!)
9.0~spider sotocornejo_juan Sign in Permalink He must catch a flight and she must get on the train in the morning. They have 14 hours together in Vienna. That is the entirety of the plot. They get into arguments, they kiss, they listen to music and get coffee and acquire a bottle of wine and get their fortune read and have a poem written on their behalf. They simply exist in Vienna as a couple (first friends, then romantically) even though when they woke up that morning they hadn't met. Hawke plays his part as a typical American. He doesn't know any other languages which is something that is alluded to on occasion. He doesn't let fantasy enter his life. He's cynical because of past relationships. Delpy is flighty and tough-acting, but just as vulnerable as any other 23-year-old who doesn't know where she's going. She swears and gets angry. She is exactly what we think a young French woman is like (or maybe what we hope one is like). Both actors are on screen the entire time. It's basically a moving two-perso
6.0~Shame it's a kids film lazy_loonatic Sign in Permalink This could have been a better film, but because it's meant to be a goodish influence on kids, the producers had to stuff it full of morals, and 'good over evil' stuff. I know some people will think it helps the story, and it does in a way, but for me it's far too predictable. If it wasn't a film for kids, it could have had an element of black comedy of some darker twists, and that would have improved it greatly. But for me, it was merely an average film that i wouldn't bother seeing again. Overall I would give the film 6 out of 10. I also wouldn't let younger children watch it without parents, as some of the best bits (the violent fight scenes) definitely aren't suitable for young kids.
8.0~Spider-Man is loads of fun! wiholke2020 Sign in Permalink Spider-Man has gone through a lot over the years and especially in the 2000's. This film is directed by Sam Raimi and was the first movie in a very popular comic book movie trilogy that exploded in the box office. This was easily one of MARVEL's best films at the time and let me tell you. In 2017, a lot of scenes really hold up well. If you have not yet seen this movie, first of all, go watch it, and second, I am going to be talking about this movie in detail so you have been warned. The movie begins and automatically I love the score. Danny Elfman did a superb job composing my favorite Spider-Man theme so far. The opening credits, while being long, really prepare you for this awesome comic book ride you are about to go on and yes a lot of scenes are very cheesy. Even the opening credits are cheesy. The dialogue begins with Peter Parker, played by Tobey McGuire, narrating. Right off the bat you feel very sorry for Peter as he is without a doubt bullied in many ways in this movie. The only people who seem to care are MJ, played by Kirsten Dust, and Harry Osborne, played by James Franco. In this film, Peter has a large crush on MJ, which was handled very well. The dialogue they share together in this movie work 100%. It was very relatable. When I first saw this movie I had a massive crush on a girl and I really understood Peter's feelings and emotions which makes Peter Parker in this movie more likable. The scene where he gets bitten by the spider actually holds up very well. It's very dramatic and the cinematography is very good. He comes home from his field trip after he was bitten and we meet Aunt May and Uncle Ben. In my opinion, this is perfect casting and these two are brilliant. So far they are my favorite Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Peter is feeling very sick and he looks very pale. The spider bite on his hand has swollen up and looks very disgusting but it makes his transformation that much cooler. We also get introduced to Norman Osborne, played by William Dafoe. He was a good actor throughout the movie, but his voice acting sometimes suffered, not to mention his Green Goblin suit is Power Ranger-like. The costumes in the movie elsewhere are completely fine but this suit just seemed to lack. When Peter becomes Spider-Man, this movie really starts to get fun. It's very funny, cheesy of course, but very good set pieces when he climbs his first wall. And yes, he has organic web shooters which I am totally fine with. He got the powers of a spider, why can't he shoot webs? It makes sense to me. And the sound mixing for the webs are iconic and very good. The wrestling scene is very good and very funny, which leads to Uncle Ben's death, which was very emotional and one of the best scenes in this movie, and right away you feel for Peter and you are rooting for Peter. I love the car chase right after, and the fight in the abandoned building is brilliant film making with the lack of music and lighting. From here on out Spider-Man is awesome, but also cheesy like the comic books. In fact, some of the dialogue with Spider-Man and Green Goblin are lines straight from the books. And I got to say my least favorite scene in this movie is the first action scene with Spidey and the Green Goblin. It is very cheesy, kind of cliché, and the CGI doesn't hold up well in that scene. However, Green Goblin gets really cool when he learns Peter is Spider-Man. He breaks into Aunt May's home and May is taken to the hospital which is a very well directed scene and one of the better scenes with the Green Goblin. And of course, the abandoned hospital scene is beautifully directed in terms of almost everything! The lack of music, lighting, costumes and stunts it's all very good! Spider- Man's suit gets so worn and ripped it's very good visual art. This movie ends on a very good note and yes a lot of scenes hold up well. Yes it's cheesy. Yes, CGI is a bit dated and the Green Goblin looks like a Power Ranger we get it. But this movie is loads of fun and a must see.
10.0~Woo hoo! No disappointment here! mhamlyn421 Sign in Permalink As a die-hard Spiderman fan since I was about 6, I was approaching this movie with some skepticism, especially given some pretty terrible comic book inspired movies (Captain America, The Punisher). I take it ALL back without hesitation. This was excellent, stayed true to the spirit of the Spiderman story, and the small changes that were made fit well in the story, making for a thoroughly enjoyable film. Great performances all around. Drop whatever you're doing right now and go and see it.
10.0~Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man thesimpsonsstuff-74998 Sign in Permalink Tobey Maguire is very excellent, he gets bitten by a spider and then he has spider superpowers. He spins his web out of the hand that got bitten by the spider. But Willem Dafoe tries to kill Rosemary Harris and Kirsten Dunst. But without Cliff Robertson, Peter Parker has to fight Green Goblin. We also have James Franco as Harry Osborn, the son of Oscorp owner Norman Osborn. I like the film, with J.K Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, the boss of the Daily Bugle. We also have Elizabeth Banks as Jameson's secretary. And many more. I rate this film 10 out of 10. It's my favourite film, of course, some people still watch it. Tobey Maguire is good looking, with his blue eyes. Kirsten Dunst looks fabulous, with her red hair. Willem Dafoe is brilliant, with the good side and the evil side. J.K Simmons is excellent, although he thinks Spiderman is a menace.
7.0~Mediocre GotWookiee Sign in Permalink I have to say I was a pleasantly surprised by Spider-Man. I've never really like movies based on comic books, other than Tim Burton's Batman (1989) and the Superman films with Christopher Reeve. Spider-Man was much better than I had anticipated. It had some really wonderful action scenes, not just hard-pounding, visceral thrill-rides, but scenes that really excited you and made you wanna stand up and shout "Go get 'em, Spider-Man!" It thankfully didn't score the action sequences with the latest "rock music" like The Matrix did. Sam Ramai definately made some effort to not make Spider-Man as dated as The Matrix will be in 10-20 years. Tobey Maguire and William Dafoe have always been excellent actors. I really like Maguire's performance in Cider House Rules. But beyond that, the acting was wooden, especially in some key moments such as the scene with Uncle Ben in the station wagon, and the final graveyard scenes. The actors, especially Kirsten Dunst, sounded like they were reading lines rather than speaking. It wasn't the writing, just the performances, and it really hurt the film most during many of the emotional or philosophically important scenes. This is what really brought the film down to a mediocre C level. Action, special effects, and heroic derring-doo don't make up for weak performances. Allot of this film is for Joe Sixpack, who goes to the movies for laughs and action and snickers at everything else. If it wasn't for the fact that it's attached to the Spider-Man comic book, the film would have been forgotten in just a few short years.
9.0~Good job working in the unintiated timfriday Sign in Permalink For your average comic book turned movie genre, this film was well above average. Although some scenes in the film used to explain certain powers and abilities of Spider-man were slow, they were necessary to include the mass of people that did not have much acquintance w/ the web-slinger. It also managed to stay true to the story of the original much closer than any film of it's kind. It may have been a bit sappy at points but if you actually took the time to read the comics instead of just staring blankly at the drawings you would see that this fits right into the character. Tobey Maquire does a fine job showing the turmoil that is inherit in the character of Peter Parker/Spider-man. And it did a commendable job portraying the relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane. And those that boo the film for a lack of action need to review their comics and see how many pages there are in each one w/ Spidey just swinging around or hanging out w/ miles of monologue interposed or the pages spent on his relationship w/ Mary Jane, Aunt May, and Harry Osbourn. This is one of the few films that ever did the comic book any justice.
10.0~The start of Marvel Comic movies begins with a BANG dizzyd913 Sign in Permalink Movies about comic book characters never really had a comic book feel. Until now. Spiderman looks so much like a comic book come to life. The motions of Spidey as he webslings himself through NYC, may look physically impossible, but that's what it needs. It needs to be that way to be true to the comic. Kirsten Dunst (*drooool*) as Mary Jane was on the button. Yes her lines were very cheesy, and "comic book-esque" but that's the way it should be! This movie blew my mind and i can't wait for the 2nd installment.
9.0~Best Film of 2002 RJBose Sign in Permalink "Spiderman" was easily the best (i.e. most enjoyable) film of the year, with a good story, good character development and state-of-the-art special effects. OK, the Green Goblin outfit was a bit hokey and the movie was a wee bit slow in parts, but the scenes of New York were surprisingly authentic (I liked the attention to detail, such as the small Columbia University pennant in Peter's apartment) and the story was just plain good, old-fashioned excitement, and fun. See it (again)!
3.0~The two stools theory hartley_daniel Sign in Permalink You have two stools in a room. Each stool represents a film at the pinnacle of it's genre. One of these stools if the Action Film stool, lets say Speed or Die Hard. The other is the Drama stool, lets say, Amadeus. Now how far apart are these stools in a room? Pretty far apart right? So any film, no matter how big it's ass, will fall between these two stools if it tries to sit on them both, correct? This movie will sit on the floor with the rest of the garbage. Ladies and gentleman, I give you Sam Raimi's Spiderman.
7.0~Cracking Comic-Book Adventure With Your Friendly Neighbourhood Web-Slinger ShootingShark Sign in Permalink Peter Parker is a high-school kid about to graduate when he is bitten by a genetically-enhanced super-spider. He develops extraordinary powers; great strength, heightened awareness, lightning reflexes and spiderlike abilities to climb and spin webs. At a crossroads in his life, he resolves to become Spiderman, a crime-fighting superhero ... This is a great action blockbuster version of one of the most famous and beloved comic-books of all time - Stan Lee's Spiderman. It had been done before in the seventies as an animated TV show and a pretty good TV-movie, but this is the treatment it really deserves - a big-budget extravaganza with a first-rate cast, terrific sets and special effects and a brilliant visual stylist at the helm. David Koepp's script wisely invests lots of time in the characters - despite the title, this is really a movie about who Peter Parker is, what happens to him, and why he does what he does. Maguire gives an assured but atypical superhero performance, quiet and affable and completely lacking in pretension. Dunst is a great all-American girl, Dafoe is terrific as the schizophrenic villain, alternating between ambitious-but-cowardly scientist Norman Osborn and his depraved alterego, the Green Goblin, and don't miss a funny cameo by Raimi's old pal Campbell as a wrestling emcee. The one duff note is Franco, whose performance is okay but has too much screen-time and whose role seems a bit unnecessary. There are some terrific gags and set-pieces, like the spider-sense sequence in the school and the big parade the Green Goblin attacks, all accompanied by a great Danny Elfman score. This movie was a richly-deserved success both critically and commercially, for one of American's most original and talented directors, but whilst it is very good I'm afraid I have to say that not only is it not Raimi's best movie, it's not even his best comic-book movie (for that, check out Darkman, which is much wilder visually). It's hard to find any fault in such a fabulous fun flick though, which entertains throughout with laughs, scares, romance and thrills.
2.0~I want my 2 hours back no2d10-1 Sign in Permalink Unless you have something against refined acting, intelligent story design, screenplays intended for 12-year-olds, or you simply happen to LOVE Spider-Man, this is a movie you can probably do without. While the movie did have its few moments, the vast majority of the 2 hour flick seemed reminiscent of a glorified action-figure commercial. If you're seeking intelligent entertainment, go see "Cider House Rules" or something where Toby Mcguire isn't blatantly wasting his talent.
9.0~One of my favorite movies BenRyan Sign in Permalink From the first time I heard they were making a Spider-Man movie, I couldn't wait to see it. May 3 couldn't come soon enough. I was worried when first heard that Tobey Maquire was Peter Parker/Spider-Man. I couldn't see him as an comic book hero. When i saw the movie, my opinion changed completely. He was the best cast as Parker. At times though I thought he was a little under what I was expecting for Spider-Man, but I think he did very well. And then there is the fact of the special effects. Great, but in a few spots, it is so obvious when things change from real-life to CGI especially toward the beginning. Towards the end, though, I had stopped noticing and was completely into the movie. Now that I've seen it once, I NEED to go see it again. I also can't wait for the next 2 in the coming years.
10.0~Decades in one film leafboy-2 Sign in Permalink The writers of the film did an excellent job of taking decades of Spider-Man lore and putting it into a one-film package. The comic love interests of Gwen Stacey (who the Green Goblin killed in the comic book) and Mary Jane Watson are combined into one character. Updating the original tale from the '60s to the '00s is done seamlessly. Willem Dafoe takes the same energy he put into his Oscar-deserving role in Shadow of the Vampire and transforms the Green Goblin into the best comic-book-turned-movie villain ever. But the most important feature, and what made Spider-Man stand above all other comic creation, is the portrayal of the superpowers as a curse; that Parker is, in the end, a tragic hero. Parker is real, unlike the playboy Bruce Wayne or the why-is-it-that-no ono-recognizes-me-with-glasses Clark Kent. We relate to his regrets, his unrequited love and his loyalties. And that's far more important than any special effect or action shot.
9.0~A movie that literally web-slings off the screen! macekoe Sign in Permalink Before seeing this film I was apprehensive about it. I mean Tobey Maguire as a superhero? Well, I was definitely surprised. It's amazing how much better a film gets when you bring in good actors for what would normally be a popcorn movie. And this movie is chock full of great actors. Maguire is absolutely amazing as Spiderman, while other notables are Robertson and Simmons, who despite having small roles, steal the few scenes they are in. Dafoe brings a tough character to life in dramatic, sometimes corny, but always entertaining fashion. Overall, this is a must-see pre-summer blockbuster, so get to your local theater NOW!
6.0~This movie wasn't satisfying micheleacooper Sign in Permalink SPOILER: Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) I have recently just watched the movie "Spiderman" and I have to say that I should have trusted my senses. Before watching this movie, spider man was made out to be a comedic super hero in the Marvel Multiverse. I can say that I was disappointed at the fact that it wasn't as comedic as the comics made it out to be. Spiderman, A super human that developed spider like abilities i.e. Climbing, Webs, Etc... But there are some things that the Spiderman movie got wrong. With his Blue and red "Suit" how is he able to climb the walls when the "things" that grew out of his hands are now covered. I understand that this is a long shot but the scene where Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) lets the robber get away, this then leads to the robber killing uncle ben, but however his "Spider Senses" can detect the littlest things that could go wrong but could not feel anything bad happening when he lets the robber get away? Alright, all I have been doing in this review is ripping the film apart but all things aside, the story line/plot was a good idea. Nerd boy gets bitten, finds out he is superhuman, his friend dates the girl he likes, said friend screws things up with said girl, said girl and Spiderman have a connection, said girl also has feelings for Spiderman's alter ego, peter turns girl down to save her, roll credits. Pretty standard, but the way the portrayed it was alright, it wasn't good, but it wasn't bad. The acting though. Tobey Maguire casted to play a comedic hero but fails to do so, I mean he has his moments but over all his performance id give it 6/10. Kirsten Dunst casted as Mary Jane. Mary Jane was actually really plain. It didn't seem like she could play a character with a sophisticated background and part in the movie. Sophisticated? Yes, we see throughout the movie she is miserable and unable to hold a steady relationship. Not to mention the screaming match her and her father get into, not really a healthy home life and her mother? Where is she? So over all Kirsten Dunst, only a 4/10. James franco plays the role of Harry Osborn, the bestfriend of Peter Parker. This character interested me. Finding out that Himself and his best friend both have the love interest, then taking the girl and screwing things up all because of his father, really just a stupid situation to be in. Then he is betrayed by Peter when he sees Peter and Mary Jane share an intimate moment, not only this but not even knowing how his father died, also Peters fault or "Spiderman's". Probably the best acting out of the bunch, with a ratin of 7/10. This movie overall was pretty average for a "Superhero" movie. 6/10 Rating
6.0~A very enjoyable, yet flawed movie patrick_dunne Sign in Permalink Yes, another one. Spider-man stars Tobey McGuire as Peter Parker and is based on the comic book. Now, we have seen many comic book movies, but spider-man may be among more of the "fun" comic book movies. Of course, we all know what happens in the beginning. Peter, a nerd in school who is in love with the popular girl, Mary Jane, transforms into a crime-fighting superhero. Despite the clichéd beginning, the movie gets better. After the introduction of the hero, a villain arises. The Green Goblin becomes the bad guy after a science experiment goes wrong. Yes, another cliché. Okay, so the story isn't perfect. It is full of clichés. But, it does have its high points. Despite the fact that it is a comic book movie, it manages to add a few dramatic moments. Obviously Sam Raimi didn't mind adding some heart. (Spoilers) The final fight between Spider-man and the Green Goblin is also very satisfying, and "cool." (End of Spoilers) But, to counter the positive side, the special effects are pretty bad and corny, and therefore the action isn't as good as we would like it to be. It's pretty hard to hide bad special effects like Jaws did, (even if it was a malfunction) when Spider-man doesn't have any water or anything to cover him. Another corny part was when Peter was trying to get Mary Jane to fall in love with him. He doesn't give a very good speech. Spider-man is a pretty bad flick, but if you turn your brain off, it's quite enjoyable. I mean, it's a whole lot better than all of those darn chick flicks where the un-poplar girls get the guy and triumph of the popular girls. I, and many more people, prefer the sequel. I will get a lot of disagreements on this, but the sequel hasn't totally ridden itself of clichés, but it has upped the special effects, drama and lowered the cheese factor. 6/10 Good: Action, and many good scenes Bad: Corny special effects, speeches and clichéd story
1.0~Dear "filmmakers", what have you done with my childhood hero?!! webspinner Sign in Permalink Awful disapointment, think I'll keep on reading comics instead. This movie was made only for the producers and everyone, who's getting money for it, but not for the average-viewer, and defenitely not for spidey-fans. I was sad, when I came out from the theater. Been waiting for this movie since I was 8, and it's a real crap. It was made by guys who don't know anything about Spider-man or comics generally.
9.0~8.5 7Modus Sign in Permalink Being a long time fan of the comics, I was very interested when hearing they were creating a Spider-Man film. Though to be honest, my expectations of this film were not very high. My only hope was that the movie would at least respect the comics' origins, continuity, and personalities of Peter and the rest of the characters. I was both impressed and pleasently surprised by how well this was done. The plot is exciting and dramatic, and doesn't get boring even if you know the story inside and out. Tobey Maguire does an excellent Peter Parker, nailing the role perfectly; from the sharp intellect to the cheesy jokes. I was equally impressed with almost all the other actors. The special effects were beautifully done, and truly succeeded in adding excitement to an already superbly crafted, suspenseful script. This movie stays true enough to the comics to satisfy even the most devoted fan, while at the same time delivering action, adventure, drama, suspense, and romance, making "Spider-Man" an enjoyable experience for all. My only complaints; the mediocre actor who played J. Jonah Jameson failed to portray the character convincingly. I was dissapointed with their interpretation of the character, and even more dissapointed with the flawed, overexaggerated acting used to convey the character. I also felt that not only was it unneccesary to go against the comics by having Peter's webs naturally produced by him, but that it was detrimental to the character of Peter Parker; as him creating the web-shooters on his own showcased his intelligence and creativity, qualities that the movie could've shown in greater light. I thought the Green Goblin could've been made to look a lot more authentic, I wasn't very impressed with the new, sleek, cheesy metallic-looking Goblin. Also, while the actor who played Norman Osbourne did a great job of acting, once again I think the character could've been captured better. Though all in all, "Spider-Man" makes for a great movie. Far better than most of the garbage being put out nowadays. It's certainly refreshing to see a movie which succeeds in using modern film technology and special effects to tell a superb story. For the most part, excellent acting and screenplay. Though my only dissapointment is this movie could've easily been so much better than it already is, if only a few minor details in the screenplay and choice of actors were altered.
10.0~Lots of fun bob_szwarc Sign in Permalink This film is an example of how a comic book hero can come to life on the big screen. Lots of action, but the film revolves around Peter Parker's love for the girl next door and how he learns to use his newly aquired powers. Lots of fun for everyone!
6.0~Two Thumbs Up. The_Orenda Sign in Permalink Spider-Man finally moved it to the movie screen and it was about time. The computer effects lived up to its end of the bargain and the actors did the best they could to make the movie a further success, but the action was left wanting. Not to mention the costuming of the Green Goblin was a joke and a half. For a movie that demands drama in its characters, where's that fair share in the action when we're sitting for two hours? Nerdy, anti-social teenager Peter Parker gets bitten by a radioactive spider. His world never becomes the same. Spider-Man's "origin" story stays true to its roots and everything is perfect on the comic side. Mess with Stan Lee's, "With Great Power comes Great Responsibility" moral and you're in big trouble. But the ferocity of the fights between Spider-Man and Green Goblin were terribly anti-climactic until the end when, even then, they were beating each other up instead of showing a good dramatic fight. In the end, it was good to see Spidey on the movie screen, even when dull at some moments.
9.0~Spider man 2002 Review patrickjd-47829 Sign in Permalink Good for it's time still good now. Nominated 2 oscars this is not a movie to miss. As nowadays we see endless on endless spider man movies this one stoped being repetitive in the way of releasing to much trailers. And in the movie itself. Each action sene way more different then the last one. But it's not just the action that drew me in it was the characters. As everyone in the movie but some side characters had a back story to why they were doing what thay were doing. Even just the little sense like when the goblin was staring in a mirror at himself but having visions of the person he's talking to telling him what to do. And this being the first movie I've ever seen I'm happy. I'm going to give Spider-Man (2002) an: A
6.0~lack of style... MarcAndrePilon Sign in Permalink I don't know... I seem to be one of the only people here that didn't really enjoy the film. It was okay but... Maybe because I was deceive that this film didn't have the suspense of A simple plan, the emotions of The Gift or the fun mixes with visual style of the Evil Dead series. Maybe because I was deceive of not finding in the screening the richfuls colours of the preview, or maybe was I just deceive because the Green Goblin looks like a Power Ranger... This movie is a great blockbuster but it was done knowing that it would be a sucess. What I mean is that the preproduction (the Green Goblin again, what Mary Jane -where's Gwen Stacy?- wears (expensive clothes there for the girl-next-door) and the postproduction (people go crazy on the effects but look a Peter Parker when he jumps from building to building before he have the suit and all the CG scenes that have the Green Goblins, they look like FX done for the TV...) where done too quickly. Finally, maybe I was expecting too much (even if I didn't think so) but Raimi's Spiderman is inferior, to me, of Burton's Batman (that got that visual style i'm talking about) and even X-Men or, I'll even say, The Mask!
5.0~Great entertainment, but a very scratchy adaptation Ziya90 Sign in Permalink I watched the movie many times, it is one of the most enjoyable movies, but in comparison with the comic book or the animation series (to me one of the bests of all time), it was very disappointing, because no expectation is met here. Raimi (and also Tobey Maguire himself) has made us believe that Tobey Maguire is Peter Parker/Spider-Man, despite the original character is much more stalwart and he is not that loser as Peter Parker in this adaptation. What kind of person Peter Parker is? The movie becomes scratchy while asking this question, in other words, the introduction of one of the best Super heroes is unsatisfying. In addition, may be the most important part of the movie, the part which the spider bites Parker and the metamorphosis process were great fun, but something is missing. Can it be a careful direction and a brilliant script? The bite scene take place too early, it is also an ordinary scene from the movie. Spider-Man flies throughout the city, those images are dazzling, then he rests the Gargoyles statue, sometimes he talks with it which is humor. In the movie all these details and more are ignored. The tone and the atmosphere of the movie are very different, so I felt out of things. By the way, the fight in the school, the zooms before that look amateurish. As I know, some people criticize the film so that it is like a teenager movie, in my opinion, it is not, but it has different problems. In some scenes, very bad CGI is an eyesore. I just did not like the wrestling scenes, it is because of Raimi again, the Wolverine fight in X-Men, for example was much more better, excellent. J. Jonah Jameson character is cartoonish, especially in the second movie, he was superficial, but some people think that he is as good and funny as the original character. The action scene with balloons (recalls Batman) is the best action scene of the movie and great fun, too and there is a weird image that Parker imitates Superman! Lastly, the humor conception, many enemies versus Spider-Man fantasy, character development, story editing, lack of detail etc. are problematic. Spider-Man often puts his camera somewhere in the crime scene in order to take money from J. Jonah Jameson. Sometimes, the camera crumbles, but sometimes he succeeds in delivering the photos. Or Spider-Man is a chatterbox, he often talks with himself while flying or fighting his enemies. Sometimes, he makes jokes about the situation he is in etc. None of them is here! Spider-Man is a feel yourself good movie and one of the most entertaining movies, but fails as a Spider Man movie.
10.0~Action spectacular! grantcook Sign in Permalink I have been itching to see Spider-Man after I only mildly enjoyed "Attack of the clones". that film did not live up to its hype..so I was fairly scepticle when it came to this film... as the hype was even more than that of Star wars. With one exception. This film delivers. Big time. It was everything I enjoyed about the Spider-man comic and cartoon, Tobey maguire is awesome as Peter Parker/Spider-Man totally nailing everything about the character. Kirsten Dunst was great as MJ, she kept getting to me, every time her and peter had a 'moment'. Wilem Dafoe relishes his role as the green goblin...He's over the top without being too hammy. But the real treasure..the man who makes the film, is J.K. Simmons, who plays peter's boss J.Jonah Jameson. I couldnt stop laughing everytime I heard his voice. Sam raimi's direction is spot on. He has truly bought this comic book to life. I never doubted that raimi's touch would lift this above a mere popcorn movie. Like the orignal Batman, he treats the character with respect. I also trusted David Koepp's writing. He's been behind some the biggest Blockbusters ever made (Jurrasic Park) and He know how to avoid making things corny. Overall there is nothing I didnt like about this film...it completely lives up to its hype. ***** 5 out of 5
8.0~The Amazing Spider-man makes An Amazing Film Lord_Crypto Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi has taken perhaps one of the most popular comic book characters and turned him into a movie star. The result, a huge franchise that has launched into a huge success. Spider-man is a terrific movie with good casting, a good story, a good theme song (courtesy of The Amazing Danny Elfman), and amazing special effects. Tobey Maguire fills the role of Peter Parker perfectly. He has the appearance and the attitude of a young Peter Parker. His appearance is enough to convince me he is good for the role. He looks like he was born for the part and he does a fantastic job of filling it. I have been somewhat skeptical about Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. I never pictured her as being the Mary Jane type physically although she does a good job with the part. I have always been skeptical with James Franco as well. I do not think he did a fantastic job as Harry Osborne and I still ponder on him being cast (although he had a much better portrayal in Spider-man 3). His character just seems to outgoing, to selfish, and almost annoying(?). Willem Dafoe, in my opinion, stole the show. He plays Norman Osborne and the villainous Green Goblin. An absolutely perfect choice for the character. He has the anger to play the character and the ability to transform characters (From Osborne to the Goblin) easily and perfectly. His mental psyche is absolutely perfect for the character. I will admit, I did not really like his costume, but that is just his costume! His character is perfect! And there is some comic relief in this film, J.K. Simmons plays an unforgettable and perfect J. Jonah Jameson (editor in chief of the daily bugle). The story is very good though I feel the movie starts out awkward. I do not like how they really rush into Spider-man's transformation and the movie seems somewhat off tempo to start. The entire initial movie sequence up to when Peter's Uncle Ben confronts him in the car seems just rushed. After that, it seems like the movie moves more smoothly. Other than that, there is little I have to dislike about the film. The special effects are amazing and the design work done on Spidey's costume is terrific. The fight sequences are great and the final showdown between Spidey and the Goblin is awesome. The entertainment in this movie is high quality. Spider-man is a hero people feel they can relate to. He has duties that he feels he must commit to as a superhero and he faces real life challenges and personal problems outside of that life. This movie does a great job of capturing that. Whether you think of Spider-man as being "Amazing" or "Spectacular", either of these words can be used to describe the Spider-man film.
10.0~What popcorn movies should be hieroglyph Sign in Permalink This is, in my opinion, the best film of the 00s so far. Not only is it a hugely entertaining rollercoaster of an action film, but it remembers to do what most don't, which is to make us connected with the people involved, their motivations and emotions. The casting was perfect, the direction was excellent and the CGI and effects were breathtaking. 10/10.
8.0~An entertaining and faithful adaptation of the comic gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297 Sign in Permalink It's a shame that I didn't see this movie back at 2002 when I was a little kid, but since it's almost celebrating it's 10th anniversary with The Amazing Spider Man coming out this year, I'm going to review all three Spiderman films starting with this one. The reason why I'm giving this an 8/10 is because it's a more faithful adaptation of the comic book it was based on and tells the origins of how Spiderman came to be perfectly. Sam Raimi's direction is surprisingly superb and the cinematography is flawless, but I think that the atmospheric music score from Danny Elfman, the groundbreaking action, the visuals (great CGI included) and an excellent cast (Tobey Mcguire did a great job portraying as the brainy and awkward nerd before transforming into Spiderman after getting bitten by a spider. Not to mention kicking some a** in the process. Kirsten Dunst was very cute as the love interest Mary Jane and the interactions between Mary and Peter are brilliant. J.K Simmons did a good job as J. Jonah Jameson, the grouchy news publisher who fired everybody which caused me to laugh my butt off. Arguably, I think Willem Defoe steals the show for not only his scary, but his over-the-top performance as Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin. Other actors including James Franco and Rosemary Harris are also pretty good as well) are the only strongest aspects of the entire movie. The only two complaints that I do have with this movie is the clunky editing and it's corny Dialogue ("The Itsy Bitsy Spider Went Up The Water Spout", "And when she got out of the car, and you saw her for the first time, you grabbed me and you said, "Aunt May, Aunt May, is that an angel?", "You have a knack for saving my life. I think I have a superhero stalker.") Overall, not a masterpiece, but an entertaining and faithful comic book movie nonetheless and would always be recommended to die-hard fans of superhero movies.
9.0~MaGuire is the perfect guy for Spiderman danthemovieman Sign in Permalink I thought that this movie was going to be average, but it turned out I thought it was above average. Maguire is very good as Peter Parker, a schoolboy whose had a crush on the girl next door ever since he saw her. On a school field trip, when the class is investigating spiders, Parker is bitten by a very odd one, and the very next day finds out that he has super powers. When his best friend's dad finds out he has super powers of his own, Spiderman and "The Green Goblin" are immediately enemies. This was a box office bulls-eye and I can see why now, it's still in theaters and my advise to anyone who is reading this right now is "After reading this, get in your car, and drive to the theater". ***1/2 out of ****
9.0~Great movie that combines superhero epic with substance wilm-1 Sign in Permalink This movie, unlike most action-adventure junk, had a warm human presence because it involves growing up, an unrequited love, a family, and several friendships. It also had a substantive ending that teaches an important lesson. My only complaint: the last half hour of the movie was predictable. Still, a great show.
8.0~an amazing movie erevno Sign in Permalink great movie. Great job by the writers to bring life to the characters, and even set-up the sequel pretty nicely. First off, this is a character driven comic book action movie. maybe the first of it's kind. Dafoe rules as the Green Goblin. Probably his most memorable roll since Platoon. Tobey lights it up as the photography geek turned hero and Kirsten Dunst is babelicious. on par with the first Batman movie!
5.0~5TH HIGHEST GROSSING FILM! - WORLD GONE MAD!! Basildon Mike Sign in Permalink I cannot believe this film is so popular. After reading numerous comments ranging from 'Amazing' to 'Best film ever', did I see a different version from everyone else? This was slow, badly acted by Dafoe and Franco, had very little action, and was filled with plot holes. Some of the effects were good, but others were pretty shoddy. Where was the excitement and tension? This had no 'wow' factor whatsoever. This is guilty of everything Clones has been accused of - slow, too much love stuff, rough CGI (unfounded as far Im concerned)- but at least that had an awesome final 45 minutes. What happens here - a five minute fight where a few walls get knocked over in an old building!! The Green Goblin was a complete failure, from the stupid costume to a complete lack of motivation for doing anything (He was trying to stop a corporate takeover, right? - The world shudders in fear!!). And why if he wanted to find out who Spiderman was, didnt he just take off his mask when he drugged him?????? The few good things - Kirsten's wet T-shirt (nice!), Tobey was OK, and J.K. Simmons really brings to life J.Jonah Jameson. Clones, although not perfect, was infinitely more enjoyable than this and I could easily watch that for a third time and I cant wait for the DVD. This, I might watch again when it turns up on TV in few years time. Jim Cameron why did you have pass this over? I know you would have made a truly amazing movie and not the dull one Raimi has given us!
9.0~unique among big summer blockbusters mouse_robot Sign in Permalink I knew nothing about Spiderman before this movie, except that he spun a web at any size. When I first saw the movie, I was a little taken aback: I didn't know that it was a goofy character piece. I was expecting just another fun silly summer movie. I'm pleased that I got far more than I expected. The action scenes and the fights with the Green Goblin were, for me, the least interesting parts of the movie. The most interesting parts were when the characters were just talking to each other, and the emotional drama that came from these scenes. During the final conflict, I found myself wanting more such scenes as opposed to more action sequences. Don't get me wrong; the action scenes in Spiderman are fantastic. They're just not as interesting as the drama of the characters' inner lives. Much of the time in these movies, such scenes are often just bridges in between action scenes. I was quite pleased to get so much more with Spiderman.
10.0~My opinion leftysmom Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi did an execellent job directing this film. He has the perfect cast for the film and it was entertaining the whole way through. I am glad that Raimi struggled to get Maguire even though the studios did not want Maguire to do it. It was a brillant choice seeing as Maguire does a brillant job. Kirsten Dunst was also wonderful. I enjoyed this movie a lot. My advice if you haven't seen it make sure you dont miss it! great movie
6.0~Spider Sense is Tingling C22Man Sign in Permalink A live action Spider-Man had been in the works for some time before comic-book fan and cult favourite Sam Raimi's film hit the big screen. The most notable was James Cameron's scriptment, whilst the likes of David Fincher and Tony Scott were considered for the job. Raimi got the gig, directing a film that works as both an origin story and as a fun action flick. It's clear that he has a love for the source material and that he understands the larger than life aspects of the comic world. What we get is good fun with some big limitations. The films heart is in the right place and it's full of emotion, yet the writing is frequently sloppy and it does descend into campiness a little too much. Story: Nerdy teenager Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider and develops spider-like abilities. He decides to use these powers to fight crime as Spider-Man once his uncle is killed. He is forced to confront businessman Norman Osborn whose evil alter ego is taking revenge on those who turned on him. The origin story is fairly simplistic, but I enjoy the messages it gets across. The 'great responsibility' stuff might be corny but it really works because the connection between Peter and his family feels genuine, whilst Peter developing and testing his new power is handled with care. Even though Peter's relationship with Mary Jane leads to some convolution I think it is handled well here. The Goblin plot is only where things go astray and that is mostly down to unclear writing. Hero: Tobey Maguire puts in a strong performance as Peter. What impresses is that he manages to capture the characters awkwardness whilst retaining an honest likability. His actions and motivations seem very natural. His Spider-Man isn't as witty or wisecracking as many want him to be, but I don't think that's much of an issue here. Villain: Willem Dafoe as Osborn proves to be extremely hit-and-miss. When Dafoe concentrates on the characters unease and the conflict within he is excellent, carrying a real sense of menace. The Goblin is just a hammy mess for the most part. Partly because the characters feelings and motivations are completely unfocused, partly because of some absolutely horrid dialogue and delivery. Support: Kirsten Dunst is good as M.J. She does have the girl next door vibe, while her motivations are clear and her relationship with Peter is built up with authenticity. I just don't like the way she is always a damsel and effectively becomes a plot device for Spider- Man to save. James Franco does a solid job as Peter's best friend and Norman's son Harry. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson bring a welcomed sincerity to May and Ben. A real standout is J. K. Simmons as Jameson in what is some of the best casting ever seen. He nails the role by being a wonderful mixture of deadpan, sardonic and arrogant. Action: The action is certainly a mixed bag. While sequences like the wrestling match and the montage of Spider-Man's activity are great fun, the main pieces are a bit of a let-down. The parade fight is harmed by some woeful CGI which makes the city look like cardboard. The climax is a cool set-up, but lacks any real heft and it ends up being a bland punching match. That said, the scene in the flaming building is brilliant and features some really impressive effects. Music: Danny Elfman provides a surprisingly effective score. It's much bouncier and more bombastic than his usual work, fitting the film extremely well and giving a real sense of excitement to the images of Spider-Man swinging through the city. His main theme is also very memorable. Production: I find Sam Raimi's direction to be a lot of fun. He always appears to know what a scene needs to give it an extra spark and the camera follows suit in that respect. In a number of areas the CGI holds up well, but in many areas they are badly dated with some of the action scenes are affected by this. Even though Spider- Man swinging through New York looks great, there is a lack of weight to his movements that makes it obvious that CG was used. As far as the writing is concerned, all feel that the more humane aspects are expertly handled, but the superhero material suffers. There is a lot of emotion to be found in Peter's guilt and his connection with Mary Jane, yet his heroic antics do come across as clichéd and don't fit what the film appears to going for at all. The Green Goblin falls foul to a number of especially bad moments, the finish it scene and the ''Sleep..'' line are just cringe-worthy in the worst possible way. Conclusion: So while it is probable that Spider-Man was the first big modern superhero film and did start a tremendously successful trilogy, I simply think that it is a decent film, nothing more or less. It does offer a lot of entertainment and a heart which many superhero films lack, but it's susceptible to falling down when it looks like it will soar. In Sam Raimi you have an appealing director and yet I don't think he is fully able to do what he wished. What we get is a script that becomes too cluttered and a villain that is way too campy when the majority of the film isn't. With Maguire we have an easy to like lead adding to a very solid supporting cast and I do enjoy the relationships the characters have. In a way I wish there was more of that emotion. Instead we get a film that just about manages to balance heart over silliness.
10.0~Very Good tiyusufaly Sign in Permalink This film was very well done after all the hype about it. It had neat special effects and a cool storyline. Many people compare it with Star Wars: Episode II. When asked which one is better, I cannot decide. They are both beautifully done and have great plots. I will be anticipating the sequel to Spider-Man. 10/10
9.0~Possibly the Best First-Time Superhero Film Since Reeve's Superman of the 70's classicalsteve Sign in Permalink The first time an iconic superhero flies across the big screen in his (or her) tights, cape and/or mask, the end product often has mixed results. The bar was set pretty high with the first "Superman" film starring Christopher Reeve, Marlon Brando, and Gene Hackman, still probably the finest superhero film ever produced. The first "Batman" film, directed by Tim Burton and starring Michael Keaton in the title role and Jack Nicholson as the Joker had problems, some wonderful moments in between lagging scenes. (Some people have called "Batman" the best mediocre film ever produced! Or is it the most mediocre film among good ones?) Either way, the end result may or may not hit the mark. Luckily, especially for fans of the original comic book, the first Spider-man film, based on the character created by Stan Lee, works on a level towards the original Superman film. When you boil down the raw elements needed to create a good film, you need three things: a good premise, good actors, and a good screenplay. And let's not under-appreciate the last one. While a good screenplay still may save mediocre acting, often the opposite isn't true. In Spider-man, all three are present in spades. Let's look at them in terms of how they are portrayed in the current film. The Premise. Well, the premise must be a good one because, since its inception in the 1960's, Spider-man has become one of the most important comic heroes alongside Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman. However, Lee brought a bit of a twist to the character. Like other superhero characters who have some magic-like abilities, in this case the abilities of a spider inside a human body, Spider-man's alter-ego, Peter Parker is a troubled adolescent suffering from the typical angst of all young people around that age. Unlike Superman, Parker is still finding out where he fits in. In terms of the present film, the original premise, although updated slightly for the 21st century, is still adhered to. Parker/Spider-man is an angst-ridden kid, loving a faraway female, trying to navigate school, and dealing with bullies. The Acting. The acting takes us right into the heads of the three most important characters: Spider-man/Peter Parker (Toby Maguire), the Green Goblin/Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe), and Mary Jane Watson, a.k.a. MJ, (Kirsten Dunst). Maguire offers both the angst-riddled teen and the resolved superhero. I particularly appreciated the way he was portrayed in the film. Not a bad-looking kid but not a GQ cover model either. He's rather nerdy, a science wiz, like Lee had envisioned him, but not the best at getting dates. The absolute stand-out is Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin/Mr Osborne. Character actors like Dafoe, similar to Gene Hackman as Lex Luther, are the best suited to play villains. Dafoe is terrific as a kind of Marvel equivalent of Two-Face, having two sides to him. On one had he's the upper-crust businessman who's tough but confident. However, the other side, the Green Goblin side, emerges and confronts the "waking" self. He becomes a kind of split personality that few actors can pull off, and the scenes in which the two sides speak to one another are entirely believable. Also honorable mention to Dunst who is a very attractive high school girl but certainly not someone who will be entering teen beauty pageants. She attracts the likes of Peter Parker at a very human level. The screenplay, probably the most important ingredient, works well, and much better than the Keaton/Burton "Batman". Parker is a typical high school kid just trying to navigate through school, being cared for by his adoptive uncle and aunt since the death of his parents. Then a strange circumstance changes his life: he's bitten by a radioactive spider which gives him spider-like abilities. A nice series of sequences shows him testing his new-found talents. At first Parker uses them to earn money in trashy athletic events, but then he switches gears and decides to use them to combat evil. Certainly we know this will be Spider-man's calling but a conversation with his uncle puts him on track, reminiscent of Brando as Superman's father. On another front, the father of a friend of Parker's, Norman Osborne, is head of a tech company testing a machine which would improve human metabolism in soldiers, probably for the military, a bit like Captain America. Osborne built the company, but now the board of directors are selling the company out from under him. He retaliates by testing the metabolic-altering machine on himself and hence a different side emerges after the experiment. Simultaneously, there's Mary Jane, the distant love of Parker, who knows he exists but is dating a much more athletic and popular guy at school. Eventually, these three stories clash in a wonderful and believable climax. Parker becoming a crime-fighting disguised hero, Osborne becoming an adversary of Spider-man, and Dunst caught in the middle. The story is about transformations. All three characters undergo transformation during the course of the story. Not all seem to relish this transformation and none of them understand fully what it means. Some of them embrace the transformation more than others, but in the end it's unclear whether or not the characters are better for what has happened to them. Two survive the transformation while another doesn't. And that's the mark of a great story: when what seems the inevitable outcome isn't quite what the characters and the audience foresaw. Ultimately, it comes down to caring about the characters and what transpires which evolves them into something else, be they heroic or villainous. Maybe that's the problem with many superhero films, the filmmakers forget that we need to be reminded to care about them, not just be awe-struck when they fly around.
8.0~Pretty Much gets Spiderman right? Yes. Some bad dialogue? Yes. wadew1 Sign in Permalink *spoiler?* What i liked: overall i liked this movie. I thought the CGI was pretty good, i especially liked the webslinging(best sequence being the end)and the acrobatics. Dafoe's Goblin laugh was great. The actor who played Jameson was dead on. What i didn't really like: IMO the thing about this movie is that they really dropped the ball with the dialogue. A lot of stuff was just badly written or badly delivered. The writing in the comics right now is ten times better. ....and they got to work on this script for how many years? ....and it went through what? 2,722 drafts? they especially blew it with Spider-man's dialogue. He's a wisecracker. He's supposed to be funny. He gives you nothing in this movie. Pete as Spidey doesn't have much to say, and when he does...Tobey's just off or it's just not a good line. Ex. Goblin- "Are you in or out?" Spider-man- "It is you who is out, GOBBY!" ....and i still think the Goblin outfit is horrible. The glider was great, but the costume....guh. One more thing that bothered me was how "the burglar" died . They should've stuck with the comics on this one. Wouldn't it have been so much better if Pete had beaten him within an inch of his life and forced himself not to kill the guy who murdered his uncle ? Instead he tripped....and fell out of a window. i guess i'd give it a 7.5/10. It felt like spider-man, but it could've been so much better
7.0~Dis.App.Ointing!! thepts Sign in Permalink Yes, this movie is disappointing. I've heard so much hype from people I know and trust, that I actually had some expectations for sensation & innovation here.. I like the nerdy main character, but Spidey wasn't a nerd when he was Spidey. He was a really cool character with all the right, relaxed punchlines in the middle of danger (while his thoughts betrayed that he was anything besides relaxed). Also, when things got a little too "super-heroey" and the bad guys sported fancy moves and evil, over-the-top cheesy costumes, Spidey always had a sarcastic comment about their suit or similarly, to make them even more angry.. Nothing of that here. The only thing we hear Spidey say, is with a squeaky, nerdy voice - exactly like Peter Parker's. Sigh. Of course, we get the obligatory upside-down-with-mask-half-off - kiss, which is nice enough. The school bully get's a serious beating, which is a great scene. There is also some nice comic relief, for instance when Spidey wears his first suit.. that was really funny, but so were the "worst" love scenes. The evil character is REALLY weakly designed. With the brushed metallic suit, carrying an eeevil grin (help!), it was laughable, and even more kitschily "I wanna be hitech" than Batman's suit in the latter film. Also, the special effects are terrible. When Spidey did his first, spider-like jumps here, you could VERY easily see what was CG and what wasn't. That was especially annoying when there, in a "jumping from roof-to-roof"-scene, for a while was 2 sec CG, 2 sec film, 2 sec CG, etc.. terrible. Attack of the Clones not only - surprisingly (!) - has MUCH less embarrassing, gut-wrenching, mushy love scences, but also is a much more sensational and innovative movie, all over. I thought there might be a "duel" between these two, but no chance whatsoever for Spidey here. All in all, an OK "superhero movie" (which is definitively what it is), but except for the nerdiness and personal problems, it has few of the qualities that made the comic a success. I'm sorry to say that this first Spiderman movie will be forgotten faster than you can say "Two Towers".. 7/10
9.0~Another Great Marvel Comic Movie. GuyCC Sign in Permalink I meant to review this months ago when I had (by great luck) managed to attend the premiere in Los Angeles. Regardless, with a "better late than never" attitude, this has turned out to be one of Summer 2002's bright spots in an incredibly busy movie season. As it stands, "Spider-Man" has all the right elements: A real comic book "feel" to it, an excellent Danny Elfman score, Tobey Maguire as a totally believable Peter Parker (with just the right amounts of shyness and the "old Parker luck"), an appropriately sinister Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, and a scene-stealing performance by J. K. Simmons as the cigar-chomping J. Jonah Jameson. That's a character that should have been used more in the movie, as he was a lot of fun to see in action. Here's hoping for more screen time in the next one. There wasn't a lot that I didn't like about this movie. I still didn't like the Green Goblin costume as much as I tried to, the organic web-shooters didn't bother me half as much as I had figured (perhaps as they weren't overplayed as being so), and while Kirsten Dunst didn't do a bad job as Mary Jane, she just never really captured the "look" of what I though the character should be. As for the "goods" of the film, the battles were perfectly set up as comic-cook style brawls, with plenty of exaggerated movements and situations. When Spider-Man web-swung through the streets of New York (love the costume), I couldn't help but get a chilled sense of awe that I originally felt after seeing the first trailer last year. And the character relationships were great. "Spider-Man" the comic has always been as much about the man behind the mask as it is about the hero. I'm so relieved that Sam Raimi took noticeable attempts to balance the two. Despite its comic-book origins, the last battle is pretty intense, comparably so to the Tim Burton "Batman" films. And the Green Goblin's scare tactics even made myself jump a few times. So parents with very little ones may want to check out the film first to see if the kids can handle it. But in that regard, I'm glad Raimi took the film seriously enough to not let it delve into the lame campiness that was "Batman & Robin". And I'm really glad that they didn't take too many liberties with the Spider-Man origin to remove the emotional impact that it carried throughout the film. As a movie, it retained all of the wonder, excitement and fun that has endeared me to Spider-Man since I was a kid. As a super-hero film, I can compare it to the orignal "Batman" and "Superman" films in its high-quality treatment. I will wait impatiently for the feature-packed (I hope) DVD, and will have faith that the next installment of the series will be as rewarding as this one was. A must see. A fun movie.
9.0~The most Down-to-Earth Superhero movie - Experience the story of your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man! KeyC0de Sign in Permalink Spiderman is a movie based on the homonymous comic book created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. It follows the story of Peter Parker (played by Tobey Maquire) a science nerd, high school boy, who's been love with Mary Jane (M.J.) since 6th grade. Peter's parents have died in a plane crash accident and Peter has been living with his uncle Ben and aunt May since he was very young. One day he goes on a school tour to this government/university laboratory and gets bitten by a genetically engineered spider. Spider instills fluids into his organism that later give Peter supernatural abilities, Spider-sense (sensing danger before it occurs), superhuman strength & reflexes, web generation like a spider etc. Peter's life changes drastically from then onward. He becomes powerful but he's reminded by his uncle (who's his father figure). After a fatal accident that occured on his uncle Ben he's fueled by anger and revenge to stop the ones responsible and fight to stop crime. His friend's father Norman Ozborn, an influential, rich genius with a huge corporation "Ozcorp", becomes evil as Government defense agency pulls funding from him. Norman's double personality (with Green Goblin) won't stop at anything to get what he wants but he must first kill Spiderman, then nothing will stand on its way. Spiderman has long been one of my favorite comic book stories, because it is so down to earth. The audience can really relate to Peter, because what happened to him could really happen to anyone. Sam Raimi's excellent direction does justice to Spiderman's story in the best way possible. It presents it on screen in a surprisingly mature way, realistically, with only a few spicy details thrown every now and then to remind the audience of the comic book fashion of the story. The plot is driven by the excellent pacing in a timely manner. Energetic, fluid, everything flows naturally. Also the fights are well choreographed but nothing too amazing. The movie is very entertaining and enjoyable to watch and re-watch. The cast of characters is truly impeccable. One cannot simply forget the role of J. Jonah Jameson (played by J. K. Simmons) as the chief news editor of "The Daily Bugle" a news company, who employs Peter to take Spiderman's pictures. His cast could only be compared to Gandalf's in LOTR. The acting is great, except one or two scenes that in my opinion are a bit exaggerated. The dialogue is fantastic. As an example, the ending talk by M.J. talking to Peter is played perfectly (i was amazed by the level of emotion in this scene. I was convinced Kirsten Dunst was pefect in her role). The film contains some of the wittiest quotes you'll ever hear. Lets not forget the dialogue scene between Peter and his uncle Ben, "with great power comes great responsibility" speech, which for me is one of the greatest dialogue scenes ever depicted on film. The antagonist "The Green Goblin" is utterly ruthless and a worthy menace to our hero. Cinematography encompasses some spectacular visuals in here, especially when Spiderman webs around the city's SkyScrapers, it is something you've never seen before. It's a delight to watch this movie. CGI aren't great though, they could benefit from a digital remaster. And let's not forget the fantastic work by Danny Elfman on the Soundtrack. It is a pure joy to hear, it enhances the dramatic moments of the film and fits so well throughout. Spiderman is an amazing movie. I loved this film when i watched it when i was young. I rewatched it again yesterday and saw that it hasn't aged a bit. This is a refreshing story, released at an important time for comic book movies that were rising at the time with Blade and X-Men. There are only a few dramatically exagerated scenes, that although serve the story, could have been streamlined a bit for realism, but i understand the director's intentions. Rating: 9/10 - Amazing

6.0~Overated comic book movie! mcrabtre2001 Sign in Permalink People were saying that the Spiderman movie was great but it was not as great as people said it was. What I was disappointed at the movie was the changes they did to the characters. I say the characters were changed WAY TOO MUCH. 1) Spiderman had hair growing out of his fingers like if he was a warewolf. What's that suppose to mean. You never got that in not even 1 comic book issue. In realife if a person had hair growing out of his fingers people would hate him every time he walked around. 2) The Mary-Jane character sucked totally. She looked like she was 55 years old than 20 years old. She looked more like a grandmother for crying out loud. In the comics or the show she looked like the proper age and had better charisma. If I was in charge of the cast I would replace Kirsten with Paula Gerces( the actress from the movie Clockstoppers). Paula Gerces would play a hell of lot better Mary-Jane character. 3) I say the Green Goblin was changed too much. His mask in the movie didn't move when he spoke and they waste money on a heavy armour suit which made him look more like a robot and he moved his arms in slow motion like if he was the Freakin TERMINATOR. The exploding grenades looked more like oranges which made it more suited for a child. In the comics they were exploding jack-0-lanterns. The green Goblin in the comics and the TV show had greenn and purple and his soft mask moved when he spoke. In the movie like The GREEN GOBLIN looked like a stiff character that had been plaigerized from the GREEN HORNET. 4) It had too much love in that movie and it is supposed to have ACTION in that movie. I liked the X-men movie better because at least the characters where only changed just a little. The only changes the X-men characters had was there clothing which is what you get in comic books too. Nothing less it wasn't too bad a film. I recommend watching TOMB RAIDER or JACKIE CHAN MOVIE instead because at least they aren't taken seriously and there better. 6/10
10.0~Great Movie! Three Thumbs Up! oops2crazy4u Sign in Permalink "You think you know?" Nobody can be ready for this special effects thrill ride. "Spider-Man" while mostly computerized, is a must see movie that ranks high with other movies such as "Batman" and "X-Men". It tells the story everyone has heard before about a teenager named Peter Parker who gets bitten by a radioactive spider and obtains spider-like powers. But the audience also gets a glimpse into why Spider-Man decides to fight evil. In other words, Peter Parker doesn't just wake up one day and say, "I wanna put on a spandex suit and fight bad guys". The movie provides a perfect background for the people who didn't read Spider-Man comic books. As far as acting goes the casting director should give himself a pat on the back. Tobey Maguire, while 27, pulls off a high school senior very well. He is the perfect selection for the shy, kinda nerdy, Peter Parker. He is able to have perfect manners and still be as cool as a superhero. Willem Defoe also gives an awesome performance as the green goblin. He has a smirk that can give someone nightmares. He is truly convincing as the bad guy. At the beginning of the movie Peter Parker is narrating and he says,"This like every story is about a girl". I actually saw people walk out of the theatre when he said that!! Too bad for them. They missed a great show
9.0~Don't tell Harry, but Spider-Man was AMAZING! hazzers Sign in Permalink Believe it or not, I was actually looking forward to Spider-Man. A lot. I'll admit, I'm certainly not a comic book person, but the cartoon was brilliant. Since all this hype about Spider-Man began, I had to go out and buy a huge hardback book documenting just about every major storyline that was ever featured in the comic books. Before I went to the film, I knew it'd be good. How could it not be? Surely just having Spider-Man in it would be enough. There's something about him that makes him the coolest super hero (by far). Maybe it's because he's young, different, interesting. Look at Super Man. Boring job, boring life. And how he has the cheek to think a pair of glasses is somehow a 'brilliant' disguise, I'll never know. At least Spider-Man has the decency to cover up a bit. Going in already expecting it to be fantastic could be a problem. I was a little concerned that I'd think it was good when it really wasn't. Although I don't think that was a problem, in the end. A lot of hype, yes - but not over-rated (unlike 'Bored' of the Rings). So, for anyone who's been living in a cave all their life, here's a brief outline of the story. Peter Parker is in his senior year of high school, and is a bit of a science whiz. He has a deep crush on his next-door neighbour, Mary-Jane Watson, and his best friend is Harry Osborn, whose father owns Oscorp Industries. He lives with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May, who are a couple in their late sixties (although it's not mentioned in the film, Peter Parker's parents were apparently killed when he was very young). Peter is often ridiculed at school and people regard him as a bit of a nerd. One day, on a science trip, Peter is bitten by a genetically modified spider. The next day he finds the spider has given him 'Spider Powers' including the ability to scale walls, shoot webs and detect danger with his 'spider sense'. While this is going on, Norman Osborn, owner of Oscorp Industries, is conducting a test on himself to show his chemicals work successfully. However, exposing himself to these chemicals turns him into the evil Green Goblin... The storyline itself is very different and new. Although the storyline has existed for years, what Raimi, Lee et al did with it created a pretty decent film. The camera work was fantastic, which ranged from over-head action shots to intense emotional close-ups. The special effects were flawless. Particularly when the Green Goblin gatecrashed the Oscorp Unity Fair, the scenes of Spider-Man and the Green Goblin battling were incredibly realistic. You could tell a lot of the conventions had been drawn from recent films, such as The Matrix. However, this film itself has set a lot of conventions. Sam Raimi was an excellent choice for the director of this film. He managed to take small, insignificant actions, and turn them into the most memorable scenes in the film. The blood drip from Spider-Man's fight wound is just so inventive and the camera work and special effects make that scene so suspenseful and intense. 'Spider-Man' creates a wide range of emotions - sometimes you'll be staring open-mouthed and engrossed at the action, and other times your heart will be breaking at the grief. Before I went to see this film, I was warned about Tobey Maguire's role of Spider-Man. After seeing it, I can't understand what everyone was complaining about - I honestly can't think of anyone better to play Spider-Man. They needed someone fairly unknown to play Spider-Man, so that they could develop his character from a clean slate. He had the perfect 'nerdy' look at the start (I was a little worried it'd be a typical case of the actor who only needs to remove his glasses in order to be considered attractive...), and definitely stood out next to all the other male characters in the film. Very suited to the role. He even managed to pull off those classic Spider-Man wisecracks. Look out for the "Nice costume - did your husband buy it for you?" when he's wrestling with Bonesaw McGraw. Unfortunately, these wisecracks become a lot more sparse as the film becomes more serious. As for Kirsten Dunst, I think she did well, but I was a little unhappy about Mary-Jane's character (see below). Her performance did seem genuine and believable, and luckily, the red hair dye didn't look too fake... Star role was Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin. He suited the role perfectly, and was easily flitted between the good guy and the bad guy. I also liked J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, but it would've been nice to see a little more of him in this role. For any die-hard comic book fans, the question might be how true did the film stay to the old comic books? Okay, so I'm not a die hard fan, and probably have no place to comment, although I did read the hard back book from cover to cover, and have familiarised myself with the storylines a little. Obviously it would be impossible to stick to the exact storylines that evolved in the comic books. This didn't create too much of a problem, except that there wasn't much room for Spider-Man to develop. In the comic books, there were a few editions of him discovering his powers, fighting a few petty criminals, etc, before he moved onto fighting the big ones. There's no way the film could digress for half of it, before finally introducing the Green Goblin. It was a little cheesy and unconvincing that both Peter Parker and Norman Osborn happened to transform at the same time, as well. However, I think it was generally handled well. Everyone should know that Spider-Man does not actually have the ability to shoot webs, but in the film he does. I can't really say why this is, but I get the feeling that his character is slightly different to the Spider-Man in the comic books. Once Peter Parker left high school, he never seemed to mention science much anymore. I think perhaps they were trying to give him a 'cooler' image, and breakaway from this 'nerd' persona. If Peter Parker had had the knowledge to actually create this webbing fluid, it might have given him a less of a 'cool' and 'macho' image. I also have to say that I wasn't too impressed with Mary-Jane in this film. In the cartoon and comic book, she was far more forward and confident. In the film she seemed a little more insecure and subdued, despite being popular. Kirsten Dunst did say "Tiger" on one or two occasions, but it didn't really look right coming from her character. I was more expecting her to say lines like "Let's face it Tiger, you just hit the jackpot!", giving her a cheeky, almost arguably arrogant character. She was quite different in the film. There were a few other points too, like the way in which Spider-Man and the Green Goblin were created - these processes seemed to be changed slightly to make it more modern, and realistic. Well all know too that Uncle Ben was killed by a burglar - the film modernises this to a car-jacking. And, if I'm right, wasn't it Mary-Jane's Aunt Anna, who lived next door to Peter's Aunt May? Yet, in the film, it was Mary-Jane herself who lived next door to Peter. And it was Aunt May and Aunt Anna who set them up on a blind date, rather than Peter secretly carrying a torch for Mary-Jane. Nevertheless, I feel that creating a film which matched the comic books exactly was quite a tall order. Some parts of the film suffered, because it was hard to cover all the important aspects of Peter's life in two hours. However, I cannot imagine this task being approached any better way. It might've been better if it was a little longer, as, at times, it felt a little rushed. I must say though - a truly fantastic film, full of surprises and excitement. Don't wait for it to come out on DVD - it was an amazing experience watching it on the big screen, and you'll be thoroughly thrilled from start to finish. The ending was absolutely amazing. I won't give anything away, but it was left very much wide open, and was very unexpected - in more ways than you might think! It's fairly obvious they'd always planned to make a 'Spider-Man 2' as well, so I can only hope the sequel is just as good. One thing's for sure: it was waaaaaaay better than Batman...
7.0~Entertaining flick that hits and misses guardkid Sign in Permalink Overall, this was an above-average effort at transforming Spider-Man the comic superhero into his movie counterpart. Given all the hype of the film though, I was a touch disappointed with this first part of a probable 3 episode series. It was entertaining stuff but at times the film seemed to fall between a romance/drama flick (emphasised by the nature of the ending) and a superhero action flick. Throughout Peter Parker was portrayed way too nerdy and besotted with the girl. Another actor -less geeky would have been a better choice than Tobey Maguire. There were too many sentimental scenes for this genre of movie- Spiderman's famous sense of humour was completely discarded-hopefully this side of his character will be developed in the sequel. I'd prefer this any day to the "blubbing" Parker that was seen here. The character played by Kirsten Dunst was iffy- portrayed as a materialistic, boyfriend-changing, Broadway wannabe who by the end is deeply "in love" with the nerdy Parker. This didn't really work and seemed contrived. The pacing was erratic at times - a measured build-up to develop the characters and introduce Spiderman...good, but then within seconds of film-time he's "well known" by everybody in New York City (this worked well in Ghostbusters '84 -but not here!) Also the Green Goblin character was a bit of a mystery-and what was with the ridiculous mask?! The best moments were when Spidey was in action- kicking ass,swinging through the avenues of Manhattan, posturing athletically- basically being a superhero. The special effects were good and Spiderman's acrobatics-enthralling, along with a mix of some really humourous moments and some great action scenes. The best characters in the movie were the ones who "had character" -Parker's uncle, Willem Dafoe's Dr Osborne and the newspaper editor Jamison. Look forward to Spiderman II. Overall rating 7/10.
6.0~A bit disappointing. PatrynXX Sign in Permalink (spoilers) I must admit, I bought the dvd the day it came out. For $15 it was a shoo in. Now that I've watched it... I find myself wondering why did I? Certainly it's an okay movie. And appreciate the excitement over this movie. But I fail to see where everyone can just give it a 10/10. It certainly can't get any awards for being a quality film. The plot is a bit fuzzy. The editing work is rather poor. The acting is pretty good, but the costume for Williams Dafoe is idiotic. Alot of the CGI work is extremely fake. They didn't do much in way of production values for the dvd. It's design in both technical and layout was created by a drunk. With absolutely no hint on how to design a good menu system. It does have a good share of easter eggs. The CGI bloopers provide about a minute of laughs. But the other 2 minutes are filler crap. Shrek's CGI bloopers are better. The majority of my 6/10 rating comes from the last 20 minutes of the movie. A majority of plot items are left explained. Who made his nice gettup? You don't go from a moronic costume to this awesome suit without some sort of inspiration. And the idiots at Columbia/tri star failed to respect Stan Lee (the creator of Spider Man). Last I heard, he was suing. But that was a couple of months ago. I do hope that was an oversight. Alas, this is just a little better than another blockbuster flop. Independence Day. 6/10 Quality: 4/10 Entertainment: 8/10 Replayable: 7/10 (indeed I ain't selling it that's for sure)
10.0~A perfect, classic, epic superhero film. Prashast_Singh Sign in Permalink SPIDER-MAN is a stupendous masterpiece of the superhero cinema. It blends action, adventure, humour, emotions, thrills and science fiction in a perfect way. Tobey Maguire's whole-hearted portrayal of SPIDER-MAN is flawless. I remember watching this movie as a very young child and loved every bit of it. Just few weeks ago, I re-watched the film in high quality to recall the old good memories of the film as well to enjoy it in the best picture quality. I felt more enthralled and intrigued than earlier. Each and every actor in this film has given an explosive performance. Tobey is undoubtedly very relatable as Peter Parker, with whom you won't mind sharing his tears. The way the film's mood turns to a very intense one towards the end, his act intensifies. You see him breathe the roles of Peter and Spidey. Willem Dafoe plays an easily menacing antagonist whose actions make him very entertaining. Kirsten Dunst leaves a strong impression as Mary Jane, while James Franco too impresses with his cool performance. Rosemary Harris portrays Aunt May very well, while it's Cliff Robertson, whose portrayal of Ben Parker is very emotional and instantly makes you care and cry for him. And J.K. Simmons: do I need to say how great both his acting and comic timing are? The film's action is brilliantly executed and innovative in many ways. Each and every action sequence is explosive and gels perfectly with the screenplay. The film has a lot of classic moments which are still remembered as one of the best ones in a superhero film. The visual effects are phenomenal, as is the editing. Sam Raimi's direction makes it a flawless film which feels like one's own story. Finally, it's the film's action packed climax and an emotionally resonant ending which proves how every superhero who has superpowers, has also many great responsibilities to handle. Seriously, a SPIDER-MAN movie couldn't have been any better than this.
10.0~One of the best comic book adaptions ever!!! plasmahead Sign in Permalink What a masterpiece of work! Whenever I hear a comic book gets adapted for the big movie screen I always got this little "oh oh" feeling. As a very big fan and collector of comics, especially those from Marvel, it hurts like hell when the director don't have this "special sensitivity" for a real good comic-to-big-screen-adaption. But this time I was completely speech- and breathless. From the excellent director's work, the superb actors, the great and powerful score, the fast paced screenplay to the perfect special effects it was just one hell of a good movie ride. Forget all other "Jesus, I am so good" directors, there's only one name that should come up for later comic book adaptions: Sam Raimi. Thanks so much Sam for the best time in cinema I had for years. Spider-Man is destined to win an Oscar! No matter what some other morons say I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars.
8.0~This spider is not so itsy-bitsy TheUnknown837-1 Sign in Permalink This review is the opinion of a film fan who is not very familiar of the original Spider-Man comic books. I judge this movie not on its faithfulness or differences to the series of illustrations and books that got it all started. I judge this just as an action movie. To start off, I'll just say that it's a great way to start a film trilogy. Somewhat flawed, weak at a few small points, but overall, a fun summer blockbuster. It's a good way to kill time on a rainy day. Not everything in "Spider-Man" is entirely original for a film. The main character of Peter Parker sort of develops in a way that has been seen on the screen numerous times before in other films, super-hero movies or not. Going from a somewhat less-than-average person to a figure of great importance. There is a love interest, a best friend, tragedies in his family life, and ultimately, the greatest secret of all. Tobey Maguire is first rate as Peter Parker, he can portray him as being a total college loser and the great Spider-Man at the same time. I am also fond of the performances done by Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. And don't forget Willem Dafoe as the nemesis of the film: the Green Goblin, who I am sure started out in the comic book series, although I can't say for sure. In this era of nearly flawless CGI and special effects, "Spider-Man" stands out as an average achievement. Everything shown in it is believable on screen. There are no spots where a viewer will say "Gee, how fake" or "oh, yeah sure, that's convincing...not". Our two main "super" characters Spider-Man and the Green Goblin were portrayed in great battles through both real performances by the actors and stuntmen, and through the process of bringing them to life using CGI. Overall, a good blend to entertain the audience. I did feel however, that the film's beginning rushed a little fast to be clear on its points. The same thing goes for the ending. It wasn't until "Spider-Man 2" where I found out the real purpose of the ending of this film.
8.0~With great power comes great responsibility cutie_mcpretty Sign in Permalink I really enjoyed this film the first time I saw it, which I was surprised about since I had never been into super hero films before. It had everything; great story, great actors, great special effects... This film is a lot different to the other two, this one had more of a power rangers feel to it where it's two people in suits punching and kicking each other. I was really entertained the whole way through, especially the love triangle between Peter, MJ and Harry. I loved Willam Daffoe's performance as the green goblin, the scenes where he was kind of talking to himself were excellent. Another part I really enjoyed was the scene at the end of spider man web slinging. It was mesmerising. I could have sat there all day and watched it, it was just spectacular. I recommend this film, because it is much more light hearted than the other two and is very entertaining.
7.0~Follows Basic Story of Comic Origin DragonZfiRe Sign in Permalink The cast and crew did a spectacular job. All costumes were great and well thought out, but a few minor changes made me leave wanting more. Peter not making his own web-shooters changed everything for me. The way he was bitten and the green goblin's demise were also slightly different. In the comic Spidey sometimes runs out of web fluid and it makes for comic relief, which is very important for Spider-Man. He is a superhero with a great sense of humor. But even though they changed these things it was still a good comic adaption. Better than Batman, but not as good as Superman. The sequels will be great, the origin movie is always the tough one. They should be able to do some great stories!!!
9.0~A great comic book film adaptation wwwrobbieb Sign in Permalink This film was great. The script was great, the casting was great, the acting itself was great and the story set up for the next 2 movies with the pivotal scene being Spiderman taking the corpse of Norman Osbourne to Normans house and Harry walking in on them. Harry immediately blames Spiderman and this sets up the rocky relationship for both Peter and Harry and Spiderman. Everyone knows the basic story: Peter Parker,the school nerd, gets bitten by a radioactive spider and he gets super powers and he becomes Spiderman. But with every hero there comes a villain,in this case Norman Osbourne, who becomes The Green Goblin! They have their battles but when they are normal people they are friendly and this is where the acting is shown as great.Norman respects Peter more than his own son, and as The Green Goblin, he hates Spiderman more than ever! Like I said this sets up the franchise and it does it very well. It apparently has 1 cameo of another villain but it ain't Dock Ock so who could it be? Well the Lizards alter ego, Dr. Connors, is mentioned only in dialogue so could this be the cameo? Well if anyone knows who this cameo person is I'd love to hear about it! Anyway great film! GO AND WATCH IT!
10.0~I think this movie deserves a high ten, non-stop action and a lot of fun for everyone aBurbine Sign in Permalink I think this is one of the best action movies you could ever see.I think Sam Raimi is a very smart and creative director and the special effects team did a very good job.I liked this movie really because of the show and the comics, they were really fun to read and watch and when I heard there was a movie last year I really wanted to see it, I also like the games, I also liked it because its different, you don't watch a movie with this guy climbing up walls or someone swinging around town on webs and it was so fun to watch I'm going to go see it again.The only thing I have to say is to go see it and find out if its good for yourself.
10.0~In a galaxy of would-be superheroes, Spider-Man is the shining star! budmassey Sign in Permalink Spider-Man has accomplished the impossible. It has managed to rise above the crushing weight of its own hype and actually deliver more than promised. Big screen adaptations rarely mine a fraction of the potential of comic book heroes. Superman was wooden, hopelessly saccharine and lighter than air. Batman was overshadowed by his villians, which may have been the point, but we were left with a thin two-dimensional costume-character and a series of poorly cast portrayals. Even Unbreakable was a plotless and forgettable story that was built around its cast instead of the other way around. X-Men was closer, but was weighed down by its sheer number of characters. Enter Spiderman. Go ahead. You know you want to say it. It's AMAZING! Let's start from the infrastructure. Rosemary Harris (Blow Dry), was virtually unknown despite her long distinguished career in movies, television and the theatre, where she was nominated for a Best Actress Tony (she lost to her daughter). She is perfect as Aunt May, conveying a interior strength and complexity that coexists gracefully with her soft-spoken exterior. Add in J. K. Simmons, whom we have all loved to hate for years as the unctuous Vern Shillinger on HBO's Oz, but may be better known as Dr. Emil Skoda on television's Law and Order. Again, he was exactly the way I pictured J. Jonah Jameson. Randy "The Macho Man" Poffo as Bonesaw McGraw, Larry Joshua [uncredited] (Cop Rock, For Love of the Game) as the unscrupulous fight promoter, and even Cliff Robertson as the ill-fated Uncle Ben, all add to the remarkable synergy that never misses a beat. Now the first string. The sheer genius of selecting Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man was the best way possible to provide an axis for all the other talent to revolve around. He is far and away the best young actor out there, and his understated yet always larger than life presence completely occupies the superhero persona. Stan Lee and Steve Ditko much have been chanelling Maguire forty years ago when they created Spiderman. He is vulnerable, not in the hapless and ultimately hollow Clark Kent way, nor in the damaged and empty Bruce Wayne manner, but in a human and sympathetic way that allows us to empathize and identify with him unlike any other comic book to silver screen alter ego. The chemistry between Maguire and Kisrten Dunst is breathtaking, and the beauty of their star-crossed romance is tragic in the best literary sense, carried off to perfection under the surprisingly mature performances of Dunst and Maguire. Willem Dafoe is the ultimate comic book villian. He is diabolical, and wears his thinly-vieled alter ego as transparently as a mist. He is unrepentant and remorseless as all true villians must be. Dafoe is one of the many casting coups that make this masterpiece work. Sam Raimi, who has had his greatest success as a producer, directs Spider-Man with the skill of a maestro, and delivers an instant classic that works frame to frame from beginning to end in seamless perfection. It was worth all the anticipation, worthy of all the hype, and satisfying in every way. Absolute perfection. My Spider Sense is already tingling for the sequel.
5.0~Not that good mikemapa Sign in Permalink I was disappointed by this movie--the computer animation of Spidey looked fake, simply like a high-tech cartoon, which jarred against rest of the live-action movie. The action was ho-hum and the acting rather wooden all around (what happened to you, Willem Dafoe and Kirsten Dunst?). And sorry, but Tobey Maguire just doesn't inspire any form of sympathy in me, which is a real failing for a superhero movie. I suppose it's watchable, but I have a real hard time recommending it to people. Needless to say, I take issue with its 8+ rating. The best comic book adaptation I've seen so far is Blade 2--fast-paced, action-packed, pulse-pounding, with loads of style. If it's still showing near you, go and see it.
10.0~Sad, sad, sad. People have to loosen up. DaBu-1 Sign in Permalink It's a sad thing that people come out of this movie and say stuff like, "the effects made up the whole movie." Or, "Why can't they focus a little more on the psychological and not the effects?" Well, let me see. Maybe because it's, yes, that's right, A MOVIE!! And, not to mention, A movie that's based on a comic book!! People, stop being so anal retentive and live a little. We've all grown up reading Spider-Man and the like, and Sam Raimi did it right. If you see him on the street, give him a pat on the back and say, "thank you for making my hero come to life." He did. After all, anything's better than that late 70's Spider-Man live action series. 10/10...Easy.
6.0~Great Special Effects emccoy71 Sign in Permalink This movie has incredible special effects. That, in my opinion, is the extent of what makes this a "good" movie. The acting is subpar (with the exception of Willem Defoe). It's a shame more time couldn't have been expended making the plot as exciting as the other Super Hero movies (i.e., Superman, Batman,etc.). Special Effects + mediocre plot + bad casting = So So movie
5.0~Nice visuals, bad dialog, nice sound, mediocre acting andreabilger Sign in Permalink Tobey Maguire is very weak -- my daughter's cartoon drawings have more expression. Kirstin Dunst is really just barely OK but Tobey makes her look good. Some of the dialog between Tobey and Kirstin is literally painful to sit through. The movie is very pretty. The CGI crowd did their job, I just wish the writers had done half as well. My husband is really into sound and said it was good. (I thought so too, but one ear doesn't really work.) The movie started so slowly, we were wondering whether we should give up on it about 20 minutes in. We only give up on about one movie in twenty, so that tells you something. I'd heard good things about Spiderman and thought they applied to both 1 and 2, but I'm starting to suspect (and hope) that they were really about 2.
9.0~great Confidante77 Sign in Permalink I have to say that this used to be one of my favourite movies of all time. Some may have criticized it for being too slow in starting but its the opening scenes which really help the audience build an emotional link with Peter Parker (played to perfection by the excellent Tobey Maguire) and help us feel his feelings- you kind of began to get a crush on MJ yourself. After the poignant and funny opening the film presents us with some thrilling and intense action scenes, such as Peter chasing down the carjacker- we genuinely feel the elation he feels when first webslinging. Best of all the movie proceeds at a great pace and is never boring. Also worth mentioning is Willem Dafoe who suits the role of Norman Osborne down to a "T", his performance is sublime, particularly in the scene which he talks to himself in the mirror- incidentally they filmed this scene all in one take. Definitely worth seeing more than once. PS I also want to say, how can IMDb users say that Spiderman 2 is better than this one?! It's clearly not. While 2 has more glamorous action scenes this one has far more emotional depth and far stronger performances (by the way i'm not saying the 2nd one was bad,just that the first was better)
9.0~Amazing...to coin a phrase tygrkhat40 Sign in Permalink A terrific movie. I'm not a huge Spider-Man fan, but I know enough about the character to say that I did not find any flaws in plot, casting, characterization or continuity. I always thought that Tobey Maguire was an excellent choice for the "everyman" hero an Kirsten Dunst is a real hottie. I also find it interesting that the Marvel stable of heroes are the hot movie properties (Spidey, Blade, X-Men and the upcoming Daredevil and Hulk), while the DC heroes, owned by a movie producer, languish in possibilities.
8.0~Marvel Comics 2, DC Comics Fading Out Fast fishthatwalks Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is most certainly one of the best, if not the best comic book adaptaion of this century, had it been made five years earlier it would have most likely starred Leonardo DiCaprio and would have been directed by James Cameron. No disrespect to Cameron but thank god for Sam Rami and Tobey Maguire, their contributions must have made the great Stan Lee a very happy man. The acting was superb, one of Maguire's best performances and I thought that the balance between action and romance was just right. Hopefully future adaptaions of Marvel comics will follow the examples of Spider-man and other Marvel based movies such as X-Men and we won't end up with another Batman and Robin.
10.0~I'm tired of all the nitpickers. **Possible Spoilers** Spoonmonitor Sign in Permalink Wow people, I'm just shocked that some people not only didn't enjoy this movie, but are just hell-bent on smashing it to pieces. Now, I already posted another review of this movie that infact praises Spider-Man. I gave it a 10 out of 10 rating, and I recommended it to everyone who hadn't seen it yet. I am a true child of the movies, I love going to them, I love Hollywood, and I will love it until the day I die. First off, I'm not trying to come down on anyone in this post, I'm posting a general statement to people who nitpick about movies (but with references to Spider-Man). I'm not an employee of any movie studio, nor am I some marketing exec trying to brainwash you guys. I am nothing more than a movie buff who was pleasantly surprised at what turned out to be a very well crafted movie. Ok, the action left something to be desired, I wish I could have seen some more hand-to-hand combat between Spidey and The Green Goblin. I wish I could have seen some more scenes of Peter Parker discovering his new skills. But as I type this, I am reminded that what makes good movies is the fact that you are left wanting more. Spiderman is a comic that has as many dramatic and heartfelt elements as it does action elements. Sam Raimi did a great job of capturing the motivations of the characters, choosing to develop them rather than have them be pawns being moved from one action scene to the next. Sam Raimi does a similar thing with his classic "Darkman", where our hero is a tortured sole caught between two worlds and must hide his true self away from his loved ones. Tobey Maguire plays the part perfectly, putting just the right amount of geekiness in his character. But even before he gets bitten, there is a twinkle in his eye, I could see something about Peter Parker that was more than just the geek exterior, and it prevented his character from becoming a stereotypical nerd (which a lesser actor would have done easily). Kirsten Dunst is cute, but her wet t-shirt/sweater/dress/whole body scene was purely gratuitous (remember Halle Berry in Swordfish?). I hate her a lot less in this movie than in her other movies, and she was actually convincing as Mary Jane, right down to the hair color. James Franco as Harry Osborn is very good, and looks like he could be Willem Dafoe's son in real life (it's the cheekbones). I'm sure we will see more of Franco's Osborn in the sequel. Which moves us to Willem Dafoe...yes, the mask is a bit halloweenish, but it's a realistic twist on an otherwise unrealistic character. His portrayal of The Green Goblin was dead on, even the voice was good. His performance was multi-layered and very intoxicating. Even as he is going crazy, the scenes with his son are very interesting and even believable. The "talking to the mask" scene was pretty silly, but Dafoe does the best he can, and that's all I ask. All in all, Sam Raimi's Spiderman is a great film. It is one of my all time favorites (along with a laundry list of others)and deserves to be part of the ranks of Batman and Superman. I believe it captured the spirit of the comic book perfectly, and without a "re-imagined" feel to it, it feels authentic and even a little 50's-ish. Finally a summer blockbuster with some substance to it, and a over hyped movie that delivers on its hype (at least in my opinion). Frankly I'm just tired of the nitpickers who insist that everything has to be perfectly adapted from the book. Look people, it's a MOVIE. Our physical representations of feelings we all get from reading the book are not going to be exactly the same as the filmmakers', nor should they be. Let's face it, the movie will almost never be as good as the book, so don't ask it to be. I'm a big reader, and when they turn books into movies, I have certain doubts about the adaptation, but I just sit back and remember that a movie cannot capture everything a book has to offer. As for the people who saw it and didn't like the lack of action...well...I can sympathize, but go see it again, you might appreciate the story more when you see it a second time. The bottom line is that people who viciously nitpick about stuff that they can't do any better themselves are missing out on the good stuff about Spider-Man, and I think that it pays to be a little more realistic when it comes to movies. Let the books be books, and let the movies be movies, and we'll all get along better that way.
4.0~Disappointed nicenick Sign in Permalink Maybe it was the hype that reached England before the film was shown here but I expected more. I'm a big fan of the genre and was expecting something special - Superman, Batman, Darkman, Rocketeer, X-Men even Mystery Men have a lot more to offer when compared with this predictable waffle. I sat the Fifth Element recently and while it too could have been a great film at least it had enough redeeming features that I didn't feel cheated after watching it. Unfortunately Spiderman, in my opinion, didn't have enough redeeming features or to put it another way, I'll watch the Fifth Element again. Try harder next time - please.
7.0~A Great Superhero! kipperblue68 Sign in Permalink Wonderful movie! My 9 year old thinks it's much better than the ps2 game. He wants to save his allowance to buy the movie! And he isn't the greatest at saving. You definately have a winner. Lots of action, good story, and light romance. Great for most of the family. I left my 5 year old home. He would have been frightened by the Green Goblin. ;-)
10.0~Excellent Comic book movie Sriki Sign in Permalink I would say this movie is a Excellent comic book Adaptation. Best comic book hero of all time, I wouldn't say that. When I was a child I was amazed by the movie Superman, I was even amazed by "Spiderman" animated series. It took lots of pains and thinking to make a movie look real. They have achieved the success. The Story builds from How Peter becomes Spiderman. The story is simple but the character building is excellent. Sam is the best choice for the director. The casting choices were excellent. I would say a well directed movie. Now back to the story, Innocent and Weak Peter parker is bitten by a Radio Active Spider and he is transformed in to Spiderman. The best part in this movie is that instead of Web shooters, they thought of genetically generated spider web. If a web shooter was used, I believe this would be nothing but a dumb comic book adaptation.
4.0~Real actors and sets vs. CGI... Ptroinks Sign in Permalink I had kind of high expectations of this movie, and after I saw it, I couldn't stop being puzzled by the poor way computer graphics were used in the film. Yes, a lot of the scenes in the film required some kind of special effects-use (and some actually required the entire shot to be CGI), but to this degree? I don't think so. Just about ALL of the scenes including Spider-Man (as Spider-Man, not Peter Parker) were CGI. And that's OK, I guess, but ONLY if it looks real! By using some sort of mix between using the actor on a blue-screen and CGI, in stead of ONLY using CGI, I think the results would have been much better. If I had brought a pen and some paper with me, I'm pretty sure I could have spotted at least 80-90% of the scenes\shots where computer graphics were used. In particular, I'd like to mention the scene (SMALL SPOILER AHEAD!!!) just after Peter Parker discovers his new "gift". He's running and jumping from roof to roof, and in that entire sequence, there's no Tobey Maguire on screen. It's all CGI, and it's all too visible. The point of CGI (in my opinion) is to help make a scene more interesting and dramatic to tell the story better, but in order to do so, the CGI-usage must be believable. There were a few times, as I watched the movie, where I thought that this should be in a computer game, not in a film. Altogether, the bad CGI in this movie ruined the experience for me. In a computer game, you can get away with it. But not on the big-screen.
10.0~Great Acting Satinewannabe Sign in Permalink The casting for this movie was so well done I can't believe it. Tobey Maguire is perfect in the role of Peter Parker/Spiderman. Willem Dafoe is absolutely wonderful as Norman Osborne/Green Goblin. He brings the perfect edge and conflict that the character needs as well as the sensitivity. Both actors also bring the correct wit to their characters. Effects are very well done. Go and see this awesome piece of cinematic history!
10.0~The most faithful comic to film adaptation ever! mattbw74 Sign in Permalink I must admit right off, I was incredibly biased in favor of Spider-Man before I saw it. I was a huge fan of the comic and an even bigger fan of director Sam Raimi. Heck, I even have the posters for the Evil Dead series on my living room wall. My sister has my favorite childhood chair, which was covered in Spider-Man wallpaper. If this gives you some kind of idea where I'm coming from, and you're looking for an objective review of this movie, you might want to go elsewhere. But if you're a fan of either the comic or Sam Raimi, you'll know where I'm coming from. The reason I say this is the most faithful comic to film adaptation ever is the tone of the movie, not the strict following of the traditional Spider-Man story. The way Peter Parker and Mary Jane meet is different, but their relationship is still remarkably faithful (there's that word again) to the comic, and other things have changed, as well. But in the end, the soul of Spider-Man has been kept intact. And that's no small feat in current Hollywood productions. The humor is still there ("Your friendly neighborhood Spiderman"). The teen angst, and moral questions still abound. My hat's off to Raimi for so successfully distilling the essence of Spiderman, the comic. I look forward to the second one (and possibly Evil Dead 4?) soon from this gifted director who is finally being given his due.
10.0~Great actioner! Opion8d Sign in Permalink *Spider Man* I went in to Spider-Man expecting the same old fight sequence after fight sequence and no substance. Fortunately this was not the case! Spider-man was a great movie with wonderful action and special effects! I mean, c'mon, Spiderman swinging on the walls coming up inches from the ground? That was pretty breathtaking stuff! Tobey McGuire played the part of Peter Parker/Spider-man very well. Everyone, including me, had thier doubts about nerdy little Tobey playing big buff super hero Spider-man. But Tobey proved that he is not only a great actor, but can also be an action star! Kirsten Dunst also did suprisingly well, considering her last few movies were teen flicks. And William Defoe was exceptional as The Green Goblin. The only problem I had with him, and everyone is talking about this, was his costume. He's scarier with out it! I am very happy this wonderful movie shattered the box office records and is on the imdb top 250! It really deserves it because it is a great movie from start to end! *9/10*
9.0~A Superhero With Heart And Soul mpofarrell Sign in Permalink On the surface Sam Raimi's new film adaptation of the 1960's Marvel comic book SPIDER-MAN shares all the ( by now ) familiar elements of your standard , big screen Superhero movie : up-dated surroundings to give the story an identifiable , contemporary look that young audiences can relate to ; a fairly straightforward re-telling of the original source peppered with a few hip "in-jokes" to give the movie a "coolness" quotient ; and last but not least a dozen or so nifty special effects sequences to make the movie worth the price of admission. SPIDER-MAN possesses all these things but it has that little extra something going for it that places it on a higher pedestal than most of the generic action hero adventures of the past. As with 1978's SUPERMAN , the new film has a very likable hero who has two distinct personalities : the nerdy , unassuming good guy in ordinary , everyday life and the transformed , nearly invincible righter of wrongs. It also shares with 1989's BATMAN a colorful , creepy nemesis who hangs out in a Gothic-type mansion and battles the hero in a rousing fight -to-the death finale. SUPERMAN benefited from Christopher Reeve's affable portrayal in the title role , while BATMAN boasted Jack Nicholson's scene -stealing turn as the evil Joker. SPIDER-MAN is blessed with two wonderful actors who infuse the movie with a rare sense of humanity atypical of the genre. Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker , the introverted Queens high school student who gets bitten by a "new" species of spider during a science class field trip. Kind-hearted and sensitive, he is the butt of jokes and an easy target of classroom bullies. He silently pines for the pretty girl next door , who happens to be the love interest of the chief bully. When young Parker is bitten by the runaway spider , he goes through a strange metamorphosis that dramatically alters his life. In the movie's greatest scenes, an expert series of sequences depicting Parker's transformation from intimidated weakling to a force to be reckoned with, director Raimi and his film technicians pull out all the stops. When Parker sits down at his bedroom desk and takes pencil to paper to design a makeshift costume to wear for a wrestling match , the fusion of cinematography , graphics, sound and a mesmerizing music score add up to commercial movie making at its best. The icing on the cake, however , is the unexpected power of Maguire's performance. A veteran of some of the finest American movies of the past several years , including THE ICE STORM and PLEASANTVILLE , Maguire on the surface can seem to be very bland. One of the very few screen actors who doesn't announce his presence with a huge chip on his shoulder, his seemingly placid exterior is deceptive. When Parker suddenly finds a loved one in grave peril , the emotion that Maguire summons up catches the audience off guard. With tears welling in his eyes and a look of stunned grief that in a flash turns to anger, this remarkable young actor raises this action/adventure fantasy to a higher level. The other standout performance is given by Willem Dafoe as Spider-man's adversary , the enterprising scientist Norman Osborne whose evil incarnation into The Green Goblin dominates much of the second ( and weaker ) half of the picture. Because Dafoe is such a strong actor and a tremendous screen presence, he is able to tide the movie over the more conventional story-telling elements that dominate the film's final hour. Dafoe really doesn't offer anything new here , but he is so adept at personifying evil that this viewer finds him compulsively watchable. He may want to reconsider playing this type of role in the future. With his gargoyle-like countenance Dafoe is a popular choice for off-beat roles, especially villains ; however , he is an actor of brilliant diversity and has played everything from the poet T.S. Eliot to Jesus. The enormous success of SPIDER-MAN assures a series of sequels in the up-coming years. Maguire has already signed on for the next production , which certainly can't hurt. But lightning rarely strikes twice, and no matter how good or financially lucrative the next movie might be , I doubt it will have the nascent power that makes the present SPIDER-MAN so distinctive.
5.0~Over-rated artfuldodger9 Sign in Permalink Being hearing impaired, I ahd to pick up the DVD version of Spider-Man (2002) in order to get my first viewing of the film. I was a comic-book geek in the early 1990's, I was a film-fan that followed the legal battles to get "Spider-Man" made on the big screen. I lobbied for people to give Tobey Maguire a chance as Peter Parker because I was a fan of his and I thought he deserved a shot at showing Peter Parker in his full splendor.... That being said, this film pained me to watch it. When watching comic book adaptations, one lists Superman, Batman and X-Men as some of the quality cinematic versions of the Comic genre... Superman put the Man-of-steel into reality, Batman took us the comic book with it's overall production, and X-men mocked itself in order to give a realistic twist to the fantasy. Spider-man does a good job of staying true to some origins and has scenes that are very campy and make you feel like it's a cinematic version of a Comic Book. There are too man flaws in the film however -- the painful-to-watch Kristen Dunst as Mary Jane Watson and her carpet-bagging with boys (oh yes, she is beautiful, yes she is talented - but her smile looked painful and part of her performance I enjoyed most was the rain-soaked scene), Tobey as Peter Parker/Spiderman who I couldn't quite get behind and couldn't quite believe as the nebish and socially inept Parker, and the a-bit-too-CGI Spider-man shots (that were a necessity). With all this negativity, I need to give a nod to James Franco and Willem Dafoe for their portrayals of Harry and Norman Osborne (respectively). Those were characters I got behind.... The antagonist (Dafoe) and his not-quite-good-enough son (Franco). It's very disenchanting when you can get behind the villian before the hero. Suffice it to say, I am very dissappointed in "Spider-Man" as a motion picture. After nearly 20 years of studios feuding to get the right to make this movie, you would think that they would have done a better job with the script, with the characters and with the direction of the film.
10.0~The way a super-hero movie should be. golfextreme1 Sign in Permalink I have been anticipating this film for years and years. On May 3rd, I saw the fruits of my patience. This is, without a doubt, the best comic-book adaptation to date. It shows that a well written and well acted movie can make even the most implausible ideas a reality. I was disappointed to hear other "fans" panning the movie for not staying completely and utterly true to the comics. I have news for those people; if you want to see the comics, go buy one in the store. This is not two dimensional characters with word balloons over their mouths. These are living breathing people with thoughts and emotions in the realm of make-believe. No, it was not a radioactive spider. No, it was organic webshooters, and no, it is not the exact replica of the comics. What it is, is a living, breathing, down to earth fantasy about an average boy on the verge of manhood, who must also come to grips with the "gift" of super-powers. I highly recommend this movie, even to non-comic book fans.
7.0~A Bug's Life. southdavid Sign in Permalink Decided to reappraise Sam Raimi's 2002 initial version of "Spider-Man". My fear was that, given the current sophistication of the MCU and superhero films in general, this vision would might feel juvenile in comparison. I'm happy to report that generally, that wasn't the case. You don't need a synopsis. It's an origin story; bitten by spider, learns powers, Uncle dies (spoiler) and learns to become a hero. His villain in this one is The Green Goblin, played with joyous unrestrained mania by Willem Defoe. Kirsten Dunst is Mary Jane Watson and James Franco is Harry Osborn. There are a few smaller roles filled by actors that went on to greater things. Joe Manganiello plays Flash Thompson and Octavia Spencer plays the wrestling company secretary. It all holds up pretty well, after all this time. There is a lot of Sam Raimi in the movie with trademark tracking shots and overlaying images - as well as more explicit references like the classic Oldsmobile car from the Evil Dead films. The CGI is largely pretty impressive, though there are some moments when the transition to a digital stuntman are obvious - a lot of the film was done practically though and most of that still looks pretty good. The story is strong and the performances are pretty solid too - there are occasional moments that drag you out of it though. The Goblins attack on Aunt May for example, forcing her to complete the "Deliver us from Evil" line is so over the top it's jarring. This portrayal of Spiderman is, if I am honest, probably my least favourite of the most recent three. Nothing against Maguire's choices specifically, but he just feels a little too old and not quite as witty as the two that followed. Defoe leaves no scenery unchewed, but it works as his character is truly psychotic, a fact he acknowledges at one point. It's an excellent, fun adaptation that helped to pave the way for the MCU and some of the great films we have now.
7.0~The way all comic book movies should be DunnDeeDaGreat Sign in Permalink Spider Man is clearly the best movie from comic book ever made. The storyline, action sequences, acting it's all great. The direction by Sam Raimi is some of the best of the year and Tobey Magiure is perefect as Peter Parker. Maigure brings the all amercian to a belvoed alter ego and Kristen Dunst as Mary Jane is sexy and someone who would make a good girlfriend. Willem Dafoe as The Green Gobiln is one of the best villians ever. I give it 10 out of 10.
5.0~A good adaptation, but not quite amazing kmthomas-1 Sign in Permalink Spider Man is hurt by two words; "What if?" What if...James Cameron hadn't backed out. What if...Wes Bentley had gotten the role? What if...they had found someone who could write? What if the guy who directed Darkman hadn't gotten anywhere near it? All that aside... Spider Man was HELPED by a few other factors: Post-911 psyche of American audiences. We wanted a feel good movie, and they gave us one. Next, Toby Maguire surprised me at how well he performed. I never would've guessed this one. Like Christopher Reeve, he came into a role no one thought he'd succeed with, and made it his own. Overall, Spidey's an entertaining flick with SPECTACULAR special effects (CGI/ blue-screening a person in the swinging shots ain't easy, folks), but lacks a dynamic script. It's not on par with the legends of comic-to- movie translations, Superman and Batman (the first films of each), but it'll do.
8.0~solid rendition of the comic books hbs Sign in Permalink Maguire, Dunst, and Dafoe are all much better actors than the material requires, but their performances add to the fun of this movie. And it is a lot fun. (And you'll certainly get a chance to see them again, since this thing has SEQUEL written all over it.) They take a few liberties with the comic book (no, I refuse to call it a graphic novel -- anything with 50 words per page that is less than 100 pages long is not a novel), but I thought that they were generally improvements. The special effects are not really astonishing (although I probably should have been astonished; perhaps I'm just jaded), but they were good enough to not detract from the story (I didn't feel the vertiginous rush during the movie that you get from "Soaring over California" at Disneyland, and the scenes of Spider-Man swinging down the street look like a really good cartoon to me). The movie is good looking and so is the cast (and you get to see a lot of Dunst's cleavage, which I certainly enjoyed). It's a perfect summer movie, a little ahead of the summer. I think that it's too intense for most kids under 10, although there were some kids still in diapers in the theater when I saw it, along with a couple of louts behind me that talked during the movie and kicked my seat repeatedly. And we all liked the movie (although I could have done without the louts).
5.0~Terrible, terrible script cherold Sign in Permalink I just watched 2012's Amazing Spider-Man, and it reminded me of how hugely disappointed I was by this 2002 movie. And I just feel like ranting about it, because ten years later, it still really bugs me. It's funny what I remember from this movie. For example, I remember Peter practicing with his web by shooting it at a soda can. I remember that because I remember how the can was placed to perfectly display the brand name in a way that shouted out THIS IS PRODUCT PLACEMENT! If they had set the can down so the brand name was slightly off center I probably wouldn't remember that now. But that wasn't the problem with the movie. That was fine. I recall it being a cute scene. The problem with the movie was the script seemed to have been written by a bunch of people who weren't reading each other's contributions. The best example of this involved Peter and Mary Jane. Early in the film, Peter is either practicing saying something to MJ or writing something to her - I don't recall which - along the lines of, "you don't really know me even though we live next door blah blah blah." At the end of the movie, MJ makes this speech to Peter about how she realizes he was always there for her. It really aggravated me, because those two tiny segments are opposites that don't belong in the same movie. How can you make a huge, big-budget film and not catch that contradiction? The real problem with this movie, though, is the bad guy. I don't really remember the story, I just remember there really wasn't much of one. The bad guy was lame and it all went nowhere. Overall, this was a terrible series, with only Spider-Man 2 worth watching (and that one was not as good as The Amazing Spider-Man). But what bugs me most of all is how so few people seemed to have noticed what a terrible script this movie had. What's up with that?
6.0~watchable action fantasy undermined by unfaithful adaptation Rovin Sign in Permalink There are two ways to look at Spider-man. One is as a summer escapist movie about a teenager undergoing a startling transformation from nerd to superhero. The other is as the first motion picture based on the 40 year old comic book character. In the first sense, Spider-man is a modestly entertaining summer action pic. The characters are sympathetic and there is just enough story cohesion to make the film satisfying. I didn't feel cheated, but I wasn?t anxious to step in line to see it again either. The dialogue could be mediocre at times, but no worse than some other films of this genre. There were some ridiculously melodramatic touches like the two romantic leads having lived beside each other for 12 years and never having spoken a word to each other but overall the film delivered what it promised. And that was all. But as a longtime Spidey fan I could find some other faults with the film, changes to the accepted history, which in one case actually undermined the film as a coherent drama. Sam Raimi demonstrated that he could visualize a comic book world like no one else with Darkman(1990), although that heavy-handed melodramatic film suffered from a cruel streak--as if mocking the trials and tribulations of the tortured main character. Echoes of Darkman are found throughout Spider-man. Nevertheless, I welcomed the selection of Raimi--until word spread that he had decided that an audience could not accept that a high school science nerd in an IMAGINARY, FICTITIOUS, LARGER THAN LIFE, COMIC BOOK-INSPIRED movie would be able to come up with mechanical webshooter devices--a trademark attribute of the comic book character and every television incarnation. Instead, they would be organic--existing as part of the mutation Peter Parker develops from the spider bite. Now, one could point out that developing super powers from a spider bite is also difficult to accept, as is the idea that a man from another planet who looks completely human could fly around in a red cape and shoot laser beams from his eyes. But alas, the decision was made. High schooler Peter Parker would have to demonstrate his scientific genius by... writing a term paper on nano-technology, and prove his creative genius by being a rather skilled fashion artist and costume designer! Some Hollywood apologists counter that we could not expect any screen time to the webshooter fabrication because of the length of the movie. Nonsense. A one minute-montage would have sufficed. No audience member would have walked out in protest. But the webshooter issue is actually minor in comparison to another change in the origin story. In the comics, Peter originally had no friends, and while he was interested in girls he did not have any particular crush. The decision was made to condense his social experiences so that his later friend Harry Osbourne would be introduced from the beginning(thus removing Parker?s status as a loner) , and to establish that Mary Jane Watson was his destined love(an embellishment not established in the comics until 20 years later). This latter change undermines the story of Peter Parker, devoting far too much screen time to the personal problems of Mary Jane as well as Harry, and creating an awkward moment for the film?s conclusion. In the comics, Peter was always concerned that some super-villain would discover his true identity and hurt his loved ones?-but the manner in which this is conveyed in the film?s final moments is problematic and left some members of the audience I viewed the film with wondering: ?Huh? After all that talk about how he loved her, he rebuffs her advances?? One other change worthy of note: The character of Flash Thompson is reduced to a one dimensional bully, in the comics he tormented Peter Parker but was actually Spider-man?s number one fan. The cast was certainly competent, given the material they were working with. Maguire and Dunst were sufficient in their roles, although i would not say that neither of them embodied the spirit of comic book characters. Maguire's Peter Parker was sympathetic, but subdued, lacking the introspection and expressiveness of his comic book counterpart(and as stated above, wallowing too much on his relationship with Mary Jane). As Spider-man, he did not employ many wise cracks and taunts, another trademark of the comic book and cartoon persona. Dunst's Mary Jane was well played, but her interest in Peter Parker was obvious from the beginning?a very artificial love story. With the exception of the final shot of Spider-man, the FX work relied too much on computer graphics that were not always convincing, and in some cases distant, detracting from an epic feel to the visuals. The biggest design problem would have to be the decision to hide Willem Dafoe?s face under an expressionless helmet rather than make up prosthetics. It detracted from the performance in a couple of key scenes. And the music was truly sub-par. Recycling the tv cartoon theme from the 1960s would have contributed more energy (although they did find a way to incorporate it into the film at one brief point). Overall, Spider-man does not achieve the accomplishment of the original Superman, nor does it fall as flat as Batman.
8.0~Pleasantly surprised HulkVader Sign in Permalink I admit I wasn't expecting too much, but was quite happy with the film. More so than most recent superhero stories, Spider-Man made much more of an effort at back-story and character development, which I appreciate. The casting was appropriate, and I was very pleased all the acting. Maguire portrayed the nerdy Parker and Spider-Man quite well. Kirsten Dunst's performance of the "girl-next-door" was pleasing. Though I wonder if Maguire ever really had to put on the suit until the ending, so much Spider-Man action was CGI! And worthy of note, my nephews (9 and 6) were thrilled with the movie, so everyone was happy!
7.0~Good? Yes. Great? No. ** Spoilers inside ** Oops-3 Sign in Permalink I went to the theater expecting to see something entertaining, yet silly. And that's exactly what I got (Actually the entertainment value was above my expectation). As you probably know, film starts with this nerdy, interested in photography, obviously in love with his next door neighbor student, Peter. Tobey Maguire did an amazing job portraying Peter Parker/Spider-Man throughout the entire movie. Peter then gets bitten by a genetically engineered spider, which matches perfectly with Peter's DNA (or something like that) to create the supernatural powerful creature of spider-man. Now Peter needs to get used to his newly acquired powers. This part of the movie is spectacular (first 30 mins). It's pretty amusing seeing someone going from a nerdy student to a super-natural human being in one night. The school fight scene was the one I enjoyed most. After the first 30 mins, then movie gets ,kind of, repetitive and not as interesting (still good, just not as good). Not to forget the cheesy dialogue thrown here and there. Willem Dafoe was simply.. not appropriate for the role of Green Goblin (which you heard enough about his ridiculous custom). Still the movie was overall enjoyable. Worth the admission price. I recommend it for the genre fans, and anyone whos looking to have some good time. 6.5/10
10.0~The way a super-hero movie should be done A.P. Sign in Permalink After watching camp-fests such as the Batman and Superman movies (as well as most super-hero films), this was a refreshing breath of fresh air. This movie is probably the most realistic superhero movie made so far. You get the feeling that these are normal, everyday people with everyday problems. The only difference is that at least two of these people have super powers. You don't have goofy dialouge like "Chicks dig the car" or lame scenes of Richard Pryor skiing down a skyscraper. Instead, you get VERY believable characters who have to deal with deaths in the family, living on their own, or their best friend going out with their dream-girl behind their backs. I think everyone who watches this movie can find something to relate to.
7.0~Fun but will it last? cuneglasus Sign in Permalink I am not a huge superhero fan,I dont read comics or follow cartoon shows but Spiderman did look good enough on its own merits to go see. I enjoyed it alot.In fact I consider it to be one of the best superhero movies ever made.But I didnt have an urge to see it more than once.The problem was in the overall tone.It felt too hip somehow.At times it felt like a genY music video.The story was simple enough to appeal to the average audience,as you would expect from an origin story but the emotional content was bare.The acting was rather stiff.For example when uncle Ben was killed they passed over it quickly and Peter was back making his wisecracks in no time.Of course this will be a franchise but will it keep up the momentum or become another bad Batman movie?
7.0~With great power (139 million) comes great responsibility (Raimi) zacky902 Sign in Permalink Spiderman There is a scene in director Sam Raimi's Spiderman which pays homage to a film of his past, Evil Dead II. The scene I am describing is where Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) first tests out his powers, as he jumps from building to building in street clothes, inexperienced. When he gets the hang of his powers, he designs his costume meticulously. This scene is a spiritual homage to Evil Dead II's Ash, as he builds his chainsaw weapon and saws the barrel off of his shotgun. And with this, Raimi and Maguire break free of constraints in the film. Maguire's Peter Parker is larger than the movie. He seemingly lives in his own world, where he freely interacts with what goes on around him. Young, in love, and going through a life-changing experience, Maguire fills Spiderman with wonder and excitement. And many critics thought he would not be able to do it. A film adaptation of Spiderman was long thought an impossible, daring feat. Although Superman, Batman, and X-Men have come before this film, Peter Parker was always the most human of all comic-book characters. Bruce Wayne was a bloodthirsty vigilante. Clark Kent was a larger-than-life man with very little weaknesses. The X-Men were un-human characters who relied on each other for strength in battle. Parker has no alliance, only a sense of duty and responsibility. Raimi's Spiderman (which cost roughly 139 million to produce, plus marketing) is a film that shows the struggle of a young man, tackling many responsibilities with an actual concern for his family, friends, and even the strangers he protects. After being bitten by a genetically altered spider during a class field trip, Parker begins changing. He goes to bed sick and wakes up healthy. He no longer needs his glasses. He has muscles. But what sets him physically apart from other healthy people are his strange abilities: he sprouts small hairs on his hands with allow him to climb walls and his wrists have mutated into web-spinning devices. His new powers not only allow him the chance to make some money for himself, whether through wrestling or taking photos of himself, but they also offer the chance to win Mary Jane over, which he will try to do several times throughout the movie. When Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) dies, Peter must re-evaluate his life. Some of Ben's last words to Peter were `With great power comes great responsibility.' This becomes Peter's mantra. It defines what kind of a hero he will become and how he will treat those around him. Saddened by his uncle's death, Peter Parker does indeed become a hero. The people of New York grow to love him. Crooks, criminals, and enemies fear him. While all of this happens to Peter Parker, filthy-rich businessman Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe) is facing some harsh realities. If Oscorp, his company, loses a military contract from the government, the he will be finished. Determined not to let this happen, he experiments his company's new serum on himself. A horrible accident ensues, which leaves Osborne as the multi-personalitied Green Goblin. The Green Goblin is set on destroying the competition, and does just that. Osborne's son Harry (James Franco) is Parker's best friend. And when the Green Goblin learns that Parker may be Spiderman, a game of cat-and-mouse ensues. The Goblin cheezily terrorizes New York. He destroys J. Jonah Jameson's (J.K. Simmons) offices, hospitalizes Parker's aunt May (), and takes Mary Jane hostage. But instead of coming off as a twisted villain with clear goals, Dafoe's Goblin soon degrades into a cheesy, poor man's Jack Nicholson as the Joker. The Green Goblin is neither scary, nor menacing. He's cheesy. As cheesy as the skeleton army in Raimi's Army of Darkness, even. Dafoe as the human Osborne is good, but as the mutant Green Goblin, he's bad. Quite possibly, the Green Goblin is what keeps Spider-man from being a great movie. While Tobey Maguire is very believable in his role, Willem Dafoe is not. Dafoe gets considerably less screen time, but his tongue-in-cheek insults and varied actions come off as second-rate and hold the movie back. Still, the movie has its share of positive moments. The entire first half is great. Maguire flawlessly transforms into the wall-crawler. The supporting cast, particularly J.K. Simmons as media mogul J. Jonah Jameson and Dunst as Mary Jane are very good as well. The second half, while not degrading into a cheese-fest entirely, has some great moments. Spidey, as he swings through his urban jungle, is portrayed exhilaratingly. Good money was spent on decent special effects, most of which take place in the second half. Unfortunately, though, the film does not contain its magic throughout the entire movie. And in the end, Parker is the only character to learn a lesson and then live it: with great power comes great responsibility. Grade: B
9.0~Fantastic! jonpart Sign in Permalink Easily the best film of 2002, I have already seen it twice and want to see it again! The movie was almost flawless...almost. The direction was amazing, although that would be expected of Sam Raimi. Acting was superb on all accounts, especially the tragic turning-point of the movie (I won't give it away), the scenes between Harry and Norman Oswald, and the end. To be honest, I went into this movie expecting to see a regular action movie, like the Scorpion King, but I was pleased beyond belief to see that my favorite super-hero's movie debut was actually emotionally gripping! My only complaint was how the movie skipped the explanation of how Peter developed his new costume (which wasn't a big mystery, but would have been nice to watch) and the parts where the CGI was a little too 'comic-bookish' for my tastes. 9/10!
6.0~6 on a scale of 10 len-21 Sign in Permalink SPOILERS! If I had never seen Superman, then I might have rated this movie higher. Actually, I almost certainly would have rated it a 7. But, it is a TOTAL RIP-OFF of the first Superman movie. Let me count the ways. 1) Youthful boy discovers his powers. 2) Has adopted parents. 3) No other siblings. 4) Father dies unexpectedly and is focal point for future endeavors. 5) Falls in love with girl who doesn't know his identity. 6) Saves girl's life in alley. 7) Saves girl's life while falling from building. 8) Flies everywhere he goes. 9) Metropolis 10) Daily Planet vs XXXXX Planet (I forget the name) 11) Editor of paper obsessed with inside scoop. 12) Real life superhero works for paper. 13) String of bad guys stopped from doing harm. 14) City questions integrity of superhero. 15) Girl falls in love with superhero. 16) Saves girl's life one last time at end of movie. 17) Showdown with arch enemy - which he wins. And, I'm sure I have overlooked some of them. I mean it was ludicrous. I might as well be watching Superman over again. Thank God, they didn't have him changing in a phone booth! Besides that, there were numerous ridiculous events - such as when he got the holy crap beat out of him and yet he showed up at the funeral a couple days later without a scratch. And, how is it possible that she didn't know who he was. Please! And, what was the deal with all her boyfriends. First the big lug in school, then the bad guy's son, then Spiderman, then the superhero. Ridiculous. But, here is my biggest complaint about Spiderman. Where in the hell does all that goo come from? I mean in the space of 30 seconds, he used up more goo than he has in body weight. I mean, please! Lastly, he was grossly miscast in my opinion. If you just want mindless entertainment and you haven't either 1) seen Superman or 2) don't care about the similarities, then go waste a couple hours on it like me.
8.0~Hang On For Fun!!!!!!! meeza Sign in Permalink Directions: To enjoy this review, you must sing along to the Spider-Man theme song. (Chorus) Spider-man, Spider-Man, there is a new little film called `Spider-Man'. Tobey Maguire is Spider-Man, and he could do the job like no one can. This `Maguire' is no dummy, so just `show him the money'. Kirsten Dunst plays Mary Jane, the girl who Spider-Man loves the best. She is cute and has nice breasts but always ends up in a mess. Is it strong? Just go! And you will see why its made lots of dough. (Middle Verse) In the scenes of fright, you will feel some delight. As he glides around, and see what he's found. (More Chorus) Spider-Man, Spider-Man, does whatever a spider can.. (Conclusion Verse) So wherever there is a theater, park your car and put money in the meter. And hang on for Spider-maaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnn! **** Good
9.0~Better than I though synefra Sign in Permalink There have been a slew of movies based on comic book characters, some of them were so horrible that I don't even want to admit I even liked the comic lest someone have only seen the movie and judge my taste by that (see: Punisher or Captain America.. or rather, don't see them). I was never a Spiderman fan. But Sam Raimi is such a god I decided I would go and give it a chance. I was thrilled I did, I am definitely a fan of THIS Spiderman. Which is odd because part of the charm is that they followed the comic storyline so closely that it really did justice to its origins, in fact somehow was better than the comic ever was. I never liked Spiderman, I think because Peter Parker always seemed like such a pansy, he had these great abilities but never seemed to overcome being an annoying geek. Don't get me wrong, I love the geek turns cool' storyline, or geek gets superpowers' but Parker always came up short in my opinion, he never made me care about him. Luckily for me THIS version of Spiderman captured the nature of Peter's geekiness without making him obnoxious. I actually LIKED Peter Parker, and I cared about his character. The film's actors were well worth watching and incredibly engaging. I was thrilled beyond words to see Bruce Campbell and Ted Raimi in their respective roles. I walked out of the theater listening to a myriad of voices saying, `That was great.. ` and even though I had walked in with the opinion I probably wouldn't like it; I had to agree. If you want to see a great film about a superhero, check out Spiderman, its well worth your time and money. I gave it 9 out of 10 because it was exactly what it advertised it was going to be, a great superhero tale, with fantastic acting, and great effects.
1.0~Horrible tiger_lily101 Sign in Permalink Pathetically unoriginal, it is an over-priced, high budget after school special. Terrible script and horrible acting, especially on the part of the incredibly untalented Kirsten Dunst. If you're dying to see this one save your $10 bucks and wait till it comes to Blockbuster where at least you can stop the movie when you realize how bad it is.
7.0~Great visual adaptation, but the spirit is lost.. Karlos-3 Sign in Permalink This movie is probably the BEST visual adaptation of a comic hero. No movie before has every captured a comic hero as closely (from a visual stand point) as this movie has captured Spiderman. The moment Spidey sets out slinging his webs and swinging from building to building, you will get flashbacks from the comics you read when you were young. The interaction between the computer generated spidey, the special effects and the Spiderman played by Tobey is pretty slick. Still, I think the movie failed to capture Spiderman's most important attribute, which is not his web slinging or wall crawling or heightened senses.. It's actually his sense of humour. The attribute that set Spiderman apart from all comic hero's was his constant sarcasm.. Those little bubbles above his head where he would make fun of himself after a bad landing or make fun of Dr.Doom after something he says. This whole aspect of Spidey's character is totally lost in the movie and that is a big blow to any adaptation of Spiderman's comics. The script was not the work of legends, there are many cheesy parts in the movie (especially a whole scene which is totally uncalled for where Spidey saves Marie-Jane from rapists). Acting is done rather well in the movie, Tobey does a great job as the nerd, Dunst is not needed for her role, it is greatly beneath her acting skills and she is too nice to be MJ, but she does pretty well and then there is Willem Dafoe whom I thought was awesome.
8.0~I was a comic book nerd girl... vivianlabertew Sign in Permalink To say I had been anticipating this movie would be a severe understatement. Since my days in elementary school I had day dreamed of a live-action Spider-man movie. I was one of few girls who loved reading comics. One would think that a product of Hollywood would have no chance of living up to such lofty hopes but this does. The special effects are perfect. The plot is original enough to remain interesting but doesn't throw the ideas from its comic book origins out the window. Every character and every relationship is exactly as it should be. Even what some would consider background characters like Jameson are like they stepped directly from the pages of the comic. It's also very well acted. I actually start to tear up when Uncle Ben dies sometimes when i watch it now. I don't know what else to say except I love this movie and it is a true benchmark for movies of its kind.
6.0~Overrated! Solnichka Sign in Permalink This movie was terrible. Why do moviegoers just jump on any bandwagon that comes along? The acting was credible in most places, but the special effects were poor, the plot was ridiculous and after all the hype, I expected more. A lot more. Willem Dafoe is such a great character actor; it was a shame to see him reduced to a cartoon character. Perhaps his best scenes were left on the cutting room floor in an effort to keep the film moving at a brisk pace for mindless droves, but I wonder ... Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are great fun to look at, and their performances are fine. I liked the back-story most: what happened to make Spiderman who he was. Growing up in the 1970s, I watched a lot of episodes of the cartoon series. I can't remember a single one, but I will always remember that little blue and red spider biting Peter Parker in this film. Excellent imagery!
10.0~The best comic book adaption yet!!! Superman_23 Sign in Permalink Plot: A shy nerdy teenager named Peter Parker gets bitten by a radio active spider on a school field trip. Soon after he can shoot webs from his wrists climb walls and he also has spider senses ( I'm sure we all know what the spider senses are right? ok for example if a bullet is coming for him his spider senses will go off and warn him like that he has time to dodge it) Meanwhile Willem Dafoe ( Norman Osborn) has performed a risky experiment on himself at his lab and turns himself into a crazed maniac( The Green Goblin), with super-human strength, who pretty much only cares about world domination. Soon after Peter's uncle dies and Peter lives by his uncle's words ( With great power comes great responsibility ) and becomes the superhero Spiderman. Now Peter has to defend Manhattan against the evil Green Goblin. Opinion: Spiderman was the best comic book adaptation in a long time. I loved every minute of it. Sam Raimi did an incredible job at directing this movie, he's gone a long way he was the director that directed the legendary Evil dead series which I have seen many times. Sam Raimi deserved to direct Spiderman and wow did he ever do a good job. Let's move on to the acting. The casting of this movie was phenomenal. Tobey Maguire is a really talented actor, he was put on earth to play Spiderman. He did a great job and I'm glad they chose him to play the web slinging hero. Kristen Dunst I can't complain she did a great job also. Willem Dafoe I loved the most, his acting is just incredible and he is really talented. James Franco who played Harry Osborne did a good job also. Aunt May and Uncle Ben were also not bad . Now let's move on to the movie itself. The cgi was cool in this movie. I actually know someone that was complaining that it was too fake, what are they going to do throw someone off a building and make him swing with a rope? Also when Spiderman was fighting the people at the armour truck I heard that was cgi, I didn't even notice. Now one thing I really like about this movie is the opening theme with the Danny Elfman song. Danny Elfman is just incredible I love his music from Nightmare before Christmas to Batman he even did the main theme of The Simpsons. Yes ther was a lot of good things in this movie but there were also some flaws for example The Green Goblin's mask what was going on there. When he spoke his lips didn't move his face was still. Its Star Wars all over again ( Darth Vader). Still Goblin was cool with me, his suit was crazy besides for the talking thing its all good. Now I've been waiting to get this out of me. For you comic book geeks, you all start crying because the director made little changes from the comic book. Well I liked it a lot better that he did it this way, the only thing he did was make it more believable do you really think a teenage boy could make web that could hold a train cart full of people come on... you know I'm right even though he is nerd ( well he used to be). Its much better that the web comes out of his wrist and its cool. So over all this movie rocked. Its one of 2002's best movies. Its definitely worth picking up a copy on VHS or DVD. ( I know I will) Mark: B+ Written By: Claudio De Lisi
10.0~KICK-BUTT MOVIE! toddyj1971 Sign in Permalink This was a great movie! I liked every last minute of it. Tobey Maguire was perfect as Peter Parker/Spiderman and Kirsten Dunst was sweet as MJ Watson. I dragged my wife with me to see it and the first thing out of her mouth when we left the theater was that she couldn't wait for the next one. Spriderman is by far the best comic book hero made into a movie. Kudos to the cast and everyone who had anything to do with the making of this film. Excellent job!
1.0~Pretty good until the end. kluenitou Sign in Permalink This movie was pretty good right up until the end. Tobey Maguire is a great actor and he did a great job as Spider-Man. In fact all of the characters were good. Without giving away what happened, parts near the end were completely ludricrous. A non-superhero character possesses more than superhero abilities near the end, apparently disobeying gravity and the laws of physics. Although it was based on a comic book, that doesn't merit characters, supposedly average everyday people, to have outrageous abilities unless he/she is actually the superhero. I guess this is all I can say without giving away a spoiler since most of my qualms are about the end. All in all, I guess I would tell you to see it and make your own decision.
8.0~Spider-Man is Finally Here. anaconda-40658 Sign in Permalink Spider-Man (2002): Dir: Sam Raimi / Cast: Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Willem Dafoe, James Franco, Cliff Robertson: Spider-Man is a superhero of enormous ability yet viewed in the wrong perspective. Tobey Maguire plays high school student Peter Parker who secretly loves fellow student Mary-Jane. On a class trip he is bitten by an unusual breed of spider. Now he can scale buildings and spin webs. His nemesis is the Green Goblin who arrives, as most villains do, by freak accident. Exciting climax where Spider-Man is forced to choose between two factors with the stakes being extreme either way. It is directed by Sam Raimi as a departure from his Evil Dead films. Only Maguire brings a real emotion giving off bewilderment and a sense of awe as he struggles to perfect this new ability. Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane basically plays a damsel and kiss Spider-Man upside down. Willem Dafoe as nemesis Green Goblin falters with little concentration on his personality glitch. This results in a lack of emotion where it should be in the conclusion. And it is no surprise that James Franco as the Goblin's son will grow apart from his best friend Parker with Mary-Jane presented as a wedge. Cliff Robertson provides the pivotal yet somewhat cardboard role of Ben Parker, Peter's uncle. Entertaining visual wonder about abilities and the web of pain that can occur if we misuse our gifts. Score: 8 ½ / 10
8.0~Webtacular! whysoserioushutch Sign in Permalink I remember the hype, all the fuss and the excitement of this film coming out in what seems like all those years ago. I remember seeing it, then seeing it again and loving it even more on the second showing. By the time the two disk special edition DVD came out I pretty much worse the disks out. I was besotted by this film, it's look, it's feel, it's heart, it's characters and it's action. This, coming from a non Spiderman fan! I never liked spider man, I was always a Batman fan but you know what this film did something, it changed my mind about a character who graced the screen in spectacular fashion and caught me well off guard. Spiderman really is amazing in this well shot, well acted and very well directed piece of superhero cinema. The film tells the story of Peter Parker (played wonderfully by Tobey Maguire) a geeky kid with only one friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) and a crush on his next door neighbour MJ (Kirsten Dunst). It's while out on a field trip Peter gets bit by an engineered spider and overnight is gifted or perhaps cursed with spider like abilities. At the same time we have Norman Osborn (Willem Defoe) trying to keep his company beyond the competition with performance enhances. With the army breathing down his neck he takes it upon himself to have a human trial, with life changing results. The film first and foremost has a wonderful pallet of colours that really bring out the comic book feel. Director Sam Raimi gives every scene a wonderful sense of Americana and comic book colours with every single frame of film. At the same time the cast all give wonderful performances to boot. Tobey and James play their friendship and hardships out beautifully, and play the teen angst well. Kirsten Dunt can come across as a little whiny in parts but it's got to be said, in the whole trilogy this her least whiny performance. Of course Willem Defoe dials in the villain performance with pure ease when in green costume yet his most interesting turns come when he is loosing his mind, talking to himself. Great and creepy moments indeed. The action is relentless and the film is soon done and dusted and it really is a thrill a minute, as ever with the superhero genre the origin story is slightly tedious but Raimi sprinkles enough character plot points so it's hardly noticeable. Danny Elfman steps in with his wonderful music scores to provide something almost a little more special than that of his Batman score and that's no mean feat. His music adds real muscle to the action scenes but also heart to the moments where that extra beat is required. It certainly had been a long time since viewing this film but I'm glad to say its aged beautifully. The special effects while slightly (and only slightly) dated look as good as I remembered and of course the ending is worth the wait... Turn up the volume as Elfman's score kicks in to full super heroic melody as spider man soars, swings and sweeps through New York city. Consider me a spider man fan, yes it's all down to you Sam Raimi!
10.0~A Spider Man begger Sign in Permalink "Do you ever feel evil?" This line was not in "Spider-Man"(2002). It is taken from another of Sam Raimi's movies, "A Simple Plan"(1998). However, it applies perfectly to this movie. Sam Raimi provided us, again, with an incredible emotional palette to experience. "Spider-Man" succeeds on so many levels because it convincingly creates feelings that ring so genuinely, that emotionally viewers are captivated by this film. I know that I was. "Spider-Man" drew me in from the opening, no nonsense, credits to the gripping finale. The conflicts, the attractions, the loss, and the incredible verve of this film all flowed together wonderfully, ultimately making one hell of a movie. I could continue all day, describing how amazing each individual actor was, and how perfect Raimi's directing was, and how the story was the best I've seen in a comic-adaption movie ever, and, of course, the amazing special effects, but I'm not going to. "Spider-Man" stands strong without all of this well deserved praise. It does almost everything that I wish from any film, and everything that I want from an action film. In summary, "Spider-Man" is in the same field as many of the greatest films of all time.
9.0~Swing Into Action DTHCinema Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is a comic book movie that stars Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, William Dafoe, was directed by Sam Raimi, was produced by Sony Pictures Entertainment, and has a theatrical run time of 121mins (2hrs1min). Now first a little background, this movie came years before the superhero phenomenon that we have now. At the time there weren't very many successful superhero movies that had been released. Well that was until X-Men which had been released 2 years prior came out. Because of the success of X-Men Sony decided to finally give a superhero movie a sizable budget ($139 Million). This movie finally showed studios that you can give a very large budget to a superhero movie and have it still be successful. In fact at the time this movie was one of the most successful U.S movies ever. Anyways, Now let's get on to the review by starting with a brief synopsis. Peter Parker is a smart, geeky high school student who is bullied by his fellow classmates. That is until he is bit by a radioactive spider which gives him super human strength. He then uses those powers to win money in wrestling. That is until someone close to him dies and teaches him an important lesson on responsibility. He then decides to fight crime and stop those who try to hurt others which includes the villainous Green Goblin. Despite being a story almost everyone knows, It is done quite well knowing how to pace itself in terms of when to be slow and develop characters and when to get straight into the action. It's length of almost exactly 2 hours is a perfect length in which you won't feel unsatisfied or bored due to length. In terms of characters and casting I think they choose almost perfect choices for everyone, Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker is a fantastic choice as Spider-Man because he always comes off as a believable nerd and sure he doesn't crack as many jokes as some may want but personally I prefer a less jokey spider-man to an overly jokey spider-man. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane could have arguably been better and possibly fend for herself more but for what the story and movie needs she's fine. James Franco as Harry Osborn is a great choice, he does the role justice and knows how to feel grief later when his father dies. Speaking of which, William Dafoe is an excellent Green Goblin, not only do I think Green Goblin was a great choice of villain for this movie being just the right skill level for early spidey to face, William Dafoe does an excellent job portraying the crazy and controlled Green Goblin/Norman Osborn. The tone of this movie is just perfect, it doesn't take itself too seriously but also doesn't overdue it. It has good serious moments such as Uncle Ben's death and the final fight fight with Goblin are great examples. Though I will say some of the dialogue in this movie can be quite cheesy especially from Aunt May and a good amount of bad lines from Goblin as well. Then there is the action and effects. Now given that this is from 2002 some of the effects have not aged well particularly when he's jumping from building to building. The score for this movie perfectly fits the film though and still holds up today. Also the first fight with Green Goblin can be debatable described as looking like a Power Ranger's fight. Though I will say the final fight definitely makes up for this. It's grounded, more realistic, and doesn't include much shaky cam. Conclusion While this movie may not have aged as well as it could, it still has great casting, good action, some truly fantastic emotional moments, and overall fun tone. While I do want to give this a 9.5 from my own enjoyment some of the problems overall bogged it down a little but still this is an overall fantastic super hero movie that I will not forget any time soon. Rating 9/10 Fantastic
8.0~Excellent Superhero Movie! WadeVC-1 Sign in Permalink Stan Lee's Spider-Man comes to life on the big screen in a big way! One of the best Superhero movies Spider-Man is far better than any of the Superman movies, and slightly better than the original Batman. Spider-Man is sure to get your blood and adrenaline pumping. Acting was superb as were the generous SFX which were well integrated into the film. The story, although based on the fantastic, also contained a very well thought-out human element and overall storyline that keeps the viewer engaged. Willem Dafoe is excellent as the Green Goblin/Norman Osborn, and Toby Maguire was equally excellent as Spider-Man/Peter Parker. Highly entertaining and one that viewers will watch again and again.
9.0~The Amazing Movie transmitter Sign in Permalink I've watched both Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man, and it's only now that I can say how good of a film Spider-Man originally was. While I have little respect for the actor Tobey MacGuire, I am compelled to admit that he did a fantastic job in this role. Likewise, I had very little (positive or negative) to say about Kirsten Dunst since her performance in the Tom Cruise vampire flick eons ago, but Dunst does a terrible job as Spidey's love interest. However, it really is the director's care in nurturing a very solid (and not so cheery) story that makes the film last behind its final frame. Like the first Batman (and if you've read any of the Dark Knigh/Frank Miller's work) it's the human-aspects of the superhero that make an intriguing tragic hero, much in the classic depictions of Jay Gatsby. The second time around, after watching the disappointing SM-2, Spider-Man feels even richer. Kudos to James Franco as the tortured son, and while I'm a big fan of Defoe, he does just enough in the film. (I'd rather just see him again in Platoon or as a vampire, though)
9.0~With Great Power Comes A Great Film danjross29 Sign in Permalink This is a excellent movie with all the comic styled turns and music and overall the only weird bit to this day is how corny the moments are but still I think it deserves 10/10 BUT. I gave it 9 because we may have overlooked some mistakes in the movie and so I show the good things in the movie and the bad things in the movie The Bad: too much unnecessary slow-mo scenes, corny lines and fight scenes look rubbery and effects look rubbery The Good: Tobey is a great nerdy Peter Parker, Sam Raimi directed it, parts stayed true to the comics, the burning tower suspense, great cast, great soundtrack, great plot, excellent scenes, funny scenes were actually funny and even if you know what happens you still laugh So as you can see there are so much great things in this movie that I personally think if anyone hates this I will find you..........................Anyway great film! And I Personally recommend this to Spiderman fans!!!! 9/10
8.0~Greatest super hero movie to date! longliverock955 Sign in Permalink Going into the Spider-Man movie, one cannot expect to see some sort of artistic opus. But that's not to say that this can't be a great movie. In fact, Spider-Man delivers alot more depth than most action flicks. The story line actually makes sense. In so many super hero movies (cough cough Batman cough cough) the rationale used to explain why the superhero or the villain chooses the life that they do seems far-fetched, but you excuse it because its a superhero movie. In Spider-Man, however, we can really believe that Peter Parker would be compelled to become the Amazing Spider Man because of the series of events that led to his Uncle's death. The casting was excellent as well. While many people said that Toby Maguire was wrong for this role, whoever chose to cast him knew what they were doing. People forget that Spider-Man is essentially a nerd. A skinny and innocent looking actor is perfect for this role. William DeFoe did an amazing job with his role, especially the scitzophrenic conversation he has with his own reflection. The rest of the cast does a good job as well. Something that my friend pointed out to me about this movie that I thought was very interesting was that Spider-Man never kills anyone. All the villains die by their own actions, which makes sense since the character of Peter Parker seems too harmless to actually kill anyone. He's out to defend people, never to take the offensive. There are some problems. There are plot holes, like the fact that the police come to arrest Spider-Man when he hasn't done anything, but they are forgivable. Every now and then someone shouts out a cliched line like "We'll meet again Spider-Man!" And the love scenes between Toby Maguire and Kristen Dunst get to be a little over the top from time to time, but otherwise the movie is excellent. This will be added to my DVD collection as soon as it comes out, and I highly reccomend it.
8.0~A light and airy approach to depicting a superhero. Fun! db3 Sign in Permalink SPIDER-MAN ***_ Action, Comedy, Romance / Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst A perfectly ordinary (even geeky) high school student discovers he has special powers after he is bitten by a genetically altered spider. He uses these abilities to fight evil. The first half of the film introduces and fleshes out the characters. I especially enjoyed the tongue-in-cheek style of humor as SPIDER-MAN teaches himself to use his new found abilities. He gets up to speed just in time to save New York City from a succession of two-bit hoods and one evil mastermind. What separates SPIDER-MAN from most action/special-effects movies is this one has a well thought out script! Special-effects are used to illustrate the story rather than the story being written to showcase the latest special-effects. And there's plenty of humor to go around. I really enjoyed this light and airy approach to depicting a superhero. This will likely be the beginning of a long series.
9.0~This movie is almost exactly what i would expect from a Spider-Man movie in this time of age!!! paulyestermonky Sign in Permalink This movie was sooooo Amazing!!! The visuals on this movie was just mind blowing!!! The actors are amazing, the visuals and special effects are amazing!!! The only problem with this movie was the story line. I'm a HUGE MARVEL FAN and they had the story all wrong. The story was similar, but just not correct enough. First of all, in the real story Spider-Man could not make his own webbing from his body. He had to create web cartridges with science!! Plus, the way uncle Ben dies is Drastically incorrect!!! In the real story, uncle Ben dies when a robber breaks into their house, and this robber was a man who robbed the manager of a TV station!! Overall however, this movie blew me away!! I got over the incorrect story line because everything else was simply AMAZING!!! TRUST ME ON MOVIES!!! IF YOU WATCH THE MOVIES I COMMENTED AND READ MY COMMENTS, YOU WILL AGREE!!!
1.0~What a stink-fest onehorsetown Sign in Permalink It is truly amazing what passes for entertainment these days. This movie was a mindless bomb that can only appeal to the intellectually challenged, MTV, FM radio pop culture. Also, somebody please explain to me the appeal of Ms. Dunst? Sure, she has mighty large assets but is there some hint of talent there? Can't wait for the sequel. As the obvious villain in the next film so eloquently quoted in this cinematic treat, "Somebody Spiderman will pay". However, I will not.
10.0~the only word i can use is GREAT Showtimeracing1 Sign in Permalink this movie had everything in it action, adventure, comedy, thrilling, drama i meen it was just an all around great movie the acting was great and the special effects were out of this world when u sit in that seat in the movies u can almost feel that your swinging side by side with spiderman it was put together so well. Anyone that doesnt like sci fi should watch this cause they will take a different look at things and if love it u will love it even more this movie actually made me go go the spider man comics i hope the sequal to spiderman is even better then this one
10.0~Awesome BrightEyes9685 Sign in Permalink I just totally thought this movie was awesome. I loved the casting, I loved the Special Effects, I loved the story. And now Im spider obsessed....I may never get over it. Its definatly worth it, I may have to spend another 5.75 to see it again.
10.0~''With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility'' moviemaniac008 Sign in Permalink I was about 6 or 7 years old when I first saw this movie. I remember that I was a bit crying when I saw that Uncle Ben had been killed. Sam Raimi had expressed many dramatic scenes like this one very explicitly, so explicitly that I cried. And I usually don't cry when I watch movies.I was given the VHS in Christmas 2002, and I still like watching it. I don't know why, but I liked the Green Goblin character. I found him hilarious. The ending is really cool: The Goblin's board going towards Spidey, and Spider-man doing a backflip in the air as the board's spikes hit the goblin in the chest. And it's so dramatic when Harry Osborne says that if he ever finds Spider-man, he'll kill him. Man, I liked this movie. As I am writing this, I wonder what I will write for the other Spider-Man movies. So good, 2 thumbs up! And Tobey Maguire, James Franco, Kristen Dunst and William Dafoe are really good in character. GOOD JOB!
10.0~The New Millenium's Superhero jerbear2001 Sign in Permalink ***SLIGHT SPOILER*** The 1980's had Superman, the 90's had Batman, and regardless of how much people liked X-men, the new millenium belongs to Spiderman. From it's opening voice-over by Peter Parker, played convincingly by Tobey Maguire, to the long awaited kiss and surprising "rejection" of Mary Jane at the end, this movie gave the audience a feel good aura when they left the theatre. In the movie, we meet Peter Parker, a younger, more nerdy Clark Kent. However, there is one reason why Petey is a better character than Clark. Many of us can relate to Parker. You can't tell me there was never one person you liked or loved in high school, but could never have. We truly believe Peter Parker and his fellow friends are as real to us as our next door neighbor. We honestly cheered the good guy on. We felt good when Spidey kissed MJ, felt even better when we see Peter Parker rip apart his shirt to reveal the Spidey costume underneath (eat your heart out Clark Kent), let out a big "yeah" when Peter Parker kissed MJ. Even the way it ended left you wanting more, when Peter says to MJ they can only be friends, and we get this slight hint that MJ knows he is Spiderman. For anybody needing a pick-me-up, take one ticket, see the movie, and call me in the morning.
8.0~The Superhero of this Century! kemboja Sign in Permalink Whoever doubted Sam Raimi for choosing Toby Maguire ought to be ashamed! He is the holding glue for this movie. He is indeed Peter Parker in flesh! Toby fits the character like a glove, adequately mysterious and nerdy at times. Sam Raimi has made several changes to the original comic character, to fit the big screen i.e. the slight costume change, the wristweb (he changed it to be a genetic mutation instead of a manmade). But instead of destroying it, he endears the character to us mortals by being so human. The transition period when Parker discover his newfound powers was nice too - the euphoric building jumps, the wall scaling, the web dispensing techniques and the wrestling match was really great fun! With the other great actors, Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson and William Dafoe as the Green Goblin(he is always great at playing evil), this show is really tight. Overall, Sam has managed to satiate the hunger of the long anticipating fans of Spiderman and also make it pleasurable for non-fans to watch. In fact, this movie might win legions more fans for Spidey! P/S : Watch for Lucy Lawless as a punk and Bruce Campbell (of the Evil Dead Series) as the ringmaster at the wrestling match.
6.0~not very good at all deatman9 Sign in Permalink This is for sure the best of the series but it still fails in my opinion. The acting is nothing special as with the "special effects" the story line is riddled with holes and problems. This movie is about a teenager who is on a class field trip when a spider suddenly bites him. The spider somehow mixes with his dna and makes him into a super hero. This movie just missed the mark for me. I liked it a lot more the first time i watched it but with every viewing i see more and more problems with it. I really only recommend to little kids or people that aren't prone to point out plot holes.
10.0~It's a true good Vs Evil munch_hughes Sign in Permalink As with any film u can rip it apart and knock it senseless, but this film is true to it's genre. it's a true story of good Vs evil. unlike the superman films there is no weakness like "kriptonit" there is only the weakness of peter parker, which is later exposed. As for the power ranger outfit for the green goblin, i disagree, i believe that the suit was ideal, and the way it was brought in was also clever. some of the grafics used i will admit are not the best, but hey, it can only get better. i used to watch the old Spiderman tv series, the web shooters i never liked. It was always left open to the predictable story line of he gets in a situation and they run out. Toby was great as Spiderman, Defoe was awsome, it only added to his credability. Kirstin, well she is just beautiful and talented, great combo. I am looking forward to the sequel, and hope it is as good as this, which i believe it will be.
6.0~Typical hollywood fare verybored02 Sign in Permalink This is probably the best comic book super hero movie out there. The actors were perfect for their roles and acted them very well. The special effects were pleasing and the action was at a pace to keep you entertained. However, I felt this movie seemed like to much of your typical Hollywood cliché. The love story is nothing that hasn't been seen before and done a million times over nor is the typical movie ending thats been done in a billion action movies the world over. It may be a accurate representation of the comic book, and Spiderman fans are sure to be pleased, the average movie goer as well, but if your looking for something more original you mon as well look elsewhere. 6/10
8.0~Worth the Wait laforge1701 Sign in Permalink I saw this movie on 05/03/2002 and Have to say that it was worth the wait and the hype. If you dont know the story of spiderman, you didn't have a complete childhood, but even if you dont, the story is fully developed, even for the uninitiated. I do agree with what I guess to be one inside joke.. Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst) says that she was told "she needs acting lessons" - Her performance in this film was bit stiff in my opinion, but overall, a wonderful experience. 8.5/10 stars
1.0~Is Tobey Maguire dead? chuck-244 Sign in Permalink Aside from the total lack of a believable plot, I wonder how Tobey Maguire managed to get through the entire movie while actually deceased. To expect us to believe that he would just accept a spider bite from a "super-spider" and not tell anyone is just asking way too much from anyone who has an IQ of at least 75. Also, Tobey's lack of enthusiasm is very contagious even to the audience. I wished that I were dead myself as he relayed to the fake redhead what he had told Spiderman about her. By the time he was done with his monologue I was ready to go ask the theater management for my money back. As the credits began rolling many began to clap and cheer for the movie. At this point I was helpless to hold back any longer as I yelled to the crowd: "Did you people actually SEE the same movie I just did?!"
10.0~Great Comic Book to Movie adaptation jasephilip Sign in Permalink If you are a Spider Man fan, or if you don't know who Spider Man is, this movie is for you. It is a great example of translating a comic book into a movie while retaining the "spirit" of the original story without being bound to it. The origins of Spider Man the comic book hero are different than those of Spider Man the movie hero. Yet I felt that the story was appropriate for today's technology and for the big screen. The sequence of scenes where Peter discovers his super powers made the movie worth while by itself. The character development that turned him into a super hero however, made the movie excellent. The casting of Toby Maguire as Peter Parker/Spidey, worked well. The actor who played JJ Jameson, JK Simmons, was over the top enough to portray the character without being so exaggerated as to be useless. Willem Dafoe did ok as the Green Goblin, but I think the writing (or editing?) let him down where there could have been a bit more done with that character. Kirsten Dunst played the anguished Mary Jane with aplomb. The CG enhancements looked better on the big screen than in some of the earlier commercials, IMHO. And gave Spidey the "super hero" ability that "plain ol' acting" just can't do. All in all I give the movie two thumbs up. More praise would I give it, had I but more thumbs.
6.0~Disappointing chugchug Sign in Permalink I screened the movie last night and I was expecting a lot more out of it. The movie was way too corny and the ending wasn't that great. Tobey Maguire did a reputable job as spiderman. Willem Dafoe was exceptional as spiderman. kirsten Dunst was ok. Disappointing movie
6.0~Every web-slinger has his day. TheHande Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is so far my biggest disappointment when it comes to super-hero movies. Okay, the film had great action-scenes, special-effects and fairly good humour. Problem is that the whole film seemed too distanced from the original comic-book. I didn't mind Spider-Man's web being organic, what I had wanted was to actually hear Peter's internal monologue, similarly to the 90s Spider-Man cartoon and the original comics. It could have provided so much insight and second narrative type energy to the film. As is, it feels like the film-makers exiled me from Parker's mind. Another problem was the villain. Okay, it's true that Spider-Man doesn't exactly have the best villains-galore around, but the film-maker's attempt to actually make the Green Goblin cool just felt like a wasted effort. I just don't find the Green Goblin to be a particularly interesting villain. As such I really felt that this movie did not succeed in bringing the comic to the big screen, and I am only going to see another Spider-Man flick once they give me what I really want, which is Venom.
9.0~Great Action Flik forbiddenblade Sign in Permalink This movie was pretty true to the spiderman of marvel comics. the weblines from glands in his wrists were a change from the homemade webshooters created by peter parker in the comics but it actually made the story better. The goblin kicked butt and mary jane (kirsten dunst) was hotter than ever. Over all awesome movie.
10.0~My expectations were high lobac Sign in Permalink After having waited for over a year for this movie, my expectations were high, and the fact that sam rami was directing didn't do anything to lessen those expectations. Now after finally haven seen the movie, i can without doubt say that this is one of the best movies based on a comic super hero. For me as a spiderman fan, i really enjoyed it, but you don't have to be a fan to enjoy this movie. I think you will be leaving the theater being a fan, regardless of what you thought beforehand. Sam rami has really managed to capture the sense of humor in the comic, and the movie doesn't take itself to seriously. This mixed with amazing action scenes and a timeless love story makes this a movie you can have great expectations going in and it wont let you down.
8.0~Great movie! sidious1 Sign in Permalink I had seen the trailer for this movie a few weeks before the movie appeared in the local cinema, didn't have any high expectations when walking in, but when I walked out of the cinema I was very happy that I decided to go and see this movie! It's great, the acting is great, and the actors play very well together =) This movie is pretty good, definitely one of the best movies I've seen.
6.0~should of used the theme song from the sixties cartoon... The Hankster Sign in Permalink well i sorta enjoyed the movie. having read a fair number of spider hyphen man comics in my younger days made the first part of the movie (about the origins of spidey) a bit boring. only after spidey is seen in his trademark superhero threads do the movie start to get a little more lively. after initially viewing the trailer showing helicopter caught in the giant spider web, i figured they were just going to make a cartoony adaptation but fortunately director sam raimi managed to make the characters realistic and believable for the most part. the special effects however, were a bit of mixed bag. the most bothersome part was having spidey perpetually swinging through the city streets by shooting his webbing seemingly into the sky... kinda reminded me of the corny spiderman cartoon of the 60s. overall not a bad start, hopefully the next installment will be more action oriented. rating :6/10
6.0~A strong Marvel entry stormhawk2019 Sign in Permalink One of Marvel's flagship characters finally makes it to the big screen and with Sam Raimi at the helm, you have a sure-fire winner. The first half of the film is as expected, fantastic. It has just the right balance of humour and action and although Tobey Maguire's acting talents are rather limited, he manages to pull off the dorky charm of Peter Parker with some success. There's a lot of humour in the discovery of his powers and how to use them and the supporting characters are all believable. It also shows the motivations and character development of Spiderman really well and rarely descends into schmaltz. Unfortunately once the tights go on, things are not quite as strong. The Green Goblin was never a particularly interesting character and although the schizophrenia plot line is clever, Defoe holds the attention far more as the disappointed father than a dayglo action figure on a hover board. Raimi handles the action nicely though and it's worth it alone for J. K. Simmons whose hilarious J. Jonah Jameson steals every scene he is in.
8.0~Cool! Jenny Ho Sign in Permalink This is the big event movie' of the year very exciting because everyone has heard of Spider Man the comic book hero who started life as high school geek Peter Parker and became a crime-fighter after he was bitten by a radioactive spider. The only previous comic book adaptations I have cared for are Superman' and Batman'. I was never a comic book reader and I do not care whether these films bear any resemblance to the original comics. All I want is to be entertained and my only question before seeing this film was does it live up to the hype? What makes Spider Man stand out from other big budget blockbusters is that time is spent on providing the background of the hero turning him into a character you can sympathise with and therefore one who is worth rooting for. As Peter comes to terms with the idea that his wrists are capable of projecting a web-like substance and before he learns how to control his super-hero powers, he does what you or I would have learnt from watching cartoons as a kid you point your hands forward and shout Go web!' At first, he is confused by the fact that his glasses suddenly makes his vision blurry and fascinated by his new muscular physique. Tobey Maguire in the lead role ups his hunk status and gives a likeable and endearing performance. The love story of Peter's crush on his neighbour Mary Jane is sweet but never corny and this is credit to Kirsten Dunst who is both appealing and convincing in her role. Willem Dafoe as the scientist Norman Osborn and his alter-ego, Green Goblin makes for an effective villain although I am still bewildered as to why Norman becomes the Green Goblin in the first place! Inevitably, there will be sequels to come and only time will tell whether these will become as tiresome as the Batman' sequels. In the meantime, I suggest that you enjoy the original: Spider-Man' is great summer entertainment which successfully combines humour and action.
3.0~don't believe the hype arnis12 Sign in Permalink Don't believe the hype. This film may have been considered awesome had it been released 15-20 years ago, but it wasn't, and much of the film looks like by -the-numbers after having seen the Superman films, Batman films, and other similiar fare such as the Rocketeer. It' s one cliche after another, starting with the terrible score by Danny Elfman which sounds like a reject from the orginal Batman movie. Aren't there other composers besides John Williams and Danny Elfman who can bring some originality to superhero movies and summer blockbusters? Also, we get the typical montages of a hero discovering his powers and nabbing crooks in the middle of a jewel heist, yawn. The big set piece of the film takes place in the middle of New York during a parade which looks like a setpiece lifted from the original Batman, and the climatic battle is also yawn inducing. How much did this movie cost? Why are the two rivals having a climactic battle in an abandoned warehouse!? Not everthing is bad. Tobey Mcguire does a fine job as Peter Parker, too bad the excellent Willem Dafoe wasn't written a more interesting part. Some of the digital effects are cool, and it was ingenious to have the web shoot out of Peter's wrist, but overall I expected more from Sam Raimi. I was expecting some of the warped, cartoonish nuttiness and excitement he bought to the Evil Dead films or Darkman, however, he shoots this film downright conservatively. The film has a bland, uninteresting look that every polished, by the numbers, major Hollywood film has. Maybe they'll get it right on the second one.
9.0~Top-Notch Movie from a Great Comic everwild Sign in Permalink Very enjoyable movie - a comic book come to life in wonderful fashion. Tobey Maguire was the perfect Spider-Man. The love story was so innocent and beautiful. The casting was perfect in every way. I am anxiously awaiting a sequel. Congratulations.
2.0~Had so much potential amytherat Sign in Permalink This really could have been a better film. Kirsten Dunst plays a whimpy female lead. The whole Green Goblin story could have been scratched in favour of the development of Spiderman himself. the actors really ham it up and the best scene of the twin towers was unfortunately removed - a little too much flag waving substituted in its place. Such a pity they didn't aim this film more at a mature audience. We're not all pre-teenagers & I doubt even the teenagers couldn't help groaning more than a few times.
8.0~A great adaptation!! **Minor spoiler** Blondie_ Sign in Permalink I saw this last Friday and was very pleased with it. To make a live-action version of a comic book is difficult, and Sam Raimi and co. successfully deliver on this one. Tobey Maguire was an excellent casting choice, providing the right bumbling, geeky science-obsessed nerdy high school boy characterization. Like Tim Burton's 'Batman', this film has the correct comic book feel to it, but unlike 'Batman' and 'Dick Tracy', the aesthetics were not made to look comic-bookish. The colors, lights, and buildings, etc. were all normal looking, which IMO fit this movie as it didn't have the intensity that 'Batman' had. The movie was very clever, creative, and humorous. Also unlike 'Batman' as I mentioned, 'Spiderman' was much less intense and less violent. The emphasis seemed to be more on the psychological and humorous aspects of Spiderman rather than the action aspects, which may dissatisfy some true comic book fans. My only complaint-the Green Goblin character. For one, the costume was ridiculously simple and low-key. It looked like something a kid would get from the five-and-dime for Halloween-totally laughable!! How could the filmmakers screw up so badly on that one? I also thought the Green Goblin's demise at the end was too simple and kind of stupid. A better death would of been for him to become the victim of that special ball weapon he had that obliterated people. His son could of heard about Dad's death another way other than to see his body, which obviously wouldn't exist anymore if he was obliterated. Sam Raimi's usual trademark touches of in-your-face, startling action is perfect for the action-movie genre, he was an excellent choice for the Spiderman films. Now the only question is, will the sequel measure up?? I give this film 8/10.
8.0~Poor effects, derivative action, but entertaining nonetheless nedron Sign in Permalink This film was an entertaining 2+ hours, though not nearly as much fun as Raimi's "Darkman". In fact, several bits of action and dialog are lifted directly from Darkman. The most unfortunate part of the film was the reliance on CG character animation. At no point does one ever believe that the vinyl-like characters are real people, a problem that is inherent in the current "state-of-the-art" effects film.
8.0~Another good super hero film gorflax Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is a good film. It is good because much like X-Men and Tim Burton's Batman it takes itself seriously. The story is very close to the comic book which should please fans. The film presents us with the familiar story of an underdog who is subjected to extraordinary circumstances. My only gripe was with the character of the Green Goblin. His suit seemed a bit ridiculous at times and it seemed as if the character should have been developed a bit more before becoming the movie's villain. The dialogue is lacking in some parts and seems to have been hastily written. But these are only small problems as the film is put together rather well. It is highly recommended for people of all ages.
6.0~Great when not just remaking 1978 Superman! educallejero Sign in Permalink So. The first act looks and feels like a normal late 90's movie from the time. There is nothing special. It's ok. The score isn't good. The acting goes from good to bad at random, and the dialogue is kind of weak. Then we get the core of the movie (Uncle Ben scene) and that's perfect. Few comic-book movies justifiy so perfectly the guilt and heroic responsability for the main character. It's awesome. After he gets to be Spiderman, the movie improves a lot and is motly pretty good with some exceptions. MJ "love" relationship with Spiderman is weak and unjustified. Why are Peter and Harry friends? Why is MJ Harry's girlfriend? The movie asks you to believe they all love each other, but we don't see it onscreen in my opinion. Willem Dafoe's Goblin is... ok. Him trying to get to team up with Spiderman isn't though. Why would Spiderman join him? He's on a personal vendetta, even if Spiderman is a criminal, there is no reason for him to join in. Whatever. The movie is fine, and the action sequences pretty great. The movie is funny, just not that great. Good movie overall, with great action, a great hero origin story, but weak and stilted dialogue, ok at best villain, and not always great acting. I liked it more at the time, but it may have been because Kirsten Dunst was, understandably, a super crush for me.
9.0~Lots of fun! GOWBTW Sign in Permalink More and more Marvel comics characters are coming on the big screen. "Spiderman" was worth the watch. I pretty much know the story of the origin of the hero. Bitten by a radioactive spider, got agility, and strength of the arachnid. Can climb the walls like one as well. The big difference in this movie is when Peter Parker(Toby Maguire) shoots the web. This Spiderman has no web-shooters. So Peter has to find out how to shoot the web from his wrists. That was funny. When gets the costume worked out, it's amazing. The people around Parker makes a difference: Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst); Peter's squeeze, Aunt May Parker(Rosemary Harris); a strong mother figure, Harry Osborn(James Franco) Peter's friend who he and his father, Norman(Willem Dafoe) are very disturbing. Norman becomes the maniacal Green Goblin. J.Jonah Jamesom(J.K. Simmons) a tough but slanderous editor of the Daliy Bugle. This movie pans itself out. Liked it from the beginning to the end! Rating 4 out of 5 stars!
10.0~40 years worth waiting! JSpider13 Sign in Permalink I have been waiting for Spider-Man to make it to the big screen my entire life. Its really surreal to finally watch it. 40 years in the making and this movie was well worth it's expensive $9.00 a ticket. The characters were well cast and the acting was top-notch. The story goes by the comic book head-on and captures the comic atmosphere. Along with that, the Fx were above and beyond belief. Some people seem to dislike the film because of the bright look of the film, which wasn't as dark as the 1989 Batman flick. Spider-Man isn't supposed to be that way, and if you read any Spider-Man comics, you would understand why. Some people also disliked it because of the Green Goblin's costume. "it looked goofy and looked like it came out of a Power Rangers episode"...the costume was perfect people. If you took the actual look from the comic book, it would look way too goofy, it's the new millenium. The score was awesome. From the maintitles to the endtitles, Danny Elfman did a great job of keeping the "Superhero" sound of the movie. Overall, this movie was excellent and well worth it's wait.
6.0~with great power comes great responsibility... mgteo Sign in Permalink I've seen this movie in a special screening here in Thessaloniki. I'm not a "Spider-man" fan but I love the work of Sam Raimi. Not all of it... "Blockbuster" and "Good movie" are two different things. This movie confirms that. There are good things about it: lots of humor, a nice guy in the leading role, J.K. Simmons is excellent, the "upside down kissing scene" is great... But, there are lots of bad things to: the visual effects aren't as good as one would expect, the "Green Gobblit outfit" is a disaster, there are lots of cliches over and over... The worst part is the ending and the ideological core of the movie: o.k. you guys, USA is a great nation. But why must the rest of the world see a movie that ends with the American flag? Raimi was better when he did "Darkman". Let's see what he'll do with "Spider-man 2" Sorry for my bad English...
7.0~Avoid if you're over 13, terrible adaption of Spiderman SP-10 Sign in Permalink I don't know where to begin with the mess I saw on the screen last night. I'll start with the acting. Tobey Maguire is a so-so Spiderman sometimes right-on, others just too goofy. Some really bad one-liners in this film. It looks like he's about to laugh when really he's trying to cry- bad acting in my opinion. Dafoe as the Green Goblin was good but the Goblin looked like a Power Ranger character. Dunst is the typical girl role. Kind of average looking but my does she have some assets. I could not believe what I saw during the rain-fight sequence. My lord, the theatre was filled with 8 year olds!! Still my favorite scene in the movie. The storyline & flow is what really puts this movie in the dumpster. Basically there are none. There's no build-up, the end battle just happens. Overall, a bad script & a bland story with bland acting. The special effects are great sometimes but horribly computer generated the next. Note to Hollywood: Please stop adding Matrix style scenes to every freakin action movie. Also, please stop with the "we love New York, we love America themes". We get it OK. We're dealing with post-Sept stuff enough. It's only placed into movies that are so awful they need it for dramatic overtures.
7.0~Good movie, but could be better gremlin75 Sign in Permalink This was a well done movie, but it lacked in the action sequences. The supposed love story, Peter is madly in love with M.J. But at the end, he walks away from her. Doesn't make sense. Another problem I found, was that he didn't feel weird about the powers granted to him by the spider, or does he have to "learn" how to use them. This was a crucial mistake, as I found Peter jumping from building to building with considerable ease, he didn't really have to try to hard to figure out how to shoot webbing, or how to master web-flying as well. As for the plot-line, it is well written, and I can't really see anyone else in the lead roles. Maybe for the next two movies, they might want to actually "slow down" the action scenes, as they were very difficult to follow.
8.0~perfect origin story north-julie Sign in Permalink When young social outcast peter parker is bitten by a genetically modified spider he gains incredible powers that allow him to climb walls, shoot web from his wrist and jump huge distances. At the same time, noted scientist Norman Osborn uses a human genome system modifier on himself and ends up with incredible strength and a very large dose of insanity. The way that these two men use their powers is the crux of the story as parker becomes crime fighter Spiderman and Osborn steals a secret military designed suit of armour and advanced glider and begins a trail of destruction throughout New York as villain the Green Goblin. Spiderman is probably the most lightweight of the comic book films we have seen so far, in that it is not dark and has an abundance of primary colours. It is firmly marketable as a touching and character building film, and has little sense of danger for any of its protagonists. Director Sam Raimi, best known for directing episodes of cult hit Xena: warrior princess has delivered a standard formula superhero flick in the vein of Superman. He has made the film as accessible to a mainstream audience as possible, with no blood or gore, flashy violence and only two deaths (one off screen). As such, for those wanting to see Spiderman in pain or distraught, they will have to watch Spiderman 2. At school, parker is an outcast with only one real friend (Harry Osborn, son of the Green Goblin) and has a long time secret love for fellow student Mary Jane Watson (played easily by the beautiful and talented Kirsten Dunst). Parker has never told anyone about his love for Watson, but it is painfully clear to Harry and his aunt and uncle. His Aunt is Aunt May, played gently and softly by Rosemary Harris who is easily able to show Mays courage and strength when peters uncle is killed. His uncle, Uncle Ben, is portrayed equally well by Cliff Robertson who shines in the few scenes that he has. Meanwhile, the main four characters are all good in their own specific ways. Tobey Maguire, who looks very boyish despite being around 26 years old, is perfect as your local nerd with the heart of gold. He is quiet and insecure until the powers he inherits give him much more confidence. Dunst is able to play a teenage girl any day of the week, and she expertly shows Watsons growing affection to parker. James Franco, at first naive, grows as the film progresses and when his father dies at the hands of Spiderman he swears vengeance. That of course brings us to Norman Osborn/the green goblin. Willem Dafoe is charged with bringing the goblin to life, and without doubt provides a weak link. Talented as he is when simply playing Osborn, he slips into panto villain mode when he becomes the goblin. He isn't helped by the mask he is forced to wear, which looks like a reject from an episode of the power rangers. On the supporting cast is JK Simmons as J Jonah Jameson, head of the daily bugle (where peter gains a job as a photographer after taking pictures of himself as Spiderman and giving them to Jameson, who puts them in his paper). Jameson is exactly the same as he is in the comics, hating Spiderman to such an extent that he uses the Bugle to turn the city against Spiderman. Effects wise, we have some great scenes of Spidey swinging through the big apple (with the best saved till last) but we have the occasional dodgy shot (Spiderman using giant inflatable balloons as trampolines in one of the action scenes) but the effects are adequate enough. Danny Elfmans score is great (with the opening signature tune stunning) and the sound effects such as the sound of the web coming out of peters wrist are done well. On the whole, everything is done with great care, but no real verve. Its a suitable film for all and has great performances from ninety nine percent of its cast. It doesn't push any boundaries or try to delve too much into the darker aspects of superhero life, but as family entertainment and a great story it succeeds admirably. A good film but beaten by its superior sequel which builds on everything here and makes it better.
4.0~Maybe they should have titled this one "The Peter Parker Story" suzythedigbum Sign in Permalink Let me preface this review by stating that I have been a huge Tobey Macquire fan since "The Ice Storm" and was quite shocked that one of my favorite actors (whose work I admired for its delicacy) was cast to play a superhero. I must admit that his doe-eyed innocent charm is perfect for playing a pre-augmented Spider Man and this is the aspect of Spider-Man that works really well. Where this movie falls flat on its face are the horrendously rendered action scenes, which looked like they were produced on computers bought at a RadioShack clearance sale. Even more dissappointing were the scenes between the Green Goblin and Spiderman. Did Sam Raimi totally forget that when in full costume you can't see either actor speak? These scenes could have been dubbed over in Wolof for all the impact they had. In general, this movie is great for getting to know Peter Parker as the awkward kid, but not for understanding how the whole Spiderman altar-ego thing came about. Maybe if they had some scenes of Parker reading Nieztche to figure out what to do with his new-found powers it would be a bit more interesting and relevant, rather than turning the second half of this movie into a technicolor yawn-fest.
9.0~Top Notch Entertainment livingyourpassion Sign in Permalink Spider-man was an awesome action/comic film. With stunning visuals and great action sequences, this is the best comic film since Batman and Batman Returns. Tobey Mcguire was perfectly cast as Peter Parker, and Dafoe can play any villian. He does so perfectly as the Green Goblin. The only knock on this film was at certain times, Spider-man looked to CGI, but besides that, the film rocked on all levels. If you are a fan of the comic book series or even a fan of action films, you'll love this movie. Grade: A-
6.0~A mixed bag... poe426 Sign in Permalink ***SPOILERS*** While it's more or less faithful to its source material, Sam Raimi's Big Screen treatment of SPIDER-MAN often teeters on the verge of outright idiocy. How, for instance, could Peter Parker drag a lunch tray around a high school cafeteria, in front of scores of witnesses, with webbing shot from his wrists... and not be found out??? These lapses in logic (which occur throughout the film) work against the powerful, poignant moments that give the movie its emotional resonance. Nor does it help that the movie often drags laboriously along like Raimi's infamous FOR LOVE OF THE GAME. The fx vacillate between real-life believability and video game cheesiness of the LORD OF THE RINGS variety. On the plus side, there are the performances and a sometimes beautifully moving script and superb cinematography and sets and music and touches of directorial brilliance (as with DARKMAN and much else he's done, Raimi distinguishes himself here as a very capable filmmaker when it comes to fx-heavy material). SPIDER-MAN is a mixed bag, to be sure, but it's definitely worth the price of admission.
9.0~Just what a superhero origin story should be cricketbat Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is just what a superhero origin story should be. Sam Raimi does a fantastic job of showing us the vulnerability of Peter Parker while displaying the awesome power of Spider-Man. And Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin makes a formidable foe for the web-slinger. Yes, they rebooted the franchise, but I still think that was unnecessary because this movie holds up well.
9.0~friendly nieghbourhood spiderman couchpotato100 Sign in Permalink The famous tale of young peter parker. Bitten by a radio-active (or as the film says genetically enginered) spider, he takes on some characteristics. The ability to shoot webs from his arms, stick to walls, spider-strength, spider-agility, and a the in-famous spider-sense. First he takes to wrestling and earning money for number 1, but when his uncle ben is killed by a man he could have stopped he turn to fighting crime. This film was superb. The pace was very fast, there where no boring moments and it didnt drag. with load of amazing bits of CGI including, the chase between uncle-bens killer and peter and the final sequence. Acting was great and so was the directing and by the end of this film you will believe that a man can really spin webs,
10.0~I fell hard..absolutely wonderful angel_91512 Sign in Permalink The movie is highly entertaining, funny, warm,and inspiring. It actually captivated me. All my senses were working. Eyeing every detail, feeling every emotion..I love spiderman's moves. This film will actually and literally make you fall head over heels with the eensy weensy SPiDeRMaN..This film has the adventure, the excellent animation, wonderful actors and staff..the story line is astounding..everything is great and powerful. Moreso, this is a film that is not all a silly blur in a passive mind..It entertains, makes you laugh, smile, still, amazed..It does not have a boring tone at all..It is pure entertainment..intelligently crafted..and the bonus part is that it has a lot of heart..
1.0~horrible indierocker99 Sign in Permalink This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot is weak and jumps around too much. The dialogue is atrocious, and will only reach people with a 3rd grade reading level. The movie is predictable and cliche, and doesn't show anything unique in the script that hasn't already been done. The fight sequences are decent, although they look cartoonish at times. This is what happens when you take great actors and make them into commercialized, blockbuster driven morons
10.0~Absolutely Excellent kamangel18 Sign in Permalink I have never liked Spiderman, in fact I referred to the character as "A giant spider who climbs walls and shoots silly string." I always thought of him as the weakest comic hero. So as you may expect, I wasn't very excited to see it. I figured it would be the typical ordinary, crappily written super hero movie. However, my friend talked me into going to see it. I was amazed! The movie was well written, well acted, and though the computer graphics are obvious, they dont take away from the movie. I have now changed my mind entirely about Spidermanm,he is my favorite hero. It was easily the best movie I have seen in the last 2 years. Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maquire were wonderful in the movie and it probably sent their careers soaring to new heights. Also, Willem DaFoe was excellent as the Green Goblin and James Franco was great. I would recommend this movie to everyone. The person siting next to me was a young boy about 5 years old and behind me there was an elderly couple and all three people enjoyed themselves.If you haven't seen it, you should. I believe you will be pleasantly surprised. Thanks for reading my comment and I hope you enjoy it if you decide to go see it, if you decide not to go see it, you will be missing out on a great movie and a fun experence.
8.0~Simple story, great action, lots of fun stu9003 Sign in Permalink There have been many comic book adaptations over the years. This is one of the best. For the most part, it's fairly faithful to the Spiderman legend. It's not the kind of movie that will make you weep or shout "oscar!" but it is the kind that will remind you of when you were a kid and started reading comics for the first time. The story is very simple and straightforward, the characters are interesting and there is lots of action. I give Raimi credit for not trying to do too much, something that has hurt other comic book movies (like X-Men). The computerized special effects look a little bit fake but given that this is a comic book movie, it actually seems appropriate. If I had to think of one word to describe the movie, it would be "fun". 8/10
1.0~Garish and cartoony CuriosityKilledShawn Sign in Permalink As a fan of Spiderman I was deeply let down by this stupid, gaudy, 'Hollywood' movie version. There are so many things wrong with it I could go on for ages. First of all, it's HORRIBLY miscast. Tobey Maguire is NO Peter Parker, he is so completely wrong for the part. Jake Gyllenhaal could have been much better. Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane Watson seemed like a typical studio-exec choice. Instead of finding someone who could actually be a model/actress with a statuesque figure, real auburn hair with green eyes who could bring some integrity to the part we have ' the hottie from Bring It On who all the teenage guys like'. I personally do not find her attractive and her part in the movie is no more than 'the damsel in distress when necessary to the plot' kind. She's such a stronger character in the comic book and it's been totally ignored here. James Franco as Harry Osborne was useless. I've seen more charismatic performances from furniture. Willem Dafoe was okay as the Green Goblin but some of his dialogue was real bad, it felt like rejected Skeletor jibes from the original He-Man show. He did provoke some sympathy and coped well with the inner-turmoil story but I could not help but think that someone else could have done it better. JK Simmons and Bruce Campbell were the only bright spots among the whole cast. 27-year-old Tobey Maguire plays high school student Peter Parker. A 'boy' who is blessed with web-spinning capabilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider on a field trip. You guessed it, this is another 'origins of' story. I HATE it when comic-book superhero movies feel the need to do this. Honestly, who DOESN'T know who Spiderman is or how he got his powers? The fact that Spiderman is so popular (as a franchise) is the only reason this tawdry-looking movie was a hit. I would have had so much more respect for it if it went straight to the action and didn't waste time setting things up. No superhero movie is willing to do this and it only proves even further that Spiderman was cooked up and packaged in board room meetings. As a way of disguising the fact that the whole thing is no more than processed cheese, eccentric director Sam Raimi was hired to direct. Known for his cheap but whacky movies Raimi had never really done anything big budget before this. The result is a meretricious, mess of a movie that is all over the place. I honestly thought I had walked into some Power Rangers movie. The computer effects are, quite simply, hideous. Who are they honestly trying to fool with this stuff? It boggles the mind how they ended up with an Academy Award nomination. They are really, really bad. The Styrofoam shark in Jaws: The Revenge was more convincing. Danny Elfman cranks out YET ANOTHER superhero movie score for this 'un. It's flat, boring and unimpressive. Aunt May is way too old. The Green Goblin looks like a Power Ranger. The direction is uncontrolled. It's got a poor cast. The story is nothing new or daring (check out the comic books for that). It's assembled by a boardroom committee, not crafted by people who care and it's just loud, dumb entertainment when Spiderman really should be much more. The only part I appreciated was the way they made Spiderman's web biological instead of manufactured. It just makes so much more sense this way. Though there are loads out there who disagree with me. The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen (I seriously think this film would have benefited from and deserved scope-widescreen but no luck) and it looks better than average. There are some color problems and it doesn't look too crisp. The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is typically loud and thumping but it's nothing particularly dynamic. There are quite a few extras if you're really that much of a fan. As I couldn't care any less for this film I can't comment.
10.0~Awesome doesn't begin to describe it! w_bushnell82 Sign in Permalink The first installment of a hopefully prosperous franchise of Spider-Man movies did not disappoint anyone who saw it. Some high budget action movies are just made but this one was created and loved by all involved with it. The key I believe was having Stan Lee as the Executive Producer. He had the final say in what would and would not go into the movie allowing him to have the creative control which made the Spider-Man so successful in the first place. As I was not a fan of the comic book myself I am now after seeing this movie. To start with, the casting agent for this movie should be given much praise. The casting job of Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Willem Dafoe, and James Franco was amazing. Maguire is the excellent Peter Parker. A person who is recognizable as a part of all of us, while at the same time strong enough to stop those who must be stopped. Dunst as the beautiful Mary Jane who is not just a damsel in distress. She is strong willed and has some punch of her own. Dafoe is magnificent as the evil Dr. Osborn who you come to despise and empathize with at the same time. Finally, Franco was a surprising delight in this movie. An awesome young actor Franco gives a great performance as the son of Dafoe who is caught between trying to make his father proud and living down his life of a rich kid. With an awesome cast and a great idea brought to life Stan Lee and Sam Raimi have created a "Marvel"ous masterpiece that will live on for generations to come. If you have not seen this movie, don't tell anyone, go to the movie theater and I guarantee you that it is worth the price of admission and popcorn. Spider-Man tells the story of young Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire). A high school senior who gets bitten by a genetically altered spider while on a field trip that gives him super human abilities. Then after a horrible disaster in his life he vows to live his life fighting crime. Staying true to the comic book through and through, we follow young Peter graduate high school, move to the city and struggle in juggling the aspects of what his life has now become. Like all other boys his age Peter is interested in girls. One in particular, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), whom he has loved since grade school. But, as if his world wasn't messed up enough, it gets flipped upside down when the evil Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) gets into terrorizing the city and only Spider-Man can stop him. With great power comes great responsibility.
4.0~This flick is ALMOST a snoozer... jmh2350 Sign in Permalink If you like slick action sequences, I have some good news and some bad news. First the good news: "Spider-Man" has sharp and fun action sequences! Now the bad news: "Spider-Man" does not have enough sharp and fun action sequences to keep it from bogging down with monotonous and mundane dialogue and sappy characters. Willem Dafoe is the standout actor, but if you want to see him in an intelligent film that doesn't bore or bog down, see "Shadow of the Vampire", or even the older movie, "Platoon". Sadly, anyone over age 14 could skip the "Spider-Man" movie and not miss much.
9.0~basic review thelawrences Sign in Permalink We thought this movie was great fun. Family friendly, fun to watch, no surprises but very entertaining. Willem Dafoe makes a great villain, and Maguire does well as both Peter Parker and Spiderman. We really liked how they showed the spiderman character developing, learning to use his powers, etc.
1.0~Two Thumbs Down For Spiderman (You probably don't want to read this if you liked the movie...) kekadu Sign in Permalink There are multiple reasons why I do not believe that this is a very good movie: 1. Bad acting: Honestly, the acting in this was quite sub-par. They should have spent less time on digital backdrops and special effects and more time on teaching the actors how to act. 2. Too mushy: Spiderman is an action character. This movie is based around love and mushy stuff, which is much different from the comics. 3. Bad acting in the mushy scenes: The mushy scenes might have been alright if the actors had learned how to portray love a bit better. They act awkward gradeschoolers in some parts. The ending fits this description well, in my opinion. 4. Copies other movie styles: I thought it was a bit annoying how in a few scenes they used "The matrix"-type sequences. But that's just me. Oh well... It's too bad it turned out the way it did; it seems as if they could have spent a bit more time on it. The general idea and plot are interesting, but poorly developed in places. Overall, I'd have to give Spiderman two thumbs down.
10.0~Wow!!!!!!!!! devil2di4 Sign in Permalink This movie was absolutely and amazingly brilliant! I have been awaiting the release of this movie for some time now and it was everything I expected and more. Tobey Maguire brings that spark and is amazing as Spider-Man. The costume design and special effects are excellent. If you are in two minds about going to see this movie, make the right decision and go and see it. It's an experience you won't forget for a long time. This movie rocks!!!!!!!
9.0~Amazing Spiderman!! Robert_duder Sign in Permalink I was anxiously awaiting this movie. I expected high flying action, good fun, and a decent movie. What met me was three times that!! Sam Raimi blew me away with what is probably the best Super Hero film ever made. It wasn't dark, but it wasn't light-hearted, the phenomenal thing about this movie was that it was real. The world around Peter Parker and Spiderman was our world. Raimi did not "Comic Book-ize" the world like they did for Batman or Superman movies. It was our world, it was like looking right out our front windows. Tobey Maquire was the ideal choice for the run of the mill kid, who is picked on and misunderstood and pining for the beautiful popular girl. The popular girl is played by Kirsten Dunst who we know can look like a goddess or in this case, truly, actually look like the girl next door. Raimi is brilliant...this movie was filmed in what I call real-life. He took a fantasy about a kid bit by a spider and brought Spiderman into the real world. Maguire and Dunst both look like the average kid and I don't think a lot of make up was used to cover their imperfections and blemishes. Instead Raimi allowed them to look like human beings. The story for Spiderman follows true to the comics. Peter Parker, while on a school trip is bit by a genetically altered Spider and wakes up the next morning, stronger, faster, healthier, with enhanced...well everything. Immediately thinking of his own personal gain, Parker uses his powers to take on a wrestler and when he's cheated by the wrestling promoter he gets even by allowing a crook to rob the Promoter. Moments later Parker discovers that by letting that crook get away his beloved Uncle Ben (who is like Peter's father) is murdered by that crook. From that moment on Peter Parker vows to fight injustice with the words of Uncle Ben ringing in his ears..."with great power, comes great responsibility." This movie spans the course of several years in Peter's life and Raimi covers that whole time without making us feel rushed or crammed together...instead it flows together, and leaves us riveted to the screen. Franco and Dafoe play Father and Son, and Dafoe during a experiment loses his mind and his personality is split into the Green Goblin who uses top secret Military technology to destroy the city. Dafoe is just brilliant as the evil Green Goblin and his alter ego, the suave Dr. Osbourn. Franco who plays Harry Osbourn, Peter Parker's best friend looks and acts so much like Dafoe that they are the most believable father and son in movies in years. The story is so depthy and full of emotion and action. The computer generated effects at times are almost cartoonish which I always HATE but Raimi uses enough effects mixed with live action that it flows well and you don't notice the computerized Spiderman nearly as much. Spiderman himself is also amazing as he should be. The costume and Maquire playing him make him the greatest hero on screen in years. This movie is so fantastic because it is so SIMPLISTIC!! It's like you're watching right down town Hometown. I honestly don't know if Raimi could pull off a sequel with the same quite subtlty and simplicity but I would love to see him try. I would pay the 10 bucks to not only see a sequel but I would even love to see Spiderman again. The running time was the better part of two hours and it was the perfect length. Everything about this movie was just enough of everything. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!! This is the great Blockbuster for the summer!!! 9/10
10.0~awesome rich_reininger Sign in Permalink i went into the theater with very high expectations and was blown away. I wanted to see it so bad that my dad took me out of school to see it. It has something for everybody: action, comedy, drama, suspence, romance. This movie deserves every dollar it makes. Its spectacular. The special effects were sweet, the acting was perfect, and the direction was beautiful. Thank you Sam Raimi.
7.0~Not Too BAD twg4 Sign in Permalink The movie was okay. I mean the graphics were nice and the action was pretty good but it is still just okay. I think X-Men kind of ruined it for real live comics. I still have a bad taste from that one. It had some much potential. But Spiderman was all in all a pretty good movie.
8.0~"Spider-Man" Amazes Again! EmperorNortonII Sign in Permalink This year, "Spider-Man" became an unexpected contender in the summer movie race. I'd say it may not have completely lived up to the hype that was built up for it, but it does deserve the success it's getting. The visual effects are impressive, showing breathtaking acrobatics you'd swear were done by a real human! One thing I appreciate about "Spider-Man" is that it's not too campy. That's a factor that can happen often with comic book superhero movies (i.e., "Batman and Robin"). Tobey Maguire plays his role well, not only as Spider-Man, but as Peter Parker, insecure high school victim. And Kirsten Dunst was well cast as Mary Jane Watson, with her girl-next-door looks. Many comic book purists will scoff at the little liberties taken with the original comic book, such as the organic web spinners and the genetically-enhanced spider, rather than having it be radioactive. (Doesn't quite fit in with the lyric "Is he strong? Listen, bud/He's got radioactive blood," does it?) But then, these people probably also had similar complaints about "Batman" and "X-Men." But it's undeniable that comic books, long dismissed as immature, are becoming more and more accepted in American culture. And comics-adapted movies like "Spider-Man" are helping contribute to that.
7.0~Much better than I expected tomimt Sign in Permalink Spider man has always been my second least favourite (Mickey Mouse holds the first place) comic hero, that's why it was surprising, that I actually liked the Spider-Man movie. Much thanks goes to Sam Raimi, who has shown to us with his previous, and this, movies that he knows how to direct cartoony, yet still greatly flowing live action movies, like Darkman was. And then we have Willem Dafoe, who as Green Goblin steals the whole movie, which wasn't unexpected: villains are always more compiling than the good guys. Tobey Maguire isn't bad as Spider-Man and he tries he's best to make the character as complex as possible and he does deliver couple of funny jokes as Spidey. Kirsten Dunst however is left far too much in the background, so her portrayal as Mary Jane (love interest of Peter and Harry) is anything but complex. So in all pretty good superhero flick, which provided a nice surprise to a non Spider-Man fan.
3.0~Should Have Let James Cameron Direct it... MagnumPI Sign in Permalink This movie starts out great but loses a lot of steam as it changes from a superhero action flick to a soap opera melodrama. The scenes where Spidey kicks butt are great; the special effects are everything that you'd expect as well. The excessive love triangle, romance thing, drag what would have a great movie down in the dirt. James Cameron wanted a shot at this movie after shooting "Titanic." And that's a bloody shame when you consider what he did with "Aliens." (The sequel to "Alien") For whatever reason, things didn't work out with the folks at Marvel. My guess is that Stan Lee wanted the movie to play like the comic series, frame by frame. The problem is that even as a kid reading Spiderman comics I would skip over the frames dwelling on Aunt May and get to the good stuff. Sure, you need some character development; but not to the point where you go to sleep! My 6 year-old son wanted to see this movie so bad. He couldn't keep his eyes open wide enough during the beginning. The second hour (when the movie became "The Mary Jane Story.") he asked me loudly, "Is it almost over?" Several people in the audience laughed. He actually stole the spotlight from Kirsten Dunst (which is nothing to brag about.) Message to Stan Lee: Reconsider letting Cameron script and direct!!!
10.0~Simply amazing mattbez Sign in Permalink This movie was amazing. The only hard part was being a New Yorker and watching it in Boston. A certain scene in New York City actually made me jump from my seat and pump my fist, but alas, the Boston crowd could not relate. Do yourselves a favor and watch this movie in New York! Aside from that, the movie from top to bottom was just great. It did not cater to Hollywood... it was much more "comic booky" than, say, X-Men and Batman. Some parts were a little far-fetched, but after all, we are dealing with a comic book superhero. Leaving the movie theater, there is absolutely nothing you feel the movie lacked. An all-around great experience.
1.0~SUCKED!!! Tapion101 Sign in Permalink This movie sucked BALLS! I aint joking. I LOVE the spider-man comics ever since i was 10 years old. THIS MOVIE RUNIED EVEYRTHING! Except for Dafoe, it was terrible acting. THe speical effects werent "amazing", they were just ok. TOBEY MAGUIRE IS THE WORST PETER PARKER EVER! And Kirsten Dunst, even though she is hot, IS A BAD MJ! BAD BAD BAD MOVIE!
10.0~Stunning, A must see movie agentnat Sign in Permalink Everyone knows how difficult it is to translate a legend such as Spiderman from the comic book to the big screen. There as issues such as storylines, casting, etc. that go way beyond what most of us could even conceive. However, Spiderman pulls it off in a miraculous way. Of course, there are some changes from the comic, but there aren't any bulls*** Hollywood inventions that often appear in "translation" films. The acting is terrific and all the characters were very well casted. The CGI scenes, while obvious, were visually stunning and they are really the only way to show Spiderman in action. Even if I had the chance, there really isn't anything I would want to change in the film (with me, that is VERY rare). I came out of the theater saying it was awesome and I am confident that anyone who sees it will feel the same way. If you are one of the few people who hasn't see it (those B.O. numbers are nearly as stunning as the movie), get to a theater as soon as you can...
10.0~Perfect 10 mwmills1969 Sign in Permalink I was very impressed with this movie, and I give it a perfect 10. I must say that I am normally very critical of movies, and am typically hard to please - for example, I did NOT like Lord of the Rings, for several reasons (such as poor character development). SpiderMan was essentially flawless to me. I did read SpiderMan (and other comics) when I was younger, but I don't think that has swayed my opinion. The acting was excellent, from everyone, and the storyline and direction was superb. It IS a fantasy-type movie, so if you don't like movies where you have to suspend some disbelief, then perhaps you won't like it as much. However, the characters are so compelling, it really pulls you into the story. I thought SpiderMan was considerably better than X-Men. The latter was too short, and the acting - particularly Cyclops, Jean, and Storm - were not nearly as good (I did love Wolverine, though.) SpiderMan, at just about 2 hours, had enough time to develop the characters and story to much greater satisfaction. Bottom line: Unless you really dislike this type of movie, I think you will enjoy SpiderMan. 'Nuff said
7.0~Doing the Things a Spider Can evanston_dad Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi takes a lighthearted approach to bringing everyone's favorite web slinger to the screen, and the result is a comic book movie that actually looks and feels like a comic book, and actually communicates some of the little-kid joy that makes comic book heroes fun in the first place. Tobey Maguire is hopelessly dopey and limited to one facial expression as an actor, but he's good enough for what this role requires. He's equaled in blandness by his love interest Kirsten Dunst. But luckily, the movie around them is spunky enough to make up for their faults. Anyone who'd like an antidote to the brooding "Batman" movies will find this to be a refreshing alternative. Grade: B+
8.0~Much, much better that I originally expected david-sarkies Sign in Permalink I have never really been that much interested in superhero movies, particularly since many of the offerings in the 80's and 90's were pretty average at best. Up until recently the only superhero movie that I really liked was Batman Returns, however this was before the recent offerings from Christopher Nolan appeared, and even then it wasn't until one of my friends sat me down and actually showed me Batman Begins that I actually realised that some of the more recent offerings were actually pretty good. So, it was when Spiderman 3 hit the movies, that I decided to watch the earlier two, and discovering that all three were directed by Sam Rami (better known for the Evil Dead trilogy) that I actually gave this genre another glance. Spiderman has been around since the 60's, though is first appearance was in a compilation comic book. However he quickly became very popular, and has since spawned numerous comic book series, cartoons, and as of recently, three movies. He is also rated as the third most popular superhero (with Wolverine taking out first place). To me Spiderman differs from a lot of the other superheros in that he is simply not a very strong alien (eg Superman) or some rich billionaire (eg Batman and Ironman) but rather a struggling photographer that happened to have been bitten by a spider that had been genetically altered. I am not that familiar with the development of the superhero franchises so I cannot say whether Spiderman took superheros in a new direction, and I can't say that the film does so either. However this film does raise the idea of the superhero as a struggling young boy who lives a double life. While no movie truly follows the comic books (it would be very difficult to do so), we do have the aspects of where Peter Parker starts off as a highschool kid, goes to college, and then tries to make his way in the real world, while living a double life a Spiderman. One of the strange things is that when Peter Parker discovers that he is a superhero, he does not immediately run off and tell everybody. In fact he tries his best to keep it secret. Even in the fight scene where the school bully decides to try and teach him a lesson, he does his best to play it low, buy dodging all of his punches, performing flips in the air, and it is only when he is forced to that he punches back, and it is with this single punch that he pretty much brings the fight to an end. This film, and indeed the other three, seem to focus on the loneliness of being a superhero. He has to keep his identity secret, and while he has friends (and these friendships are tested with his double life) he does not believe that he can really get close to anybody, which is why he quietly rejects MJ at the end. In the comics Spiderman is not alone, he has the entire Marvel universe to interact with, and does have affairs with a number of X-men (including Kitty Pride, aka Shadowcat, and Jean Grey has a crush on him). However he always seems to remain the lone masked figure. Very similar to Wolverine in many respects. In one comic that I read, Wolverine finishes off a whole building of ninja's, and Spiderman makes a cameo, asking if he needs any help, which Wolverine (not surprisingly) politely declines. I do believe that these films capture this loneliness quite well, but it is something that I will explore further once I watch the next two films.
10.0~Made me feel like a kid again ciscokid1970 Sign in Permalink This is the most anticipated movie of all time for me. I have been waiting for special effects to be good enough to create a hero like spider man and make him look lifelike. And most certainly it is one of my all time favorites. No superhero ever created has had the popularity that Spiderman has and his longevity is well Amazing. The reason that most people like Spider Man is that they identify with him is that he is the most "human" of the superheros. He is a teenager with money problems and girl problems and makes mistakes. This movie was beautifully done and stayed true to the character (with only some minor mods). The build up of the character is great and story line moves nicely. The movie covered a lot of ground yet still did not bury you in details. All the actors they got for this did a great job. It is nice that Stan Lee finally got movie making technology to catch up to his fantastic imagination.
9.0~Great movie... I saw it twice the first day. jerry_smart Sign in Permalink I loved this movie. About the only thing I did not like was the language. A few more four letter words than were necessary. If you are going to create a movie with a theme attractive to kids them leave the language out. Come on Hollywood, this should be a no brainer. Other than that the movie was great. Special effects, acting (especially Toby Maguire) and plot elements remained to to the original Marvel Spider-man comics. All in all it was a great movie. I will be buying this one on DVD.
10.0~Fan Oppinion Spider-Pat Sign in Permalink I thought that this was quite the amazing film. The cast was great. They really got into their roles. I really enjoyed the special effects and the sets. I really got into the movie. There were some problems with it that made me only rate it a nine. I was dissapointed in some scence when you could see Norman Osborns face underneath the mask he was wearing. One mistake that I made was that I read the novel before I saw the movied so I thought that there were things that were left out that could have been very useful to the film. Otherwise this was a very enjoyable film that I would see again if I had $12.50.
10.0~love it to death thirteeninthecity Sign in Permalink To be honest when this movie came out when I was in the fourth grade I really didn't want to see it because I thought it was going to be boring. Boy was I wrong. It was terrific. Not only am I a big fan of musicals but I'm also a big fan of Marvel comic movies. No greater one than Spider-Man. Peter Parker is an average guy who loves the beautiful girl. He is accidentally turned into Spider Man because of a spider bite. Tobey Macguire is a excellent Spider Man because of his acting and because of his tight ass. LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!! Anyways the action and suspense makes me want to watch it over and over again. Oh and the upside down scene when he's kissing Mary Jane... totally romantic. Very sexy. I love this movie a lot and it well be remembered for a very long time.
7.0~Entertaining and true in spirit... guirunkaryyk Sign in Permalink I have to admit that I wasn't exactly looking forward to Spiderman, in fact, I was even loathing it, so much so that I'm only now seeing it for the first time on DVD. While I do like Spiderman, lets just say that the execution in super hero movies is very much hit and miss. Luckily, Sam Raimi, himself a fan of everyone's favorite "Non-Mutant Superhero," has a hit on his hands. Visually speaking, Spiderman offers plenty of eye-candy, and while it's not altogether convincing at times, overall, it's quite impressive. The CGI is well-done, and aside from a couple of stiff animations, manages to convince you that you're seeing Spiderman on your screen. While the Green Goblin persona is a bit different visually from the comic's antagonist, it's for the better, and offers me a bit of hope on the level that Marvel will be able to dish out when it gets around to the Iron Man movie. Acting is a mixed back, with some very flat performances by some of the cast, the Dafoe is excellent as the maniacal Green Goblin (wouldn't you love to see him as the Joker in Batman?). Maguire seems wooden at times, but is generally good, and is able to convey a lot of the emotion needed through his facial expressions. The only other notable among the cast would be J.K. Simmons, who nails J. Jonah Jameson to a "T." Once again, Kirsten Dunst is nice to look at, but just doesn't feel right for this role. Overall, though not the best super hero movie to date, it's an entertaining flick that fans of the comic series will love. There have been some changes made from the comic (the "web glands" being one of the more noticeable), but actually work in this case, probably due again to the fact that Raimi is a fan of the material.
8.0~Good, mindless fun SammyK Sign in Permalink It may not be the most intelligent of movies - as are most comic-book adaptations, but "Spider-Man" gets the job done with a good deal of panache, thanks to director Sam Raimi (Evil Dead) and leading men Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe. The problems are few and far between, but they are notable. The live-action Spidey (Maguire) inspires a bit more than his CGI counterpart, though, and some f/x sequences are either clunky (the movements are a bit jittery), or downright derivative (citing 2 Matrix-style sequences). As well, David Koepp's script falters in moments of strained sentimentality. But who am I kidding. This is a good ol' fashioned popcorn movie pleasantly colourful and kinetic!.
7.0~Catches the feel of the comic, but where's Gwen Stacy? DMcD-2 Sign in Permalink I saw "Spider-Man" yesterday with my wife, who is not a comics reader. Both of us enjoyed the movie, which we can best describe as "fun." The acting is passable, largely because the script is only passable. The only outstanding performance is by J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson; he makes the most of a small role and hits the comics character's tone dead-on. While Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe sometimes walk through the movie (except in big dramatic scenes), their performances are satisfying, if not spectacular. Kirsten Dunst, however, is atypically flat as Mary Jane Watson. Dunst was miscast, in my opinion. M.J. is a stunner, a true knockout, the girl who told Peter Parker, upon their first meeting in the comics,"Face it, Tiger! You just hit the jackpot!" She needs to be gorgeous and sexy, and Dunst is pretty and sympathetic. With her round face and sweet demeanor, Dunst would have been well cast as Gwen Stacy, the first true love of Peter's life. ***SPOILER WARNING*** The love of Peter's life, that is, until Spider-Man failed to save her from the Green Goblin, who knocked the unconscious Gwen off the George Washington bridge. Spidey caught her with a webline, but the whiplash of the sudden stop broke her neck. This sequence is more or less recreated during the movie when Mary Jane is dropped off the bridge by the Goblin as Peter faces a "Sophie's Choice" situation -- save M.J. or the tram full of kids. The movie cheats by having Spider-Man defy the law of gravity. By pushing off the bridge with his powerful legs, he manages to accelerate faster than the already falling objects, something which is impossible without artificial propulsion. Peter does this twice in the film, the first time during the World Unity Day battle when he dives past the falling M.J. to catch her and "bungie-web" them both to the ground. I guess love is a powerful motivator. ***END SPOILERS*** Despite this, despite the obvious use of CGI in many of the action sequences, and despite the fact that Spider-Man's mask clearly is a separate piece of cloth when necessary but is connected to the rest of the INCREDIBLE costume most of the time (a problem also seen in the comics), I enjoyed the film a great deal. I do wish Peter had been canny enough to pitch his voice differently when suited up (a basic superhero point that both the Superman and Batman movies have used to good effect). People you know well can recognize your voice, even through a cloth mask! "Spider-Man" is a good, enjoyable movie-movie. It's more fun than "X-Men," certainly more interesting than "Blade," but not quite up there with "Batman Returns" and "Superman." Take a friend, take your spouse if he or she can get into some outrageous action that's more plausible than what you see in the average Schwarzenegger picture. One caveat: During the show I attended, a child no more than five sat down the aisle from me. He seemed to enjoy the show immensely (at least from his smiles when the credits rolled), but my wife and I both thought the picture was too intense for young children during Osborne's tortured multiple personality discussions and the fight scenes -- the brutal final battle most of all. This movie is rated PG-13 with good reason. I know people drag kids no older than 10 to R-rated films, but the MPAA usually isn't kidding when it says "Parents Strongly Cautioned" and "No One Under 17 Admitted Without Parent or Guardian."
9.0~A movie that stays true to the comic books that inspired it. Dark-Man Sign in Permalink Well, the summer movie blockbuster season is upon us again and the first of them to come out (we won't count the dismal THE SCORPION KING as the first, okay?) is SPIDER-MAN. Let me just say that SPIDER-MAN is one of the most enjoyable films so far this year and certainly will be one of the best movies of the summer season. The film has an enjoyable mix of action and excitement. The story is well developed and stays very true to the comic books. The acting (for the most part) is well done. And Sam Raimi's direction is right on. He adds a lot to the comic book style of the film. Perhaps the only real letdown of the film is the performance of Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn / The Green Goblin. Though he is usually a good actor, he just didn't seem to grasp the concept of the evil villain and looked, at times, bored by the material. All in all, the filmmakers did a wonderful job with this film. A lot of comic books adaptations don't live up to or stay true to their source material, but SPIDER-MAN does just that... and does it well. With great power comes great responsibility. Spidey knows it, and apparently so did the filmmakers.
8.0~Near perfect Cross Over - Villains need a lot of work Jack_Acid Sign in Permalink Well, Spidey has been a favorite of mine since before I can remember and I was a bit scared when I heard they were doing a film, only because of the seemingly perpetual flops of comic book adaptations (Xmen, the Batman sequels, the Punisher, etc.) This movie however, for the most part, does Spidey great justice. The way the film is shot and paced, it's very comic book-like, which is great. The action and effects are excellent and the human element between not only Peter Parker and Mary Jane, but between Parker and Harry Osborne, Harry and Norman Osborne, Peter and Aunt May, etc is also very well portrayed. I had only two complaints about the film (POSSIBLE SPOILERS); the first is the lack of wisecracks from Spidey, who has always been notorious for making jokes in the heat of battle against the likes of Goblin, Venom, Sandman, Doc Ock, etc. Though McGuire gets in a few good one liners (usually as Parker), I wish they had included more from Spidey in mid-battle. It sounds like a tacky request, but that's what made Spider-Man so great, his humor. The second complaint is the Green Goblin, a most pathetic villain at best. Willem Dafoe, who I'm sure plays the part as good as he could with the given script, is just a one dimensional foe, mindlessly bombing and gunning down pedestrians. I never found myself hating him or even really caring if he succeeded in his `mad' plans for.whatever he wanted. He was simply a formality of the film, a big bad guy for Spidey to beat. Beyond his lack of purpose, I was deeply disappointed that they used the costume they did. It was the only injustice the film does to the original comic (thank goodness they left Spidey's costume alone!) I was much more inclined to comic artist Alex Ross' design . The GG outfit they used was far too futuristic and plastic looking. Lastly, I truly appreciated the ending (HUGE SPOILERS!); the swelling hatred from Harry towards Spiderman and the broken heart of Mary Jane. Classic sequel setup and very comic-like, leaving us all waiting with anticipation for the next `issue'. Rating: 8/10
10.0~I thought it was great mgchainsaw Sign in Permalink All right, I'm a Spider-Man fan. Have been since I was little. Too lazy to read the Comics, I did see all the cartoons and do remember running around the house screaming "I'm Spider-Man" and pretending to fire webs by pressing the button on my hand and jumping around the house much to my mother's chagrin. What I was hoping for most was that this movie would bring back that joy and inflated sense of self-esteem, and it did all that. I was truly jazzed watching the guy swing around the city (and it did look amazingly believable). The story was pretty much as expected with a few changes here and there. I can roll with that. I do wish that the Goblin wasn't wearing a mask the whole time, but it didn't really do any harm. The movie was just pure escapism, and it was just what I was hoping for. I do wish that some of the scenes in the movie weren't quite as frightening cuz I wish I could bring my 7 year old boy, but I fear nightmare repercussions. If he was 9 I would be happy with the movie the way it is, though. Call me selfish. So, if you're more than 9, go see the movie. I'd be really surprised if you don't like it, unless you really put an effort toward not liking it. Oh, one more thing. I thought Tobey MacGuire was great, and the guy who played Jamison. Kirsten Dunst was pretty good (although I don't really see all the hubbub about her).
5.0~Definitely a comic book movie... wphelan Sign in Permalink I went to go see this movie simply hoping that it would be a couple hours of entertainment. I've neve read a spider man comic book, nor have I seen an episode from the tv series. I guess I'm not particularly a big spider man fan, but I like to give just about any movie a shot. After watching it, I've decided to give it a 5 out of 10. Here's why: I knew it would be outrageous and over the top, like comic books are, but that is not why I rate it fairly low. This movie just wasn't "cool" enough for me. I'm not sure what it was I expected, but it didn't cut it. Don't get me wrong, there were some entertaining and "oh yeah, that's awesome" parts in this flick, but not nearly enough to make up for a weak story. I thought Tobey Maguire did a good enough job acting, as did William Dafoe in his fittingly over the top role as the Green Goblin. Kirsten Dunst also did a fine job with what she was given. In the end, there was nothing particulary redeeming about the movie that would make me recommend it to anyone. I hate to say that nothing happened, because quite a bit of action took place in this movie, but the plot did not really advance very far. There was more style than substance you could say. Perhaps fans of Spider-Man would enjoy this more than I did. It certainly cannot compare to what I consider the best "comic book" movie: Batman. That movie had many more cool moments and a story that moved along and was interesting in a way this film lacked. Once again, I give this movie 5 on a scale of 10.
10.0~love it jimmythoren Sign in Permalink i've been watching the spiderman movies since i was one and still love them i'm sad they're remaking it with a new cast but who knows it could be good my favorite is spiderman 3 it's awesome venom was great but i wish he had more screen time the green goblin was great the costume was new Willem Dafoe was a great pick for the goblin it had the same great things we loved in the comics any spidey fan should see it's great i hope the remakes as good 'cause otherwise i'll wish they wouldn't have changed it all up with actors and creators either way i will see the remake anyway just encase it's good hopefully they'll introduce a new villain that would be awesome.
5.0~the star of the movie is the special effects (sigh...) Allen-31 Sign in Permalink A feel-good superhero action flick. The chief selling point is, of course, the special effects and relentless pace of the action that completely overwhelm the thin script and reduces much of the film to being something like a ride at a major studio theme park. Luckily we are treated to some wonderful acting moments by Tobey Maguire, but there is no acting at all when he's replaced by a CGI Spiderman. It's a shame, really. Christopher Reeve and Micahel Keaton at least got to act when in costume. William Dafoe is always a great actor to watch. (I initially had hoped that he would play The Joker in the original Batman film -- and I stand by my opinion that he would have done as good or better job than Nicholson.) The problem here, of course, is not a CGI issue, it's that you can't see his face behind the Goblin's rigid mask. The woman who played Aunt May was very good. Uncle Ben's part was way too syrup-y with heavy implications. I didn't know the story, and yet I could tell almost instantly that their conversation in the car was the "fateful last conversation they'll ever have which shall cause emotional angst for Peter." Other performances ranged from good to mediocre. It's my personal opinion that the superhero genre is being milked by the studios because of their instant revenue via eye-popping effects, not because they make outstanding films. "Superman" is still the best example of a superhero film that actually had a really good *story* to tell... but that was made back in the days when actors didn't have to compete with special effects. If "Superman" had been made today, it would probably would have featured acting and writing on the scale of the "Lois & Clark" TV series with CGI battles and effects making up more than 50% of the film. I suspect we won't see any more good superhero films until some studio has the balls to do "Watchmen". But hey, maybe that's why "Watchmen" hasn't been made yet -- so much story that it's hard to condense properly into a 2-hour film. Forget the standard 4-star ratings systems these days. That doesn't provide any useful context in today's movie-going reality. Here's a better system: Worth seeing at full price, worth seeing at matinee price, wait for video/DVD, or don't bother even renting it. This movie rates between matinee price and wait for video.
9.0~Good one moviewiz-4 Sign in Permalink This is one of the best Marvel based comic book bring back to the big screen. The story is good and the effects are very amazing. Also, like the humour as well. Keep it up and can wait to see the second installment.
10.0~Most entertaining movie of the year mpb-1 Sign in Permalink Ok, maybe Spider-Man won't win the Oscar for Best Picture. But perhaps that's because it's just too much damn fun. From beginning to end, this movie grabs you and holds you with everything you could want in a great movie. It's got to be the most entertaining movie of the year. Great action, great romance, great acting, and a feel-good movie that makes you think just enough. As for the ending -- perhaps not what you'd expect. And ya gotta give them credit for that. Bring on Spider-Man 2!!!
8.0~Great film stalemilk1 Sign in Permalink I had waited for the Spider-Man movie for a good two years before I saw it opening night, but I had lowered my expectations before coming into the film. Man, I shouldn't have done that. The movie had exceeded my excitement and was well worth the two year wait that I endured. The action was great- how they managed to intersplice computer animation with real life action in some scenes baffled me and the acting was superb (Willem Dafoe's scene at his home in front of the mirror was absolutely incredible). Is the movie for everyone? Probably not, it was a little more "cartoony" than something like x-men or the matrix. But if you're into the sort of thing that the movie Spider-Man stands for, then you can't go wrong and you'll be hard-pressed to find a better movie.
7.0~If only all comic book heroes filmed this well . . . Chris_Docker Sign in Permalink Spider-Man, the movie, knew what it needed to do and got on with it. As a sci-fi comic-strip action adventure adaptation this is one of the best. I am reminded of the tagline "With great power comes great responsibility" when I see how vintage director has handled the special effects. They are colourful, emphasise the story rather than their own technical mastery and have a beauty to them that is almost choreographed in its appropriateness. Tobey Maguire, irresistibly cast as the young lad who grows up to discover he is "Spider-Man" takes to the skies with all the joy of an adolescent with a new toy. Kirsten Dunst is melt-in-the-mouth as MJ. The transition from comic book to celluloid is effortless and an achievement within the genre, with the assistance of veteran writer David Koepp (Panic Room, Stir of Echoes, Mission Impossible, Jurassic Park to name just a few). Of course, Spider-Man, no matter how well done, is not everyone's cup of tea. Nevertheless, it leaves Batman, Superman and even X-Men standing.
10.0~Best movie I've seen lately! jasons_the_man_2000 Sign in Permalink I saw Spiderman at 10:00 on opening night, and it was awesome! The digital effects were breathtaking and the acting was first class. The story stuck very close to my favorite comic series though some things were left out, but then again you can't include every single thing in 2 hours. It was great. I would recommend it to everyone including children although the villian's laugh may scare very young children.
8.0~Definitely exceeded my expectations! TheLittleSongbird Sign in Permalink I am not into action films particularly,(I'm 17) but this was a really pleasant surprise. This is a well-designed, well-acted and well-directed film, that is close to the comics, which my younger brother used to collect. I loved the music score by Danny Elfman, very like Batman. The special effects were excellent, especially with the scene on the bridge, and the direction from Sam Raimi was fast-paced and secure. But for me, the acting was the best aspect of the movie. Tobey Maguire was the biggest surprise. Usually actors playing comic book heroes are bland, but Maguire was not that at all. If anything he was very charming. Kirsten Dunst portrays the thankless role of the damsel in distress, and I must say, she is very impressive. J.K Simmons gets the most laughs as Jameson, but the best actor was Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin. He not only looked the part of the Green Goblin, but brought some welcome gravitas to the role. The story is sweet and sometimes poignant towards the beginning, though the only real complaints I have of this movie is that the script at times is a little uneven, and the film is a bit long. All in all, a satisfying take on the comic book hero. 8/10 Bethany Cox.
5.0~Faithfull adaptation, good performances, but slow seawalker Sign in Permalink It has been a good many years since I read a `Spider-Man' comic and I would say that, failing lapses in memory, this was a very faithful adaptation. Yes, there are probably minor points that the hardcore fans would object to - the organic webshooters, Mary Jane Watson's white trash background, the Green Goblin's outfit, the different circumstances that lead to Peter Parker's first meeting with the mugger that would change his life - but these were minor and did not affect the the story. What absolute perfect casting Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe were as the leads. Tobey Maguire  fine actor as we all knew, but I was especially impressed with Willem Dafoe. Like many people before the film went into production I read that the part of the Green Goblin had been offered to John Malkovich, and I was sad that he eventually decided to turn the part down. Now I would say that I could not imagine any other actor but Willem Dafoe in the role. He was brilliant. And as for Kirsten Dunstshe has become a very beautiful and attractive woman, probably the only qualification required for the part of Mary Jane Watson. There are a couple of criticisms. The special effects were not what they could have been. Everybody has said that. Post-production haste? The film also suffered in exactly the same way as the first Christopher Reeve `Superman' in that it was too slow and too long. It seemed that there was an awful lot of essential back story to fill in, and the film does fill it all in, and at great length. But, saying that, now that the back story is out of the way, `Spider-Man 2' looks like it could be a total classic in much the same way that `Superman 2' was a total classic of its kind. And I do hope that Sam Neill does play Dr. Octopus!
10.0~Great movie! hanniballe11752 Sign in Permalink At last! I just got back from seeing the new spiderman movie and let tell you-it was da bomb! This is the movie to see this summer!Its a rare blockbuster that will deserve its status cause unlike other movies of this genre it relies on good old fashioned story insted of shoddy cgi effects. And what a story it is! A crowd pleaser done right!With any luck the sequels it won't go the way of the Batman series! Oh and one more thing-like Christopher Reeve,and Micheal Keaton before him, Tobey Mcguire IS SPIDERMAN. Sure, the villan lacked a little, but he was sufficiently...hissable. A 10/10!
10.0~Great comic book film, but a little bit on the corny side. ironbutterfly Sign in Permalink I believe that Spider-Man is the best comic book movie there is, but that is half compliment and half insult. Superman, Batman, and X-Men all suffered from the same thing; they all had a weak plot. Superman's ending was an utter cop out. Batman really didn't have a plot if you think about it, it was just moody. X-Men was completely rushed and Magnito's plan for mutant acceptance or whatever he wanted was stupid. Spider-Man had a much better plot (Still don't know what Green Goblin whole plan was. He already murdered his enemies, then what)but the dialog was corny. That whole hospital scene where Peter talks to MJ needs to go. Plus, Harry and J Jonah Jamerson should had been in it more. I don't know why Harry and Peter were hanging out together because in the movie I could clearly see that they really didn't like each other too much, but in the comic they were two peas in a pod. Peter's character should had been more like MTV's Daria/Chandler on Friends. He wasn't funny at all in this movie and that made Peter stand out as a character other than he being the only normal/down to earth superhero in comicbook land (Standing Ovation to Stan Lee). Also I did not like Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. I would have chosen Eliza Cuthbert from 24 or Sarah Michelle Gellar, but they seemed more of Gwen Stacy candidates than Mary Jane. I had read the book version of the Spider-Man movie, and it is 10 times better than the actual movie, and it is based off of it. The 9/11 stuff had to go as well. I know it happened. America knows it happened, so I don't need to be reminded of it in a super hero movie. That was an extremely BAD mistake and it brought down the whole movie. The music on further note was awful. I have bad expectations for the Daredevil movie, but geez I heard some of the music to the soundtrack and it is 10 times better than Spider-Man's. Danny Elfman totally failed me. This is the person who brought us the theme to Batman and The Simpsons. The trailer music by E.S. Posthumus should had been the theme song. Next time get the composer from the Disney animated series "Gargoyles" because he composed a great theme. Theme songs are one of the best parts in a superhero movie, that is another thing why X-Men gone wrong. Last and most is the action scenes. I really didn't care about the CGI. People thought it look fake, but I thought it looked fine, along with the Green Goblin costume, but that, along with my review is my opinion. They should have gotten Yuen Woo Ping and mimic "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon's," fighting moves or have "Cirque de Soleil" choreograph the movie. It's SPIDER-MAN, the master of strings. Who cares if people say, "How can a teen-ager know how to do all those fighting moves." Just leave that question with the, "How can a teen-ager make a foam latex superhero outfit to fight crime, he just can." Like I said before, this movie is the best comic book adaption, but that isn't saying much. There were many flaws in this movie and I expected more from the person who wrote the brilliant script "Panic Room." Tobey Maguire was the perfect choice to play Peter Parker. Wes Bentley would just had made Peter look like the American Beauty role he played. The movie deserved all the money it racked in and I hope it still stays at number 1 of the highest billed movies to bring in the most money in the first weekend. Daredevil would probably suck like Tomb Raider. The movie is mostly hyped by the commercials, but when you watch it, it is awful because Mark Steven Johnson is cramming in 20 years of Daredevil comics into one movie by having so many characters in the first movie, while he could easily put half of them in the sequel that we all know is coming in 2005 of 06. I applaud the screenwriter for not cramming all the comics into Spider-Man, but I hope he corrects some of the mistakes he did in the first one for the sequel.
8.0~Stunning depiction of the comic EnglishInWhat Sign in Permalink This is THE best superhero movie I've seen to date. Seeing Spider-Man on the screen was a thrilling realization of 15 years of imagination. Sam Raimi did an incredible job letting the viewer truly experience webslinging. It was mindblowing!!
8.0~El Hombre Arana ROCKS! eduardouvasquez Sign in Permalink First of all, I want to say that I'm a HUGE Spider-Man fan. Been a fan of Marvel comics in general since I was a kid. I like the fact that the Marvel superheroes have super-powers but are also human and have human weaknesses. I love the Spider-Man saga and have been waiting for a Spider-Man movie since the 60s cartoon and late 70s TV show. That being said, I thoroughly ENJOYED this movie. I came in with little expectations since I didn't particularly like the trailers for the movie. I love Sam Raimi's direction in the movie. Tobey Macguire and Wilem Dafoe do excellent acting jobs as Spider-Man and his arch menesis The Green Goblin. I also enjoyed the early special effects scenes that showed Peter Parker learning to use his new Spider-powers. My only critism was the wack Green Goblin mask(one critic called it an Ultraman mask) and the anti-climatic ending. The cheesy dialogue was tolerable because it was true to the comic book feel of the movie. I will say that I saw it on May 3 when it came out and saw it twice already. The audience was enthralled with the movie, laughing and eating up every minute of it. The CGI/computer digital effects were cool for the most part. This bodes well for other Marvel movies coming out in 2003 such as "The Hulk" and "Daredvevil" which should also be good. I can't wait to for Spider-Man II & III to see the other great villains; Doctor Octopus, Electro, Mysterio, the Lizard, Sandman, Kingpin and Dr. Doom come to life. Kudos to Sam Raimi, Tobey Macguire, Wilem Dafoe and Kirsten Durst for a great movie and comic book adaptation. "Spider-Man" will make 200-300 million easy...
7.0~As good as it gets; but is there enough for more? KevinMHagerman Sign in Permalink If you're a Spider-Man fan like me, then you doubtless enjoyed this respectful retelling of his beginnings; and more than any character in comics, HOW Spider-Man started is crucial to who he is. A man who made a mistake as a boy, and will spend his life fruitlessly trying to atone. I highly recommend this movie. This movie worked, but it had to use a lot of tricks to do so. CGI is the least of it; I enjoyed the effects in the spirit they were presented: to me, they looked so unreal precisely because that is how Spider-Man would appear to move. But the real problem is for a character to have emotional heft when you cannot see his face. They solved that THIS time by having his mask shredded in the film's final battle, which was an excellent physical and emotional one. But they can't do that twice without the artifice showing. Toby Maguire will need to convey things much better through his body language next time. Maybe have a mime consult the next film, or a deaf person who has to rely much more heavily on posture for context.
6.0~Such delightful tosh, but wonderful? No! tbaybars Sign in Permalink What is the hype all about? Because millions of $$ have been spent to make the film? Where did all those millions go? Honestly, this is neither original nor exciting, as fantasy or sf. We have been there before and in worthier company: Superman I and II, Batman, and even Flash Gordon (1980). But the commercial success of the film, not only in the States but also in Europe, testifies to the publicity mechanism of Hollywood; it is not available to poorer companies or countries. The film has acted as an uncouth catalyst in Britain where the trend is towards a neo Victorianism in morals. Some local authorities refused a license to screen it! Unbelievable in 2002. There is more realistic violence in half an hour in any of the dozens of serials on tv screens than in the whole two hours of Spiderman. In France, I watched one afternoon in this holiday season, in a provincial cinema packed with children(with their parents, I ought to add) who never stopped giggling throughout. That's what it is! Just a good giggle. No more, no less.
8.0~Xena's actors in Spider-Man!! Eleanore Sign in Permalink Spider-Man was an "extraodinaire" movie, even if you have never watch or read anything about Spider-Man. The story is easy to understand. A movie which fills everyone with wonder! Have you noticed some links between few actors you played in Spider-Man? First, if I'm right, Lucy lawless was a Woman in the street, then, the Ring Announcer seemed to be Autolycus, and finally, I recognized Ted Raimi. The link is simply Sam Raimi, the executive producer of Xena, Warrior Princess. Then, it's obvious that Lucy Lawless, Bruce Campbell and Ted Raimi were in the movie!
10.0~WOAH DUDE!! TheMightyX Sign in Permalink Hi all, I JUST got back from Spiderman, and OMG it's fabulous!! Apart from one slight error (I hope IMDb posts this as a goof), it was awesome. The only error I could REALLY point out is that in one scene, near the start when he's fighting crime, a spider spun its orb web on a light post. I'm a spider afficionado and I'd like to point out this is NOT an orb weaving spider. And I love the fact that they got all the anatomical details right!! Effin' awesome!!
7.0~Finally out on the screen! KillerLord Sign in Permalink When you are equipped with a resource one of the things that you need to watch out for is the proper and controlled use of the resource. Spider-man had this resource called "computer graphics" on its side. And this was over used. Sometimes the animations appear a little cartoonish. Sometimes, it becomes a little too obvious that the character is too stationery and the background is moving way too fast. May be some of us would like it that way, blurry graphics are being liked too but they are not ideal at least. The story of the origin of powers of Spider-man is done pretty well. They slightly deviated from the original concept of the comics but the deviation was positive. But Peter Parker was a bit too over-painted with colors of sympathy. Sam Raimi is known for his skills to make his audience involve in the movie and the one trick he does seem to use here is that he actually makes the audience sympathize with the character. That has of course added to the success of the film but takes away a little bit of the heroism out. Peter Parker hardly looks strong and determined and looks a little bit too sad. I would find it cool to be Spider-man but definitely not Peter Parker. And Mary Jane's character cannot be liked. I am sure that the masses do not agree but Mary Jane is shown to be a little cruel and self-centered raising a question as to what is it about her that drives Peter mad. More than anything, it convinces me to control myself before "falling" for anyone. The Goblin character seriously looks like he was taken out of one of those 3-d animation movies. There is very little in this character that looks like it is in flesh and blood in a world we can identify with. This is the cartoonish effect I was talking about. The Green Goblin looks cartoonish. Perhaps modification of his suit and especially his helmet might have brought a bit more realism. And yes, slow down the camera. Bring in a few close ups. Speed is not everything! Overall, the movie is filled with fun and can be enjoyed a lot. But it does suffer from over-use or rather improper use of computer-graphics. A very decent adaptation of the comic book but there was a lot of room for development.
8.0~"You're not Superman, you know". classicsoncall Sign in Permalink My summary line above came from Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), spoken from her hospital bed to nephew Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) at her side. It was a great line and a cleverly playful shot at DC Comics, who haven't had as much success in adapting their super-heroes to the big screen the way Marvel Comics has. Back in 2002, this one was the 'make or break' film that would propel Marvel into future projects if it was successful, and history bears out the results. I saw the picture when it came out, but wasn't writing these reviews back then, so I'm a little late to the party. But I have to say, watching it again some nine years later leaves me with some of the same feelings I had back then. I thought the condensed story of Spider-Man's origin was neatly done, along with the way Peter gradually learned to use his new found powers. By the time Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) has his heart to heart talk with Peter and advises - "Just be careful who you change into" - we're already in on Peter's amazing secret with a sense that big things are ahead for the teen-age hero. One of the great kicks I get out of watching the Marvel franchise films is waiting to catch comic book writer and legend Stan Lee in one of his now ubiquitous appearances. Lee is seen in this one during the Green Goblin's attack on the Unity Day Festival when he pulls a young girl away from some falling debris. I was surprised today to see how quick that scene played out, so if you're not attentive you're bound to miss it. I see that Lee's appearance in the picture is uncredited as the 'Man in Fair', but a better clue to help pick him out would be 'Man who saves girl', but as I say, it was a pretty quick scene. The other great memory I had while watching the picture again today was the appearance of Randy 'Macho Man' Savage portraying the wrestler Bone Saw McGraw. Savage, who along with Ric Flair, was one of those pro wrestling villains that had a way of attracting a fan base because of his cool style. He displays his classic finishing move, the flying elbow drop off the top ropes on a hapless opponent before Peter enters the ring as the Human Spider. I was saddened to learn of his untimely and tragic death earlier this year, as he was a colorful character in his own right, and seemed to finally have found some measure of peace in his hectic life. Aside from the reminiscences, the picture itself is a nice balance of character development for the principal players, and action scenes involving Spider-Man and his chief nemesis, Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). I have to admit, the Goblin get-up seemed cheesy to me, looking like a static green robot, especially when the eye-guards were in place. But hey, it's over and done with, so no sense quibbling now. So overall, I thought this was a pretty good and entertaining kick start to the Marvel Universe in cinema, and certainly for your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Subsequent pictures would reinforce the idea that with great power comes great responsibility, a line that has come to epitomize the super-hero genre.
6.0~basically a very nice remake by Raimi of his film Darkman deadmanjones Sign in Permalink I don't want to sound like a movie geek (heaven forbid), but this is basically a very nice remake by Raimi of his film Darkman. The script is uninspiringly blunt at times, particularly in the preamble, and there's honestly not a lot of action when all's said and done (like X-Men, it feels like a promo for a series). There's quite a bit of post Sept 11th New Yorker flag waving too (nothing wrong with that). On the other hand Kirsten Dunst looks FANTASTIC, and all three main leads have always been brilliant actors (and the Bruce Campbell cameo is hilarious). Entertaining; it would be churlish not to enjoy this stylish comic book hokum.
10.0~I LOVE this movie!! kattyagi Sign in Permalink Hey People! I have been waiting to see Spider-man since November 2001! I was so excited to see it the weekend it came out! I was NOT disappointed, as some other people might say, I think it is the best action/adventure/thriller movie I have ever seen! (my next favorite movie would be X-men!) Spider-man was terrific, and im going to see it again and again. I rate it a 10, because it was more than what i expected! I LUV how he swings thru the air and jumps all over the place, those moves were awesome! I know the ending kinda sux, he dosen't really get together with MJ, but oh-well that is the story- that's how it goes! Those critics reviews that said that this movie is "unrealistic...blah blah" have no imagination- guys its a COMIC BOOK character!! he's a hero! I can't wait 'till the next one(s) come out! (lol) Tobey Maguire was the perfect spiderman! and everyone i know was doubting him, but he turned out to be the best one yet!
9.0~The AMAZING Spider-Man! kenobi7 Sign in Permalink Recently, superhero films have been an extremely effective genre in Hollywood. It is undeniable that superhero films are the movies that endure the most hype these days. If made correctly, these kind of movies offer plenty of action, thrills, and character, while also being impressively designed and using some of the best special effects teams around. Bryan Singer's "X-MEN" was the movie that introduced the superhero film to the 21st century. It raised the bar so high, the audiences were astounded and it seemed like no other movie, superhero or otherwise, could surpass it. That bar has definitely been raised to new levels many times since then with films such as the spectacular "THE DARK KNIGHT" and, to a lesser extent, "IRON MAN". However, "SPIDER-MAN" is nothing to sneeze at either. High school nerd Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) lives with his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson). His next door neighbor happens to be the beautiful Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), whom Peter has loved since "before he even liked girls". Peter is also best friends with Harry Osborn (James Franco), whose dad is Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe). Norman is overly ambitious with his company, Oscorp (which supplies weapons and special equipment to the military), and wants to give Harry everything that he never had in his younger days. One life-changing day, Peter's class goes on a field trip to Columbia University's Science Department. During the tour, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically enhanced "super-spider" that escaped from an exhibit. That night, Norman is testing one of his company's performance enhancers on himself. The experiment goes horribly wrong, and Norman becomes the incredibly strong yet viciously insane Green Goblin. Meanwhile, Peter has undergone a night of dizziness and a stomach ache due to the spider bite. In the morning, he finds that he also has gained heightened strength, agility, can spin webs from his wrists, climb walls, and a certain "spider-sense" to warn him of danger. Mary Jane and Peter become much closer friends, despite the fact that she is now dating Harry. She also thinks she loves Spider-Man after he saves her life twice. Goblin is suspicious of Spider-Man's true identity. He also feels threatened by Parker, but has not yet made the connection between the two. They finally square off in a fantastic showdown that is also one of the best scenes in the entire movie. But, at the end of the day, "SPIDER-MAN" still has its faults. For example, what is Goblin's plan? We understand his revenge against the Quest Aerospace officials and the Oscorp board members, but what else is there? He has a personal vendetta against Spider-Man, but why? Just to write it off as him being insane is not sufficient. Up next is the cinematography during the scenes of Spider-Man swinging through the city. They play and look like a video game, with the camera seeming to be too distant and too close at the same time. The feeling of all the tension, fear, and confusion of his new powers is actually not felt at all; he acts more like a kid in a candy shop. Instead of keeping the camera a reasonable distance from him so we can see how he uses his surroundings to display his amazing powers, the camera is tight on him, right over his shoulder most of the time. Strangely, the cinematography for the action scenes is quite good. The only scene of this kind that works in this film is the ending, which was filmed with the Spyder-Cam. It was a very effective technique that was used for all the swinging and fighting scenes in "SPIDER-MAN 2", and I would assume it was used in #3 as well, but I haven't seen that one yet. As a matter of fact, everything in #2 is improved over #1. The acting, action pieces, dialogue, and especially the villain. Nevertheless, everything in this film still comes together reasonably well, with only a few drawbacks. Also Recommended: "SUPERMAN" (1978), "X-MEN" (2000), "X2" (2003), "SPIDER-MAN 2" (2004), "BATMAN BEGINS" (2005) THIS REVIEW IS DEDICATED TO ANYONE, LIVING OR DEAD, INVOLVED WITH THE MAKING OF "SPIDER-MAN".
1.0~Absolute Dross rmoreton Sign in Permalink What a load of dreadful pap. I agree wholeheartedly with user's TJ-91 comments below and could not have put it better myself. Whilst diversity of opinion is what makes life interesting I cannot help but feel that all the adoring fans of this movie must either be on the Spiderman payroll or watching a completely different film! Anyway there is hope for all or us if something so bad can make so much money!
10.0~One of the best movies ever made oldsbrav Sign in Permalink The amount of work to get the special effects to look as perfect as they do is mind boggling. The love story between Peter Parker and Mary Jane is done very well and to top off all this the acting is superb. It is my opinion that this movie is one of the top ten movies of 2002 and for me one of the top 10 ever made. It has universal appeal with the action and love story, without being to heavily in either area. Everyone can relate to this movie to some degree.
4.0~Nothing but effects. MovieGuy109 Sign in Permalink Spiderman is a corny adaptation of the Marvel comic book with even cornier effects to showcase it. Maguire is surprisingly dull in the lead part and none of the other actors are there to help him out. it all plays out like a badly-written video game. I have never cared about films with lots of special effects and little story, but Spiderman confirms my dislike because of corny and overused special effects and no story that has never been told better before. Raimi is not going for anything having to do with characters, he is simply showcasing a large amount of effects on yet another digital backdrop. Simmons does add some great comic relief to the story however and Dafoe is not bad as the lead villain, but that is about it here.
9.0~About Frickin' Time!! big_turk_jr Sign in Permalink The wait is finally over... I was and am a fan of Spiderman ever since I was a kid. I thought I would be disappointed from the movie, after all the hype and wait. But that was not the case. I loved this movie from beginning to end. There could not have been a better job on casting the parts. It was like the actors were made for the roles. J.K. Simmons was hilarious. One thing was some of the shots with Spiderman doing stunts, were a bit flaky I found, but still amazing to watch. So what else can I say but go see it and I am going again.
8.0~Pretty well done. srwatcher Sign in Permalink As a kid I've always enjoyed spider man. I feel the first movie was a great adaptation of the comics. Sure a few things were changed but overall it was still pleasant to see. This was one of the first well done superhero movies I've seen. Enough time was spent on character development to have things smooth out efficiently. Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker was a great choice. Despite his age he still easily passes off as a teenager. Also William Dafoe was great as the Goblin. It took time to get used to MJ. Kirsten Dunst with red hair at first seemed awkward to me. I eventually got used to it. I was too used to the cartoon MJ. Overall, it's definitely something I recommend watching, even buying.
9.0~Probably the best superhero film so far jommy Sign in Permalink You know the great feeling when you leave the movie theater after seeing certain films? Well, I had it after seeing Spiderman. Might be that I have been a Spiderman fan above other superheroes all my life, but still, I think this film has captured the original cartoon's feeling and atmosphere. You could feel yourself jumping above New York along Spiderman. Also I think J.K. Simmons made a marvelous role as J.J. Jameson, he captured the original cartoon character's nature so well, that I was all smile when he was showed on screen. And for other roles too, casting was a 10+. In short: A must see if you ever liked Spiderman comics, and even if you haven't read any, still a great movie to see!
3.0~The preview was better galensaysyes Sign in Permalink ...and so were the book, the strip, the TV series, and the Saturday morning cartoon. The film must have cost a big fat bundle, but it feels like TV, and everything in it has been done better on TV, as well as in other movies. What was effective in the preview--the one-liners, Kirsten Dunst's delight at being rescued, the exhilaration of the web swinging--falls flat in context because it is inadequately prepared for and because whoever made the preview didn't make the movie. For instance, when Peter is testing out his powers, the big swing across town comes too soon and too easy. Here, and in the other dramatic progressions, big and necessary steps are missing. The actors are miscast, as compared to the comic book or to the script. In addition, they are ill-matched, except for Willem Dafoe and the Ethan Hawke clone playing his son. Dunst doesn't seem like Maguire's lifelong neighbor or his girlfriend (too old, too self-centered, from a different world), Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris don't seem like his uncle and aunt, or like husband and wife, and so on. It would be difficult, I think, to match Tobey Maguire with any actor. Even so, he and Dafoe do very entertaining work, given that they're doing solos and they perforce miss certain notes outside their ranges. But between them they carry the movie. My biggest disappointment was in the lack of the surge I had hoped for from Spider Man's flights through the city. I only felt it in the last scene (which I'm pretty sure was given away in the preview); in most of the others the movements are too fast or too dark to be clearly made out, and when they can be, the super-characters often look like computer cartoons, which indeed they are. I suppose the reason their masks are stiff and inexpressive is to enable the actors to be matched more easily with the cartoons, but it weakens the dramatic scenes; we might as well be watching the cartoons. The heavies--Dafoe in his Green Goblin activities (which owe a lot to the Wicked Witch of the West) and Jonah Jameson--are too silly and irritating to be taken seriously. Most of all, the numerous rescues convey no sense of danger or relief, no joy in deliverance or gratitude for the coming of a deliverer, no reason to cheer the hero. Maybe "2" will be better.
8.0~Spider-Man has arrived with a big splash The Movie Buff Sign in Permalink Spiderman is a well made, ahead of its time, comic book action flick. Some of the footage in this movie is the most exhilarating I have ever experienced. When he jumps from building to building in NyC, you feel like you are along with him for the ride. When I first heard that Tobey McGuire was playing Spiderman, I thought it was a huge mistake, that he wasn't fit for the part. However, Tobey proved me wrong. Though he wasn't sensational and carried the movie, he was good enough, which is all you have to be when the title of the movie is Spiderman. People don't go see it for the acting. The dialogue was ok, with a couple of very corny, predicable, lines that you can see coming from a mile away. One was when Spiderman just got finished wrestling for money, but the owner shortchanged him. Tobey told the owner that he needed the money, and the owner replied `Explain to me how that's my problem' or something like that. Then, shortly after, the owner gets robbed; Spiderman just let the robber go right past him. Then the owner confronted Tobey telling him that the robber just took all his money, which Tobey replied `Explain to me how that's my problem.' The ending dialogue was also kind of corny, with Dunst spilling her heart. The acting was decent, despite the presence of Dunst. Willem Dafoe was very good as the green goblin. The best scene of the whole movie was when Spiderman faced Goblin in Times Square. For some reason, they spent too much time showing straight up fight scenes between the two. It would have been better to show more chasing scenes, rather than just seeing the two in a boxing match. The movie also developed the story at a good pace, not moving too fast or too slow. I would rate Spiderman as the best comic book adaptation since superman. It might even be a better action flick than superman. After the boring dialogue at the end, the movie finishes with a very strong ending, Spiderman jumping through the city, ending up on top of the empire state building. I gave Spiderman an 8/10.
10.0~Great rendition of one of my fave heroes seltzer Sign in Permalink The effects are amazing, mostly because they look so real and blend in seamlessly with the real world. You really do get the sense that this is happening in the real New York City, not some half-hearted rip-off of it. The story is right out of the comic books, but plays well. The cast were excellent. Tobey Maguire nails the part of Peter Parker, Willem Dafoe brings great depth and a little sympathy to the confused Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, and Kirsten Dunst brings Mary Jane to life much better than I thought she would. Some of the supporting players are also great, especially J.K. Simmons' J. Jonah Jameson. Perfect casting. They waste no time getting right into the story, and the origin sequence is as good as any you'll find in a comic book. The only changes made to the various minutiae of the comic world are for the better or hardly noticeable. Sam Raimi is not only a huge Spider-man fan, but a smart one as well. This is clearly a labor of love for him, and he makes it look cool, too. If he directs the sequels, I can't wait for more! This ranks up there as the best superhero movie yet. Nuff said.
10.0~This is the a Kickass Blockbuster of the Summer!!! Joker420_6977 Sign in Permalink Spider-man is an awesome movie to kick-off the summer. Sam Raimi did the best directing job of his whole career. Tobey Maguire did an execllent job on Spider-man. I couldn't believe all of the special effects that was in the movie. I thought the special effects would look cheesy because it was done on computer but it was an very good movies. I thought that steve Ditko and Stan Lee did an outstanding job on the script. I loved William Dafoe who played the Green Goblin ( which he played in Platoon with Charlie Sheen) it did him good to be back on the big screen. Kirsten Dunst who played Mary Jane Watson did better than i thought she would in that role. don't forget James Franco who played Harry Osborn in the movie he did such a good job you should go see Deuces wild which open on the same day. BUT please go see the Spider-man take the family out or your boyfriend/ girlfriend it's a movie you would enjoy no matter your age is go have fun and see it See the MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!
8.0~A lot of fun easmith03 Sign in Permalink A great adaptation of a comic book for the big screen. The movie gives you a feel for Peter Parker's awkwardness as a teen, and the transformation he makes to become Spiderman. The love story between Parker/Spiderman and M.J. will remind you of the relationship between Superman and Lois Lane. Where you the viewer are in on the secret, and kind of hoping that M.J can figure it out. The special effects were mostly great. But, some of the scenes of Spiderman flying through the streets on his web looked a little fake. But, did remind me a great deal of the animation from the comic books. I think fans of comic book style action adventure will find the movie to be a lot fun. I thought all of the acting performances were great. Particularly, Defoe was memorable in a difficult role of the nice guy/ruthless business man, transforming into the arch villain.
10.0~Sam Raimi did a great job dzk70 Sign in Permalink I was worried when the torch was passed to Sam Raimi to direct this film. His take on he whole comic book themes and transitions was a great way to get the audience into the film. Toby Mcguire was an astounding Peter Parker. His looks and mannerism were just comical. I'm not a big fan of cg in films of this caliber but I got passed it because Spider-man is a different kind of super hero. His is fast, agile, and always on the move when he's swinging from building to building. Kirstin Dunst is a great Mary Jane and the dialouge between her and Peter Parker/Spider-man is pretty good. The Green Goblin was a good villian, it was like watching the first Batman with the Joker (the only good Batman) when he and Spider-man got together. The film was cursed to stay in the dark for years because of legal problems. I was really hoping to see James Cameron's vision on the film since he is a great writer and director; which is why i had my reservations when Sam Raimi got the go ahead to make the movie. All in all a great way to introduce the many great films this summer. Also, congrats to all who made Spider-Man for getting in the box office record books, hopefully some flick will beat that cursed film "Titanic".
10.0~Greatest Super Hero Movie Ever eti55 Sign in Permalink Spiderman took me back to when I was 11, when I read the Spidey comics. More than any other comic-based movie, this is the comic book come to life, and it's better than any super hero movie I've seen before or since. I know, I know, a lot of Dark Knight enthusiasts will poo-poo this assessment. Fine (I'd rank The Dark Knight at #2). The thing is, I like movies that balance the serious stuff with a sense of humor (the Spidey comics did this), which is where the Dark Knight franchise falls short. For example, the man-on-the-street stuff leading up to Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson's initial rant had me absolutely rolling. The ill-tempered and insufferable Jameson was done to a T by J K Simmons ("We can get a picture of Julia Roberts in a thong, we can certainly get a picture of THIS weirdo!"). He actually did the comic book character one better; his performance definitely was the straw that stirred the drink mid-film. This is a good thing, as Spidey isn't quite the wise-ass in the movie that he is in the comic (my only complaint, and it's minor). That said, Tobey McGuire does a fine job of balancing Peter Parker, the nerdy science whiz kid, with his genetically-mutated Spiderman alter-ego, creating a bona-fide hero that the audience can root for. It seems every super hero has something that drives them to be a crusader for justice, and in Parker's case it was the guilt over failing to use his new spider powers to stop a thief who would go on to murder his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson in one of his many reliably good performances), who was also his only real father figure. As Parker's love interest Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst is sweet and likable, with just the right amount of sex appeal tossed in. James Franco is good as Parker's spoiled best buddy Harry Osbourne. This leads us to..wait for it..Willem Dafoe, whose portrayal of Harry's father Norman, the arrogant scientist and CEO of Oscorp who puts his own personal ambition ahead of safety for himself and his test subjects, leading to his transformation (via ingesting/inhaling an experimental "performance enhancing" drug) into the thoroughly evil, wildly insane and megalomaniacal Green Goblin, is frighteningly convincing, so much so that you can easily look past the cheesy exo- skeleton outfit he wears. Again, I felt like I was seeing the comic book come to life. As for the effects/action sequences, I know, they've been panned by some (notably Roger Ebert), but they looked good to me. I actually liked the fact that they weren't overdone. Ebert in particular criticized the CGI in this movie, but to me, ALL CGI looks phony and cartoonish. I thought the effects looked just fine as CGI goes, and the action sequences were first rate. One scene in particular where Spiderman is hanging by his web while holding onto a train car full of kids, and at the same time trying to save Mary Jane, is exceptionally gripping. It all leads up to a nice payoff at the end, with the final confrontation between Spidey and the Goblin. The fact that this movie came out within a week of the disappointing Attack of the Clones served as a reminder to this former fan of the Star Wars franchise exactly why I like these kinds of movies. It's not about the special effects; it's the people and the story (pity George Lucas forgot about that. Unfortunately so had Sam Raimi by the time he made Spidey 3). What makes Spiderman such a great movie comes down to a good story (lifted from the comic but adjusted to fit the times), along with fun, likable characters you can root for, compelling villains to root against, and good peripheral characters to stir things up (aside from Simmons, Bruce Campbell makes the most of his screen time as a wrestling ring announcer (Ann: what's your name kid? Parker: The Human Spider. Ann: The Human Spider, that's it? That's the best you've got? Parker: Yeah. Ann: Aaaahh, that sucks!) See this again, and don't bother with the reboot.
3.0~Extremely Disappointing!!!! bullseye007_2002 Sign in Permalink The greatest(arguably) comic hero of all time was desecrated by this pathetic attempt at a film. Everything surrounding Spider-Man's character ---- viz his relationship with the Osbournes, Mary Jane etc was given way too much importance and time. The fact that this was supposed to be an action movie, not a glossed up love story eluded Director Sam Raimi.The introduction to Spider-Man, who he was,how he came into existence, who he cared for, admired etc should have been done and over with in 20-25 minutes , with the rest being devoted to something more sinister than a love-struck guy saving and re-saving his love from the clutches of a maniac. The action scenes, specially the parts where he experiments with his new found powers were mostly "Matrix" rip-offs. The fight scenes were like taken directly out of a Jet Li film. This movie had no style whatsoever. I cant understand how you can take one of the coolest characters of all time and churn out a totally run of the mill movie like this one. The only impressive thing about the movie was Tobey MaGuire...who was pitch perfect. Kirsten Dunst was cute as hell. William Dafoe when out of the stupid/cheap green suit was fine. And about that Green Goblin Mask.....when are directors going to realize that not everything translates well from the Comic Pages to the screen. It was a fixed Mask....!!!!! You look stupid when you have more than a half dozen closeups of a bad guy with a fixed Mask.....It worked for Star Wars but that was the late seventies/early eighties....and now it just looks cheap. Perhaps the only cool action shot was the one where Spider-Man lands on a flagpole, but it came only as an after-thought right at the end. And what can I say about the ending....corny as hell. There was not an ounce of sophistication in this movie. I, for one, have no idea where they spent the $125+ Million on. They should have taken a clue from X-Men who inspite of working within a budget just over half of this film provided excellent entertainment without overdoing either the character development/introduction or the action/story. I like Bryan Singer's X-men more than I liked it before I saw this. I feel cheated...disappointed. Damn it...!!! .
10.0~Spider-Man is an exciting webslinging cliffhanger. Spideroach Sign in Permalink I have seen many movies based on comic books and this is the best one by far. The advancement of computers in movies really helped in the special effects. I might just watch this one again. At first I didn't think that Tobey McGuire would be the best spiderman but he proved me wrong. I am also happy that there is going to be a part II. I am going to see that one too.
9.0~Number II Will Be Better jwinters-2 Sign in Permalink Very good, but not a classic yet. But the next one will be if they keep the same quality and same characters. A lot was wasted on getting us non spider fans up to speed on the whole story line. Second half was really good and loved the specials. Definitely worth a watch on the big screen.
7.0~An Open Letter to Sam Raimi Quicksand Sign in Permalink Dear Mr. Raimi, You hack. You won me over with the Evil Dead films, showed true promise with "For Love of the Game," and showed a true director's gift with "A Simple Plan." What the hell happened? Mostly, I suppose we can blame the script. David Koepp has never had a fond place in my heart, and yes, while he did write the very good "Panic Room," the script itself was just okay, it was the director that made that movie. Ditto for "Jurassic Park," and anyone who says differently needs to go back and watch that flick again. For the second Jurassic Park alone, Mr. Koepp should be run out of town on a rail. Was it the studio pressure? I can sure see how it got to Mr. Burton on that ridiculous "Planet of the Apes" remake. Notice, now that the film is all done, and surely making the studio lots of money (all they really care about anyway, so anything said after Opening Day is incidental, right? WRONG!)... notice how you wimped out, and screwed up a wonderful opportunity: Peter Parker gets cool spider powers. Neat-o. His skin allows him to cling to walls, tiny little hairs that let him stick to metal, paper, brick, what have you. Ahhhh, yes, but then, now he's wearing a suit. With gloves. How can he still do this? Ohhh, wait a minute, is the argument. You're nitpicking, Mr. Internet Guy, OBVIOUSLY it's very thin material. Well, yes, I get that. I'm not stupid. Why, then, did you feel the need to not explain that, but then show the flashback of the mugger running past Peter Parker? Did we forget? That scene happened TWO MINUTES BEFORE. Wow, Mr. Raimi, seriously. Either respect your audience's intelligence, or don't, but riding the fence in such an wimp-out way is only going to get you in trouble. See also, again, "Planet of the Apes" remake. Lots of nice moments. Cinematographer Don Burgess still lacks the visual "wow" that will ever make him great, so people must hire him because he's cheap; whatever. Everyone ELSE knew what they were doing here, except Willem Dafoe, who should really go back to drama. But I can't blame you for casting him; after all, look at what he did for "Speed 2." A valiant effort, Mr. Raimi, and I hope these notes will help you when it comes time to put the sequel together. Special effects are there to HELP the story, not BE the story. I'm all happy that Peter Parker is enjoying jumping from buildings, but don't you ever EVER replace a character with a CGI effect. It didn't work in Harry Potter, it didn't work in Blade 2, it sure didn't work for JarJar, and so it doesn't work here. If I were a movie executive, I would so fire you. However, being literate, I am too intelligent to be a movie executive. You, Mr. Raimi, used to be smart, I suggest you call up your old buddies the Coens and have a long talk before you make any more rash decisions, like script choices, opening credits (I may care about the names of the cast, but 95% of America does not), or that horrible, awful, direct-to-bargain-bin soundtrack (not the score, mind you; but promise me to never hire Aerosmith or flavor-of-the-month Nickelback again, I don't care how many records they sell). I liked it, but seriously. Superman II outshone the original, heres hoping you can learn from your mistakes. Warmest Personal Regards, 7/10. p.s. Extra cool points for the Lucy Lawless cameo. See, you CAN be creative when you want to be!!
10.0~Superman pulls a nail-biter tae_mah_shoe Sign in Permalink Spidey fans be prepared for your next visual excitement. This is no Casablanca, no shawshank redemption, no lord of the rings... im sure it's 'nuff said. My eyes were startled courtesy of an Advanced screener.
9.0~Meets High Expectations Karlover Sign in Permalink Rarely does a film get so much publicity, so much hype, and you walk out of it actually surprised by how good it was. Let me tell you, Spiderman might be one of the few blockbusters that is actually a blockbuster. Spiderman is a classic story and for once in a great while, the film version did the classic story justice. There were two things I said when I left this film: "The worst thing about this movie is that I am just a regular guy with no superpowers." and "The best thing about this movie is that I am 20 years old and can still enjoy it like I am 7." Some might complain that there is some cheesy dialogue, and there is, but you have to remember that this is a comic book on screen, and the dialogue is exactly how it is in a comic book. I think the most pleasant surprise is just how much Tobey Maguire convinced me that he was Spiderman. I know he was a good actor, but I thought he was too dweeby to be an action star. Well he works wonders as this part and deserves all the fame this film will yield for him. Willem Dafoe...simply outstanding. If you're not into fun, fantasy, adventure, don't see Spiderman. If you are a person who complains at every visible CGI animation, don't see Spiderman. If you want to be taken into a dreamlike, fantasy, adventurous world of superheroes, where you will be swept up and surrounded by all of its excitement and passion, then please, for your own sake, SEE SPIDERMAN!! 9 out of 10.
6.0~This Early Superhero Smash, Which Helped Jump-Start the Modern Craze, is Showing its Age drqshadow-reviews Sign in Permalink The webslinger's first foray onto the big screen, and in many ways the grandfather of the big Marvel juggernaut that's been chewing up the box office for the last decade. Sam Raimi's vision of Spidey and his pals is true to the essence of the character, with a vibe that's often reminiscent of his '60s debut, while still feeling modern and serious when needed. It boasts an extremely effective cast, despite selecting a few actors I don't usually enjoy. Tobey Maguire makes an appropriately awkward, plucky Peter Parker. Kirsten Dunst is sweet and charming as his lifelong next-door crush. James Franco shows range as the troubled best friend. J.K. Simmons was positively born for his bit role as the hot-headed J. Jonah Jameson. And, of course, Willem Dafoe brings a fantastically expressive act in the villainous role of Norman Osborn, the Green Goblin (though he's often, sadly, relegated to mere voice work behind a stiff, metal mask). It has spirit and humor and character, but it also has a habit of over-reaching and a wince-worth tendency for ridiculously awful dialog. Even in print, it can be tough to keep this character from sounding corny and stilted, and in live action that's doubly difficult. The script constantly trips and stumbles over itself, trying and failing to seem cute and off-the-cuff, and Raimi's direction (itself known to lean on the cheesy side) always has the actors winking at the camera while their puns are falling flat. The plot is solid, planting handfuls of seeds for future storylines while effectively setting up the current conflict, though it does have a nasty habit of over-indulgence. A double backflip during a schoolyard fistfight, for example, when the leap alone would've been enough. That kind of exaggeration is all over the place, and not only isn't it necessary, it actively ruins the immersion. I remembered really enjoying this upon its release, and it's still entertaining viewing, but much of it hasn't aged well, particularly in light of its modern counterparts.
10.0~Incredible doesn't begin to describe this action/comic movie DJKorban Sign in Permalink I was a bit skeptical about this movie at first. I've seen quite a few attempts to bring comic book heros to the big screen only to become sub par attempts at what might have been a great movie. Technology might have had a part in that. Computers weren't very widely used until 1994, a year after Jurassic Park showed the true capabilities of 3D Animation. But it wasn't the effects that made movies like Mystery Men and Batman & Robin come up short. It was terrible writing. A lack-luster storyline. Without that, the movie goes nowhere. Granted, Batman and Batman Returns were good movies, but they still lacked and weren't very true to the comic. Spider-man, thankfully, was made by a man that had actually read the comic when he was younger. That could be why it's such a great movie. The effects where incredible and really did "wow" me every so often. There were a few shots where you could tell it was a CG Spider-man, but they filmed it in such a way that it went by very quickly and very smooth. I was highly impressed with the swinging. The life-like animations were flawless and definitely exciting. As for the story, I'll be the first to admit, I got a bit misty eyed when Uncle Ben died. The acting surpassed every expectation I had. Tobey showed that he was MADE to be Peter Parker and William Dafoe played his part EXTREMELY well. The story stayed true to the comic book and really had me on the edge of my seat all the way through. Even the ending was very good. Some say it was a bit lacking, but I really enjoyed it. It made me proud to be a New Yorker, and when you see it, you'll know why I say that. I highly recommend running out and seeing this movie. It really is the best action movie so far this year.
10.0~Sam Raimi proves himself worthy of Spider-Man! I_Love_Spielberg Sign in Permalink I had never heard of Sam Raimi when I saw "Spider-Man," but I was not disappointed. This film amazed me. After learning about the other movies Sam Raimi has directed, I was shocked to see him take on something like this. His movies in the past consist of "The Evil Dead" trilogy, "Darkman," "For Love of the Game," and "The Quick and the Dead." Quite the resume for someone like him. Anyway, the action in this movie is fantastic, the acting is dead on, the drama is there, and you really can't expect more out of anything else. I especially love the scene where Tobey Maguire is trying to shoot webbing out of his hand but can't do it because he's doing the wrong hand gestures. It was funny! Kudos to Sam Raimi and everyone who was involved in "Spider-Man."
10.0~Fantastic! Spectacular! FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!! superboy478 Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is absolutley one of the greatest comic book adaptations of all time. When I went to see it, I had this feeling that it was going to be campy and boring. I also thought that the movie would turn out like a parody of all super-heroes. Instead, I received 2 hours 25 minutes of nothing but solid fun from begining to end. A high school science nerd named Peter (Tobey Maguire) has discovered a new species of spider during a class field trip one day. In fact, he is fiercely bitten by the new form of spider. Meanwhile, a tycoon scientist named Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe) is working on a transportation system for the city and may fail with his company if the test results indeed do so. Peter ends up saving his longtime crush, the sexy Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), from falling down in the cafeteria. What he discovers is that he can shoot a web from his wrist and dodge punches and bullying by his classmates. Norman Osborne then performs a test which turns out wrong and deadly because he is accidently mutated into the Green Goblin, a creature that wants nothing but evil. Peter then discovers his own new ablities and turns himself into the famous Spider-Man, a crimefighter who stops the big busts and dealers of New York and now is assigned to destroy the Green Goblin before it is too late. Spider-Man, I would have to say, is the best comic book movie produced incredibley ever since 1977 when Alexander and Ilya Salkind produced Superman. Produced by Laura Ziskin and Ian Bryce, and directed by Sam Raimi (A Simple Plan, Army of Darkness), Spider-Man will blow you away completley. It will also out do Star Wars: Episode II The Phantom Menace this summer! Coming Soon: SPIDER-MAN 2
8.0~A movie for the masses... holaprofesoravlc Sign in Permalink I highly recommend the movie Spider-Man (2002); it's very special. This is a movie that everybody can watch. It has a lot of action and explosive special effects, but it also has romance and emotion. There are relationships such as family, friendships, and romantic partners. These range from sweet and protective, to complicated, to just plain sad. All audiences will find it interesting. Most of all, the whole family will enjoy watching Spider-Man together. Kids will love his powers, his moves, and his Spidey-suit. Parents will love the moral: good over bad; their kids learn to use power or influence to be positive in life. Additionally, we can share something from our generation with the new ones. We also recommend this movie to fans of the comics. The movie is true to the books. It's surprising how wonderful it is to see figures from your imagination come to life! Grab your favorite friends and family, put on your best Spidey-suit, and bring the popcorn!
10.0~A sure box office hit! Imerald Sign in Permalink I was lucky enough to go to the sneek preview and I must say, I am quite impressed with his movie! Although it is not like the comic, it surely makes up for it. The CGI effects are absolutely stunning and Tobey McGuire playes a wonderful Peter Parker. Willem DeFoe makes an excellent Green Goblin and his maniacal laughing will have you shifting in your seat. The movie is mostly action, but there are a couple of scenes that are tearjerkers. I recommend this movie for all ages!! It's a wonderful movie that will definitely hit the box office hard and could hurt George Lucas' Episode II.
10.0~Spider-Man, Spider-Man, does whatever a Spider can, spins a web, any size, catches thieves, just like flies look out! there goes the Spider-Man Professor Chaos Sign in Permalink I had obtained an advance screening pass for this movie two days before it was to be released. The theatre was packed with kids, comicbook geeks, and so forth. I did not know what to expect, but having watched many of Sam Raimi's other films, and having recently seen the Cider House Rules also starring Tobey Maguire, and just loving the idea of Kirsten Dunst with red hair, I was highly optimistic. And righteously so. The movie was great fun. It extrapolates a lot based on Spider-Man's origin tale, and tells it in a fun humorous way. Very bright and fun for a comicbook movie.. Very rare these days when every comicbook based movie aims for a darker .. batman/dark city look. But thats just not spidey. There were some parts of the movie that were ... lacking.. The opening credits were way too long (WE WANT SPIDER-MAN ALREADY) .. not that the Danny Elfman score wasnt great. They always are. But you can only watch neat-o graphics of peoples names for so long. But truly, I don't think that anywone else could have done a better job.. It was the perfect cast, the perfect team to do this movie. I have to say Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin was also great. I still don't like the helmet mask thing, but I can't complain. A minor quibble. All in all, a great movie that I certainly plan to get on DVD the moment its out.
7.0~Good Comic Book/Superhero Film! gwnightscream Sign in Permalink Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Willem Dafoe, Rosemary Harris, Cliff Robertson and J.K. Simmons star in Sam Raimi's 2002 action film based on the Marvel comics. Maguire plays nerdy teen, Peter Parker who lives with his Aunt May (Harris) and Uncle Ben (Robertson). He also has a best friend, Harry Osborn (Franco) whose father, Norman (Dafoe) is a wealthy scientist. Dunst (Interview with the Vampire) plays Peter's crush, Mary Jane Watson who lives next-door to him. Soon, Peter gets bit by a super-genetic spider while on a class trip with Harry and starts to change. Meanwhile, Norman tries to save his failing company by performing an experiment on himself and becomes menace, the Green Goblin. Peter starts feeling different and becomes tough against bullies and wrestlers. Soon, he learns that with great power comes great responsibility and becomes web-slinging hero, Spider-Man. He also gets a job as a photographer at The Daily Bugle owned by J. Jonah Jameson (Simmons). This is a good comic book/superhero film featuring a good cast, neat effects & great score by Danny Elfman as usual. Bruce Campbell (The Evil Dead) also makes a cameo in this and the next 2 films with Raimi's younger brother, Ted and Spider-Man creator, Stan Lee. I recommend this.
8.0~One of the best superhero films ever epatters-3 Sign in Permalink I enjoyed this. If you liked the first Superman film, you will love this. I think that it is better then Superman, but Superman is still good. If you are a fan of the spider-man comic books, then you will like this. I believe that any true fan of the comics would enjoy this film. I have read some Spidey comics and liked them. If you have not seen this, then go to your local video rental store and rent it. If you like it, then buy it. I remember the day I first saw it in the theater. I was 5. I loved it. So did my mom. We bought it on DVD when the DVD came out. I still love it to this day. I have seen all 3 in the movie theater and own all 3 of them on DVD. So my overall rating for Spider-Man 1 is 8 out of 10 spiders. Enjoy. Thank you.
8.0~Spiderman: First Installment of the Original Trilogy iconic-sr Sign in Permalink Brief Overview: Sony has released two different Spider-Man franchises to date, and the movie I am reviewing is the first Spider-Man in the original trilogy (I have also reviewed both movies from the current franchises, so if you find this helpful check out those two reviews under my name iconic-sr). 2002 Spider-Man for the time it was nothing short of spectacular. In many ways, the original Spider-Man is a pioneer for many of the comic book movies we have today. This film is directed by Sam Raimi, and stars Tobey McGuire as Spider-Man, Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin (the antagonist) and Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. The Positives: For the most part, 2002 Spider-Man stays true to the comic books, while making some minor changes that actually work pretty well. I felt that the casting was good, and each actor fit their role (with the possible exception of Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane). The CGI for the movie is impressive for the time this movie was made, and the action sequences are shot very well. Willem Dafoe plays a very good Green Goblin, displaying insanity and a sinister vibe that really makes him a notable villain for comic book movies and proves a challenge for our protagonist. The Negatives: I think most people who have seen this movie would agree that the overall tone is bordering on the cheesy side. I felt like a lot of moments that should have been intense were underplayed and others were overacted. Kirsten Dunst's interpretation of Mary Jane was bland. She portrayed virtually no emotion, and is really the only problem I had with the casting for this film. The Conclusion: I gave this movie an 8/10 because given the time that it was created this movie was the elite super-hero movie. The storyline, action and dialogue keeps the interest of the audience and provides a fun movie for comic book fans. I recommend this for general audiences.
9.0~It's better than you thought it would be... MRyerson2 Sign in Permalink I was kind of skeptical when I went to go see Spider-Man, thinking that Tobey Maguire was definitely not the right person to play the pseudo-arachnid. After seeing the movie I'm still not sure that Maguire was the right actor for the job, but I am sure that this movie was excellent. As the opening credits begin the first thing I thought was "Ohh this has got to be Danny Elfman music.." Sure enough it was. That is step #1 in the director's guide to having a successful action movie: You must have Danny Elfman provide the music (Well, Elfman or Alan Silvestri). The music throughout is excellent. Willem Dafoe is good as the Green Goblin. The movie has very few slow points, but most of them involve sappy love scenes between Maguire and the poorly-casted Kirsten Dunst. There are 3000 other redheads who could have played MJ better. Cliff Robertson plays a surprisingly good role as Peter Parker's uncle, Ben. Overall the movie is enjoyable. It definitely gets you psyched about the sequels. The coolest parts of this movie is the very last scene where Peter Parker asserts: I am Spiderman. =)
8.0~One of the best superhero movies EVER!!! pantelisandreou98 Sign in Permalink To begin spider-man is my favourite hero in marvel universe. I loved spider-man since i was 4 years old and i still love him. When this movie first came out i went like crazy to see my favourite superhero for the first time in the big screen. The effects of the film are breathtaking and the soundtrack is joyful but green goblin in the film is a little disappointment because he is like a robot and not like an elf but he still the same evil and one of the greatest enemies of spider-man. In the movie you'll see the birth of the hero, the wrath and the big lesson that spider-man gets. I know that everyone have seen this film but if you don't this is not just a movie it's a legend. 4/5
1.0~Top of my movie "WORST" list!!! peacepit Sign in Permalink I now use Spiderman as my reference when talking about the worst use of special effects in movie history (too much bombardment of them), worst acting (Tobey Mcguire), worst costume (Green Goblin), worst over hyping of a movie (movie has a heart my eye), worst script ( you thought A beautiful mind was bad after they changed facts about the main character to make it more pc to the public) and to top it off the worst ending i have seen in the cinema (when tobey walks off and gives his speech all you wanted to do was laugh and say MORONIC IDIOT as if this movie isn't bad enough)!!! I am not going to bother getting this piece of trash on DVD. I will however being buying all versions of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on DVD (9 DVD's, theatrical, extended and gift versions) for therein lies true movie brilliance (after one release of the trilogy it is destined for greatness). I won't even bother to waste my time with the sequels to spiderman when they eventually release them, I am not spending another cent on the spiderman C-R-A-P!!!
10.0~Best Superhero Movie ever JSpider13 Sign in Permalink It follows the lines of the comics and keeps the genuine superhero feeling to the viewer. It's almost like reading out of a comic-book, you're drawn to Peter's life and what its like to be Spider-Man. Easily the best superhero movie.
8.0~Amazing movieguy101 Sign in Permalink I saw Spiderman on May 4. It was one of the best movies I have seen since Black Hawk Down and Lord of the Rings. It was worth standing in line for an hour. Tobey Maguire was amazing. Willem Dafoe was magnificent and I think that he should get an oscar nomination for best supporting actor. Kristen Dunst played MJ Watson pretty good, too. Spiderman had good action, and also had some good one-liners. The visual effects were amazing. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I can't wait until the sequels. Hopefully they will be as good as the first one.
7.0~A genuinely ok movie Humpme Dumpme Sign in Permalink Contains Spoiler I think it's normal for people to see a movie they like and rate it highly right away. It's like standing next to a sky scraper and looking straight up at it. You may think it's the tallest thing in the city. But when you stand back a ways, and look at it in comparison with the other buildings around, you can see that it is tall, but is shorter than a lot of buildings around it. Such is the case with Spider Man. I think as time passes people will gain more perspective and will be able to rationally rank this movie. Right now, it is irrationally rated so highly in the top 250. The movie was fun, kind of like The Mummy, but certainly not great. The acting was mediocre, as was the writing and the character development. The special effects could have been a lot better and the ending was awful (I mean, the whole story line was about Peter being in love with MJ and, in the end, when she confesses her love for him, he backs off) Don't get me wrong, I had a lot of fun watching the movie, but it was not intellectually stimulating. It was worth the 9 bucks, but it is not worthy of a top 100 rating.
10.0~pure fun! marcro Sign in Permalink If you are anything of a Spider-Man fan, you should love this movie! Raimi did a wonderful job of telling the story of Peter Parker and the origin of Spider-Man while keeping the action fresh and the characters alive and believable. Tobey Maguire really shined as Petey, that boy can cry on a dime! Kirsten Dunst was solid, of course, and Willem Dafoe is such a good actor, he played off the madness of the Green Goblin without ever sounding hokey. The casting of J.K. Simmons as J.J. Jameson was pure perfection. I had a lot of expectations going into the movie, but it met and exceeded every one. I haven't enjoyed the entire length of a movie in a theater since I saw "The Matrix". And some of the fight scenes in Spider-Man were reminiscent of that movie, but I guess that's the direction movie fight scenes are going. I'm glad. I like that look. Robbie Robertson was in the movie too, albeit a small role. And a couple other small details from the comic were peppered around the movie, making me smile to remember something that was so long ago, but still sweet, to mix my metaphors. It was like watching some of my childhood's favorite comic book characters come alive on the screen. The webbing looked and moved exactly as I had imagined it, and the acrobatic fight scenes were choreographed and shot extremely well. When Peter was discovering his powers, I felt like I was right there with him, scared and excited at the same time. I was truly pumped when I walked out of the movie. One thing I did miss, tho, was the "snappy-patter" that was a trademark of spidey's battles. I guess I'm not a huge David Koepp fan then....I thought the script on Panic Room was week, too. But he did surprise me with a few zingers, and of course there was the famous "With great power comes great responsibility" line...that was my mantra for a while as a kid. Anyway, if you've read this far, thanks, and if you're a Spider-Man fan, I think you'll like this movie. If you're not, I think you should still enjoy this fast-paced, well-acted, well-directed, ride of a two hours movie. What's two hours, anyway?
10.0~So happy I saw it but sad that it ended sangha_dro Sign in Permalink Saw this film for the first time in 2018, and I argue that this film is a truly remarkable acheivement, and a profound experience that NO ONE should miss. 10/10
8.0~Great Movie SherryBaby82 Sign in Permalink Though I was reluctant to see this film (I am not a comic book nor Spiderman buff) I was extremely pleased with this film. I found it extremely entertaining and well written. Tobey Maguire is excellent in his role. I would definitely see it again.
1.0~We've come a long way RE: mainstream diversity & get your science sorted. shaynenicn Sign in Permalink First, in retrospect, seeing big dick Joe in it made this movie incredible erotic. Second, seeing this movie makes me realise how far we've come and how far we need to venture in terms of on-screen, main-stream diversity. Stint of misogyny and homophobia; "This story is about a girl, like any other story." opens the monolog. As a proud gay man I can tell you for sure, nothing in my life, centres and celebrates towards horniness of a female individual. Third, get your molecular biology jargon sorted. Why on earth would anyone tries to generate GMO through transfection with RNA? If they want to make the movie sounds high-tech, at least have the decency to pick up a book and read it. I was just trying to have a quiet afternoon geeking it out a bit and I am now chocked by how unpleasant this has turned out. If this is what the mainstream media is like, I guess there is a reason after all why some people who grew up watching bullocks like this to grow up and vote for Trump.
10.0~A Marvel Masterpiece! diegobastidas15 Sign in Permalink Though spider-man was an excellent movie i have to say there should have been more action and humor. Although this movie is 100% better that crappy 103 million daredevil it totally sucked. Behind Spider-Man is X2 which was totally sweet better than x-men. The hulk which is highly bad to marvel fans the movie made only 132 million domestically i thought it was going to match spider-man's level but i was wrong. X2 was the closest one ever to hit big.The biggest disappointed marvel comic ever was daredevil it only made 103 million domestically and it was totally boring it had no action and humor like spider-man or X2. I think spider-man 2 will be tremendous and it will make at least 450 million domestically. Though i am waiting for sequels to daredevil X2 and spider-man this movie is the best action-marvel comic adaption ever!!!. I give 10/10 A+. And i also have to say that Tobey Maguire was very good in this movie no one could have done it better than him. Although he looked kind of lazy in some scenes, he was good. I can't wait for Spider-Man 2 and 3. I recommend marvel fans don't go see daredevil do not waste your money on trash like that.
8.0~Raimi and Koepp got it right! fx_man Sign in Permalink One of - if not THE - best comic book movie to come along yet. Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe live their respective roles and the script grows out of the development of the main characters themselves. As a result the film finds a down to earth tone that belies its larger than life hero and comes across as a true coming of age story. Filled with genuine emotions, thrills and great fx (some of the shots of Spidey swinging from skyscraper to skyscraper are almost awe-inspiring in their choreographed beauty) this is a bona-fide hit, one that not only avoids insulting its audience but manages to treat it to what a real adventure movie is supposed to be like.
10.0~Wow! LaCarde Sign in Permalink Spider-Man has been my favourite super hero since I was four years old. So needless to say, I was excited to see this movie. However, I wasn't going in with any high hopes. The trailers looked great. Spidey's moves were perfect, but they didn't tell you anything about the story, and that left me a bit worried. Were they hiding something? Was this going to be another one of those f/x driven plot movies? NO! The story was the best part. Oh sure, it was exciting to see Spidey flipping around and swinging past buildings, but the story was great. Even my wife, who usually rolls her eyes and puts up child like enthusiasm when I talk about Spider-Man, enjoyed the film. She was laughing and enjoying the ride. Spider-Man was a great tribute to the comic. It made me feel like a kid again. Heck, it even made me a bit misty.
10.0~Excellent! A True Knockout! luke_502 Sign in Permalink This film is excellent in every aspect. With the title "Spider-Man" comes alot of expectations and this film delivers perfectly! It balances, romance, action and comedy perfectly to keep the watcher completely involved through the entire film. I was always a fan of Spider-Man and I had some great expectations for this film. The effects shine in all scenes as Spider-Man slings webs and crawls up walls flawlessly. At first most thought Maguire an odd choice for the lead role, but he is the perfect choice. He delivers his lines perfectly and always knows how to portray his characters feeling with a glance or gesture. In the same instance I was impressed by the developement of Norman Osborn's character. William Dafoe was perfect for the role and portrays the characters battle with good and evil in himself perfectly. The only complaint I would make about this film is the Green Goblin costume. The mask doesn't let you get a good enough feel for his emotions. The body suit was great and could have worked with a less constricting mask. This film is definetly a must see. Don't miss this rare comic book-to-screen gem, they are rare. Definetly ****1/2 out of *****.
1.0~BATMAN IS STILL BETTER schomburg2002 Sign in Permalink I don't know why everyone is comparing Spider-Man to Batman. There is a difference between Batman and Spider-Man; Batman is way better in character development, story, and motivation. I will admit that Spider-Man was too much hype and not enough movie; it's just not one of those films that makes you want to go, unless you're a giant Spider-Man fan, then you're really going to be disappointed. *SPOILERS* The first thing I would like to address on this film is, where is the character development in The Green Goblin? The Green Goblin has no motivation in killing Spider-Man, so what is the sense in killing him? The only motivation I saw was The Green Goblin killing the executives of Osecorp that are trying to shut him down from the company, and he does kill them IN THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE! Therefore, The Green Goblin doesn't need to be The Green Goblin anymore, but apparently he does. Another loophole I noticed was the whole deal with people NOT KNOWING WHO SPIDER-MAN IS. Come on, is New York really that stupid in not knowing who Spider-Man is? For example, in the wrestling match, the booker literally saw Peter Parker's face in his Spider-Man outfit. Another example, when the balcony was being destroyed and Mary Jane was just laying at the edge of the falling balcony; Parker was stalking at the bottom unbuttoning his shirt and exposing his spider-man shirt with people running by him. You would figure someone passing by would notice, but they don't. Another Green Goblin FLOP I noticed, was Green Goblin didn't do anything that really had any ORIGINAL or memorable plans except for dropping a bunch of kids in a trolley and MJ at the same time, whoopie! Damn, at least The Joker tried to kill everyone in Gotham City. Other than that the movie was decent, but it is no Batman. To make the comparison brief: Batman - more mysterious and more character development. Spider-Man - too many loop holes and lacking in character development. The Green Goblin - no motivation, not convincing, and no real memorable plans. The Joker - memorable plans (Gassing Gotham City, Damn!) Very convincing (that he's crazy) motivation toward his plans and lots of character development. So, basically what I'm saying is; if everyone is comparing Batman to Spider-Man, then they are just Spider-Man fans. It's like comparing Xbox to Playstation 2. You just can't beat what came out first.
10.0~by the way Otto-998 Sign in Permalink Its 120 minutes long Since this is not posted on the IMDB web site Just wanted to point this out to the ones wondering about this.
9.0~Big-budget blockbuster film-making with flair; a blast from start to finish. Pjtaylor-96-138044 Sign in Permalink Sure, at times 'Spider-Man (2002)' is a little cheesy and perhaps even border-line camp, but this is big-budget blockbuster film-making with flair. Sam Raimi's distinct directing style is present and appreciated, even if it is reined in a little. It brings to life a colourful comic-book world in a believable, entertaining way and it's much better than the washed-out, generic stuff we so often see nowadays. The piece can be melodramatic on occasion but it also isn't afraid to get dark, with some sequences actually being pretty brutal (I'll refer you to the final fight between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin, who's defeat is wince-inducing to say the least) and highlighting the dangers of the occupation well, while never losing sight of the heart of the character. The flick is incredibly well-made and, for me, still holds up. It's a true highlight of the genre; a blast from start to finish. 9/10
10.0~On the level of epic storytelling dee.reid Sign in Permalink Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) is lonely, insecure, and is in love with Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst), a girl he has had a crush on since he was six. One day, while on a field trip to a laboratory where they are studying arachnids, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically altered spider that had accidentally gotten out of its cage. Peter goes home in a daze over what has just happened. The next day, he finds himself mysteriously buffed up and no longer needs to wear glasses. So off he goes to school to endure another day of torment by his peers. Just as he is about to start eating lunch, a weird feeling comes to Peter, just as Mary Jane is about to slip in a puddle. Peter catches Mary Jane and her lunch just in the nick of time. After he continues eating, Peter accidentally shoots a string of web from his wrist. While trying to hide the webbing, he accidentally pulls a lunch tray and it hits one of his tormentors in the back. Peter then hauls a** out of the cafeteria. The guy he hit in the back follows Peter, looking for a fight. Peter is able to miraculously overcome his opponent with the use of his new found "spider-sense". On the way home, he begins running and running and finally leaping from building to building and then spinning and spinning. Peter decides to keep his new abilities secret, but when a thief that he could have stopped kills his beloved Uncle Ben, he then decides that he is going to use his abilities to fight crime. It seems that his abilities could not have come at a better time, as he now has to square off against the mysterious and deadly Green Goblin/Norman Osborn(Willem Dafoe). "Spider-Man" definitely is the movie to see this year. The hype surrounding this movie is unbelievable. When I went to see this movie yesterday, the theater was packed. Everybody cheered when Peter beat up that one guy and when he tracked down the man who killed his uncle. It seems to me that this movie affected everyone in the theater the same way. There is a very wide range of emotions to be experienced when watching this movie. Some of the emotions I'm talking about like happiness, loss, grief, and good triumphing over evil to name a few. Sam Raimi of "The Evil Dead" fame is the perfect director for this film. Some of the comic elements that he uses in some of his earlier films are highly present in this film. You should also be on the lookout for Raimi favorite Bruce Campbell in a small cameo as a ring announcer. This movie succeeds because of two key things: smart casting choices and epic storytelling. First off, Tobey Maguire IS Spider-Man! I must admit, that I followed some of my friends when they said that Tobey Maguire could not play Peter Parker. I found out yesterday that is not true. He is Peter Parker, he is Spider-Man. He owns that role. Much as Christopher Reeve played the part of Superman and Michael Keaton was Batman before him, Tobey Maguire will take his place in superhero history as Spider-Man. He is a very good actor in this movie. The scene where he visits Aunt May in the hospital or the ending scene in the cemetery where he talks to Mary Jane about their relationship all go to show how good he can act. Although I have not payed that much attention to Kirsten Dunst, I must admit that she was perfectly cast as Mary Jane Watson. She really has that girl-next-door kind of charisma that is required for a role like hers. Willem Dafoe easily plays one of the best comic book villains of all time as Green Goblin. He's basically torn by grief from loosing his company and from pursuing a life of crime as Green Goblin. The scene where he talks to the Green Goblin mask is one of his best scenes. The costumes for Spider-Man and Green Goblin are some of the most fantastic costume designs and make up effects I've seen since "Dick Tracy". This movie deserves to get an Oscar nomination for Best Costume Design and Best Make Up. The action sequences are some of the best I've ever seen for a superhero movie. The web-slinging scenes, whilst being computer animated, are extremely convincing, largely because they look so real. The scene at the party where Spider-Man and Green Goblin meet for the first time is probably the best action scene in the movie. "Spider-Man" deserves all the praise that it is going to receive, no doubt. I love this movie. I really want to go see it again, but I know that I probably won't be able to. This movie will blow you away, it'll make you want to cheer and it'll make you want to cry. I give "Spider-Man" a big 10.
5.0~Copy and paste origin story gerumghl Sign in Permalink If you want to know what the standard for a superhero origin movie is, this is the place. Everything about the way this movie plays is to have a basic origin about Peter. There wasn't a lot too it.It showcased his powers then, villain. The famous Uncle Ben line was not played out, so was the rest of the acting. Toby McGuire's acting is not really my favorite. His acting is as a boring and tired character. He doesn't even act like a nerd to fit Peter's character. And there was nothing visually good from a superhero who'd be swinging around a lot.
10.0~What a great movie! soon_to_be_actress Sign in Permalink I went to see it the second day it came out. At first i wanted to go to the 8:30 p.m. and the current time was 6 something. It was all sold out besides the 10:00p.m. show. So I went with 2 other friends. It was great...the special effects were fantastic though you could still see when it was real or not. The acting was great except for the guy who played Harry...you could tell he was just acting and wasn't getting really in the whole part of the story. Otherwise everything was fine. Only one other thing, spider-man got easily cut but when he bumped into the walls and almost got his jaw ripped out...he was fine afterwards. I gave it a 10/10 even with all my comments cuz it was great anyways!
10.0~Superman, Batman, Blade, X-Men..... and now.... SPIDER-MAN! wesjordao557 Sign in Permalink Superman was the first and started it all with the comic book movies. It was great at it's time and is now a classic. Later on came Batman another amazing classic. As time went on, we saw other comic book movies such as Ninja Turtles, The Mask, and Men In Black. We later recieved Blade, which started Marvels big movie debut. Than came a bigger movie, X-Men. Now, we finnaly recieve Spider-Man. I can say that Spider-Man is an awsome movie! It's the best comic book movie ever. It stays true to the charecter. Before the movie came out, I was having alot of doubts. I was hoping the movie would be great... and it was. It has everything for everyone. Drama, romance, comedy, and of course, action! This is a movie for everyone, young and old. 10 out of 10.
4.0~Been There... bix171 Sign in Permalink Though he's probably the best choice around, there's an air of desperation in Sam Raimi's direction, as if he needed a hit to reestablish himself on the A-list after duds like `A Simple Plan' and `The Gift', and he reaches into his old bag of tricks, trying to invoke the spirit of his sublime `Darkman'. He fails: the film has a lot of the `Darkman' look--especially the climax, which primarily takes place at night on top of a New York borough bridge--but little of the passion because, unlike the reverence with which Raimi regards the Universal horror films of the thirties and infused into `Darkman', he treats the Marvel Comic source material with an air of condescension, as if it were mere kitsch. And he doesn't stop there, borrowing indiscriminately from the obvious pop icons, the DC Comic-inspired `Superman' and `Batman' films--he doesn't seem to have the slightest desire to bring anything original to the project. The film is awash in computer effects and perhaps it's Raimi's intention to stylize the movement of the action but it seems a bit of a cover-up; there are so many unconvincing moments that you have to spend too much time telling yourself it's done that way on purpose. The script is another lazy hack job by David Koepp (`Panic Room', `Mission: Impossible') who not only hews it close to the Hollywood-101 bone by bringing in all the bullied teenager and father/son pathos he can, but also by stroking the citizenry of New York, elevating them, in the film's most shameless twist, to hero status. Perhaps the real culprit is Sony Pictures: the whole thing reeks of trying to keep the dying comic book film genre alive by aligning it with post-9/11 bloodlust. With Tobey Maguire, competent in the title role, Kirsten Dunst (so-so) as his would-be love interest and Willem Dafoe, pretty good as The Green Goblin.
9.0~Best comic book movie, ever. myeddeau Sign in Permalink I was skeptical going into this film because I've read the Spider-Man franchise of comic books for over 20 years, but man, they nailed this puppy big time. Except for a few minor continuity gaps (no webshooters?!), I had no problems whatsoever with this film. Slick looking, excellent casting, and faithful to the comic. That's all I really asked for.
4.0~Skating dangerously close to the edge of crap movie-making! uds3 Sign in Permalink I wanted to like this flick, I really did, and Sam Raimi is an innovative director, whose career I have avidly followed since EVIL DEAD. I have to tell you however, this is light years behind ARMY OF DARKNESS, even DARKMAN (another comic caper for Raimi!) Toby Maguire was straight-up excellent in the role of Spiderman. He handles the role of science nerd, fortuitously bitten by a missing genetically engineered spider, just perfectly. The early scenes during which he road-tests his new found arachnid skills are deftly handled and at this point, I had the film categorised a 7 or 8. The first set-back was the appearance of Kirsten Dunst, supposedly the "girl next door" but in reality more like a brain-dead 27/28 year old with less appeal than the original spider. The supposed great "love scenes" just never happen and even Maguire himself by the film's end doesn't look that interested either (admittedly, he does have various sequels to worry about!). The film is irredeemably sunk however by the appearance of the Green Goblin. Looking like a retarded piece of junk from an old LOST IN SPACE episode, the film quickly degenerates to a 6. The second half becomes increasingly more stupid and rushed and simply unravels! The fx and CGI are for the most part (In NY) deftly handled but towards the end, during the cable-car-under-the-bridge sequences, they become laughable and insultingly bad. The entire ending is rushed and unsatisfying. That this flick is currently running at an average user-voting of 8.2, elevating it to midway up the top 250 films of all time is simply lunacy - a triumph of marketing hype over intelligence. Un- even and unsustainable in the long run! The film's greatest attribute??? no questions? Danny Elfman's dynamic score - it is brilliant and by far the flick's greatest achievement.
3.0~One more churned out by the popcorn mill Col-3 Sign in Permalink Rarely do I feel as misanthropic as I do when I get home from a movie as bad as this one, and as popular as this one. Sure, it will fade by morning, but until then my dreams will be haunted be the ludicrous villainy, predictable action and motherhood-and-apple-pie cheese of Spider-Man. While Tobey MacGuire was an excellent choice, the whole movie was just lurching through the motions; there were no surprises, the whole thing felt paper-thin. Many cliches were strung together to lengthen the otherwise trivially simple plot - geek getting his own back against high-school bully, agonizing death scenes, and much puppy-dog romance which everyone else seems to have found adorable. I found it simply tedious. While the movie had some nice effects, it is, as one might expect, just another entry in a sad list of superhero flicks that are more or less indistinguishable from one another. Let me give you a hint: the good guy wins.
4.0~Great Special Effects, Stupid Story, Worse than Batman michael94523 Sign in Permalink fell asleep twice. a waste of kirsten dunst's talent. it is true that I am not a comic book reader. Nor, am I under age 11, but grown adults that I respect saw this movie and recommended that I see the movie. When I told them I fell asleep they were shocked. As a side note I loved the X-Men movie and Waking Life.
7.0~Not as good as it was spun up to be. Rob_Taylor Sign in Permalink I was rather disappointed by this movie. Once again I think the hype surrounding it raised my expectations too high and led to an inevitable anti-climax when I saw it. Don't get me wrong, it's a very watchable movie. Plenty of action and effects and with passable enough acting. Just not as good as it was spun up to be (sorry about the pun!) Nice to see Sam Raimi's trademark of action-comedy being continued rather nicely here, though. And it's always cool to see Bruce Campbell getting his usual cameo roles. I only hope that Spiderman 2 will not become just a simple action-fest devoid of plot.
10.0~what a refreshing step back to a time of innocence Negative_Reviews Sign in Permalink What an odd way to describe a Spider-Man movie of all things huh? Well, let me explain. After I saw Spider-Man 3 in 2007, the disgusting display of incompetent film making and lazy attempts to make money and simply get by on the name alone, left me with nothing but a raging hatred in my core for everyone involved in that abomination of a movie. Watching part 1 again reminded me of how magnificent this franchise used to be. I can't believe these characters that I fell in love with- Peter Parker, Mary Jane, Aunt May, Harry, J. Jonah Jameson, are people that I actually wanted to commit felony acts of violence against in part 3 (particularly Mary Jane and Harry). It was so bad and personal, that I even said that if they continue making more Spider-Man movies in the future, that I would like nothing more than Kirsten Dunst NOT to return (a complete contrast to my views of her in parts 1 and 2, where I loved her). Seeing part 3 even made me second guess myself as to whether the first two actually deserved perfect 10s as I originally scored them. Well, seeing them again reminded me that they ABSOLUTELY deserve 10s, and that's why I'm writing this review. I'll stick to talking about part 1 here. **Great job adapting the comic to the big screen. They captured the campy humor of the comics perfectly, with lovable corny one-liners done just well enough to be corny, but not excessively that it becomes a joke. **At it's core, this movie is basically a love story about a nerd awkwardly trying to win over the girl he loves, with things getting a tad bit complicated having to deal with the fact that he's got superhuman powers. This is a romance story story running parallel to a superhero movie, and it's interwoven with expert craftsmanship, it completely engrosses you. **I've gotta give it to Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, they did some great acting here. All of their scenes feel so genuine. Who can't relate to those little moments that they had together? Like every time they happen to meet up by chance, they would say "Oh hey!!!" with a genuine look of surprise as their faces light up with happiness, followed by awkward, nervous conversation masked by their smiles, with Peter consciously making sure to minimize dead air in the conversation. Again, the most authentic thing in all of this is the "oh hey!!!" part. Not sure about everyone else, but in my experience, this is THE default greeting between a male and a female that are moderately close, upon unexpectedly meeting each other (less close could result in a simple, less upbeat, "hey what's up," and more close could be running up and giving them a hug). **There's a certain *simplistic nature to this movie that you become fond of. There's a very dense, linear approach that pretty much forces you to love the characters, and want to see the nerd win the girl, and save the day. **If I had to do one thing differently, I would change the Green Goblin's costume. It was too over the top and cartoonish, they should've modernized the look, make it look like something that would be issued by the military for combat. They wouldn't wear a mask that looked like that.. Parts 1 and 2 compared to part 3 are like day and knight. Regardless of The Dark cloud which is part 3 hanging over this franchise, these first two installments are the best superhero movies made in terms of pure enjoyment.
5.0~Messy, and only about the dollar. mlp2305 Sign in Permalink I'm a fan of the Spider-man comics printed from 1960 through 1980ties. The golden Era of Marvel and Comics in general. These years the Spider-man stories were PURE ART..the stories, the drawings, everything was to say the least..GENIUS. Everything else coming from Marvel after this, being it Comics, Movies or whatever, is pure GARBAGE. Violent, gloomy..for some reason they think that the more people who dies in extreme violent ways, the better it is. WRONG. Originally. When someone died, it was a serious matter. Not today, about 20 people get killed and the bystanders still clap and smiles when Spidey saves Mary Jane. What about the massacre just happened !? This has almost nothing to do with the original spider-man.. My main beef is with the script, not the actors or the effects. But to briefly go there, Tobey don't remind me of PP and Kirsten Dunst don't remind me of MJ. The people behind the original Peter Parker and Spider-Man did a lot of thinking when they created the characters. What they created WORKS. Why change it ? Why did they change his net shooters to organic ? The thought of a human throwing organic web makes me wanna throw up, same with the hair or whatever it is that enables him to climb. Peter Parker arguing with Uncle Ben, telling him not to "act like his dad". This is very out of character for Peter Parker. Peter Parker refusing to stop the mugger that later kills his uncle. In the original it's because he just wants to mind his own business. In the movie, it's sort of to get back at the wrestling manager who cheated him. Again, this is very out of character, Peter Parker does not contain this kind of malice. When Peter Parker find the mugger, he doesn't do anything to save him when he falls out the window. He don't even try. He is facing him unmasked, making it necessary to kill him of course. Again, why change the original story ? Here Spider-Man simply catches the mugger and leave him to the police. Spider-Man is a Super Hero, not a Killer ! But of course, I forgot, if someone is not killed every ten minute, the movie becomes boring ! or so they think. Mary Jane being in love with Spider-Man. She is starting to have a thing going with Peter Parker and suddenly she starts making out with Spider-Man, someone she just met, tongue and all..just wrong on so many levels. As so many things in this movie, it is just there, just for being there, for no reason as it never really lead to anything, or has any consequence. Mary Jane is pretty off character, as this serious, dull girl. A bit nerdy actually. Totally different from in the comics. In the comics there's no reference to her having an abusive dad, there she is living with her mother and have no domestic problems at all. The thing about her father is never used for anything later in the movie, so why was it even mentioned ? Strangely, even though she looks like this nerdy, quiet girl, she still hangs with the cool bunch in the school. Can't they just make up their mind and simply put her in a category ! Just another annoying little thing. Aunt May and Uncle Ben are kind of underdeveloped. You never get any sense of their personalities. Small passages like Uncle Ben just having lost his job keeps you alert to what next what will happen to him now, but of course, this is never mentioned again and was just there because they didn't know what else to put there. Peter Parker fighting Flash Thompson in the can tine using his super powers and throwing webs all over. None wonders about why the weakling Peter Parker suddenly can beat the strongest guy on campus...or why he is suddenly moving in bullet time ! Stupid really. I had still a vague hope for the movie before this, but not after. This is by the way the only reference to Flash Thompson, a huge character in the Spider-Man universe. From a movie standpoint, also if you forget that this is Spider-Man, it is kind of boring. Doesn't change pace, is never really thrilling, kind of rushes you through the movie which is over before you know it. No real character development. Suddenly we're at the final fight which Peter Parker just wins with no real problems. This movie proves that a good franchise can always sell when converted to a movie, as long as is it well advertised. They make you buy the ticket and after there's nothing you can do.
9.0~Amazing!! offvader Sign in Permalink A near perfect movie. Exceptions. Even for a fantasy movie I found some of the physics of the movie hard to believe. Second the special effects although amazing seemed a little lacking. Still a great movie I look forward to seeing again!!
8.0~The best super hero film made so far. CharltonBoy Sign in Permalink Its about time we had a good super hero film made especially after the lousy Batman films and the extremly dated Superman series and Spiderman IS a good film. The special affects are outstanding and the story is interesting too. It's not dark and depressing like the batman films and the actor playing the lead role is not there just for his looks which makes a change. It is the best super hero film i have ever seen (not including Mystery men which is a comedy and is better) and lays down the standard for the up and coming Superman and hulk film that are due to be made. Kids and adults will like this and its not to violent for the younger kids too. Recomended. 8 out of 10.
10.0~Fantastic! g-bodyl Sign in Permalink The Spider Man trilogy is one of those superhero films that rivals the first two Batman movies for the best superhero movies of the 21st century. The first one really sets the tone for the whole trilogy. I really enjoyed this film. I wish that I saw in theaters then I could have enjoyed it better. This movie is about the origins of Spider Man and how Peter Parker transformed into the web-slinging superhero. The villain, The Green Goblin, is about to show Spider Man who's the real man. The acting is pretty good. I just wanted to punch Tobey Maguire because he is an absolute nerd but he was all right. Kirsten Dunst is perfect as Mary Jane Watson. When I saw some scenes here I was reminded of Spider Pig in the Simpsons Movie. That made me enjoy the movie more. Overall, this is a fantastic movie. There are great special effects and the music by Danny Elfman is wonderful. I rate this film 10/10.
8.0~Peter's almost got the best of both worlds kalendra274 Sign in Permalink I've seen this movie a long time ago, there are only a few parts that I can remember which is ; a scene from the beginning, when he is chasing the school bus, when he got bitten by the spider and when he was bullied at school. Weird isn't it? It was such a long time ago, but I still can remember how great the movie was! It had such a excellent comic adaption, as I am a big fan of Spider-Man and read the comics, all I can say that movie is a bit different to the comics. One thing is because it illustrates Spider-Man fighting against the Venom and then we come to the end of the comic and it says Spider-Man saves the world once more. I know boring, eh. What I'm saying is that you can't compare the whole movie to the comics, because the movie also has terms which do not related to saving the world or fighting against a villain (I'm not saying Spider-Man don't save the world at the end and fight against a villain, of course he does!) I'm just saying there has never been a comic about Peter's high school life, so you can't compare some of the movie to the comic, his school life is way different from his other life (saving the world as Spider-Man) in his school life he is a very shy, geeky boy who is the laughing-stock of the school and gets bullied by people and when you look at Spider-Man's life, it's way different. Enough about the comics and the movie, the performances from the cast were throughly effortless, especially by Tobey Maguire who, as we all know, plays the shy, outgoing Peter Parker and also plays the kick-but superhero Spider-Man. The plot was great too, completely solid from start to finish, and I thought this movie is going to have too many characters that it starts to get a bit confusing, well I was certainly wrong about that! So if you're a Spidey fan, want to watch him do some superhero action, why not watch this? It might surprise you!
9.0~This Blockbuster Deserves It gbheron Sign in Permalink What can one say about "Spider-Man", the summer of 2002's big summer blockbuster? It deserves it, sure, but what makes it special? The special effects? They're fantastic, but by 2002 any A-List, Big Opening Weekend movie better nail the cool effects, Hell, even mediocre movies are doing a damn good job at this nowadays. No, I felt three things set Spider-Man apart. First was the casting. Tobey Maguire was perfect for Peter Parker. Willem Dafoe never climbed over the top with his Norman Osborne aka Green Goblin role. Kirsten Dunst as the love interest, James Franco as the rival, and Cliff Robertson as Parker's grandfather; all excellent choices who deliver the goods. Second was the dark edge to the story, reminiscent of the two Tim Burton Batman movies. Not everything is perfect in this comic book, good people die, and good deeds are not always rewarded. I like this. And lastly, and related to the dark edge, is the end of the movie. I don't want to spoil anything, but the movie has a very satisfying although not entirely happy ending, which leaves the door wide open for the sequel.
6.0~A 6 from a Comic Book Fan, Why? bambammsu Sign in Permalink I'm a mediate comic book fan, and Spider-Man has always been one of my favorite movies of all time, but this movie could have been better. I guess I was expecting something a little less cornballish from fellow MSU grad Sam Raimi and something a little more darker. All my friends say that it is based on a comic book and it's supposed to be cornballish in ways, but that isn't true. Look at Batman, that was seriously with a little and proper comedy relief in the mix. Tim Burton should have directed Spider-Man. Don't get me wrong, I loved the action packed scenes and for once I actually enjoyed the CGI (which I normally hate). Although I didn't really care for Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man, I did, however, thought that Willem Dafoe played an excellent green goblin and who could not love the very beautiful Kirsten Dunst. The reason why I gave this a 6, is that in between all these great action scenes were these over-acted, and cornballish dialogue and romance scenes. That is what spoiled this movie.
6.0~Spoiler aussiepatrick-1 Sign in Permalink Saw a sneak preview and toby maguire is not your superhero, if anything he needs to be tougher for this part and looked out of place being the webslinger. Great Effects!..Great Effects...but it isn't a movie you need to wait and see, wait till the lines die down.
9.0~A very good movie beatnick49 Sign in Permalink Not a fan of comic books I find that the movie adaptations are very entertaining (with the exception of The Punisher) and rather than be simple beat'em up flicks with no story and little talent, they are in fact quite the opposite, and this movie is no exception. While the concept of the weak rising to be strong is a very common theme, it makes a welcome change to what could have been a plotless action flick. The characters in this movie are all likeable. They are quite human for movie characters, they are vulnerable and their appearances conceal their realities, Peter Parker may acquire superhuman strength, but is quite lonely, Mary Jane Watson maybe popular and pretty but comes from a broken home, and the Osborns maybe rich but there is little amity between them. They pursue hard to reach targets with Peter pining after Mary Jane, Mary Jane gets a drab start to her acting career, the Osborns try to understand each other but can't take the initiative, while corporate success for Norman Osborn proves elusive. In a movie it's a good thing to have sympathetic protagonists, and this movie delivers. The actors are all well picked, and play their parts well. Tobey Maguire gives a good, sympathetic performance as Peter Parker, who you jusy feel sorry for, and I was happy to see him pound that Flash. Kirsten Dunst gives a good, sympathetic performance as Mary Jane Watson, and is cute too. Willem Dafoe plays Norman Osborn (who is sympathetic at first but then becomes a total jerk-wad) well, he is also very good as Osborns alter ego the Green Goblin, he's not an overblown villain. James Franco is pretty good as well, as Harry Osborn. Rosemary Harris plays a sweet Aunt May, and J.K.Simmons is amusing as Peter's employer. The scripting is good as well, it's a solid story that doesn't detract from the narrative. It's well directed by Sam Raimi, with the story moving along at a steady pace (helped along by the good cast) with the special effects and action ,which are impressive to watch, complementing the story rather than the other way around. The movie doesn't forget that it is an action movie, yet balances the visuals and character interractions very well; combined with the scripting it proves to be an engaging flick. It also goes at just the right amount of time at two hours and one minute. There's also some funny moments such as Peter trying to release the web, and Harry's end of the conversation with MJ after the fair. I certainly got my money's worth at the cinema, and I have seen it repeatedly on cable, yet have not got bored of it. In all it proves to be an entertaining, watchable movie. I would like to give it an eighrt and a a half, but since that's not possible I give it a nine out of ten because I enjoyed it so much. A very good movie. movie
9.0~Top comic book adaptation BadWebDiver Sign in Permalink This is a brilliant adaptation of a comic book character, capturing both the fantasy action elements, and the wit and humanity. I thought the third act dialogue sounded a tiny bit cliched, but overall the concept was brilliant. I think congratulations should go not only to the director and main cast, but the supporting players as well - particularly the guy who plays the newspaper editor. He did a "stereotypical" comic book humorously hard-nosed boss to perfection (something I thought modern Hollywood couldn't do anymore!) Great movie; a very worthy summer blockbuster (and how often do you hear someone say that?)
4.0~ughhhhhhhhh! ccjuggalo69 Sign in Permalink i just don't get it. this movie is making soooo much money it means that people are going to see it again?? why??? this movie was sooooo boring. the storyline was weak, and the action scenes were dull. the only thing this movie did effectively was set up a sequel. this movie would have been alot better if it was about 40 minutes shorter. it was simply too long and they did not do enough with it for it to be a 2 hour movie. boo
5.0~Not Worth The Hype mjos1 Sign in Permalink Well I finally saw Spider Man and I thought it was just OK. It seemed more like teen movie then an action flick. I do have to admit that the effects were great and the costumes were too. And it definetly leaves open enough room for a sequel and I will probably see that too.
10.0~Best Super-Hero Movie Yet anime_hair Sign in Permalink I'm a big Marvel Comics fan, but I'll admit the Spider-Man comic never did it for me. When I saw the X-men movie I thought it was okay, but nothing special. Therefore I had pretty low expectations for Spider-Man. Boy was I pleasantly surprised. Instead of relying entirely on great action, like Blade, or on mood and setting, like Dick Tracy and Batman, this creative team relied on great character relationships that subsequently drove the action. As a result, it's not just a great super-hero movie, it's a great movie.
9.0~Fantastic film, marred only by mediocre music msecour Sign in Permalink This is easily the best comic transfer to film since Superman. Tobey McGuire is brilliantly cast in the lead and his acting skills are a joy to behold. Kirstin Dunst is a remarkable young talent and makes it clear she is an actress we will see a lot of in the future. The acting, the script, and the special effects are all top notch. I was bothered only by the incredibly disappointing music. A film like this deserved much more than an uninspired collection of clichés performed on a synthesizer. Had they not cut corners with the music score, I would have rated the movie a 10. Let's hope they go first rate with the sequels.
7.0~Not bad, but why on earth did this one break all the records? basrutten Sign in Permalink For a comic book adaptation, "Spider-Man" certainly isn't a bad movie. The acting is good, the special effects are mostly excellent except for the extremely fake Green Goblin suit, and the whole thing stays very faithful to the comic (as far as I know, I haven't read too many of them). But it's also a very predictable movie. In fact, it's one of the most predictable movies I've ever seen: everything happens exactly the way I expected it would , including the compulsory romance story, which, although not as bad as the one found in "Star Wars: Episode 2", is still not very interesting. On the plus side, the fight scenes are often spectacular (owing a lot to "the Matrix", but hey, which other contemporary action film doesn't ?), and there are plenty of good jokes to laugh about. But overall, I really don't understand what's so special about this movie, why it broke all the records and why it's still in the IMDB 250. My guess is that it will probably drop out of it as soon as this flick gets released on DVD/Video. Entertaining and good looking movie with good action, but way too predictable. **1/2 out of **** stars
8.0~Much better than the reviews would have us believe twiss54 Sign in Permalink I read the reviews, waited past the first two weekends, and sat down to what I expected would be ho-hum special effects and a so-so story. I was pleasantly surprised. The story was fairly faithful to the Marvel version, and I thought Maguire gave more dimension to his superhero than any of his cloaked and masked predecessors. Granted, he's onscreen about 95% of the time, but that didn't seem like overexposure in this case. Contrary to most reviews I read, Dafoe makes a great Green Goblin, troubled and insane and evil. He didn't steal the movie as Nicholson's Riddler did in Burton's 'Batman,' but I consider that a plus. Maybe it's because so much studio hype has come out about the 'maybe' romance between Maguire and Dunst (and I consider it just 'hype'), but there seemed to be some onscreen chemistry there. Special effects were much better than Roger Ebert would have you believe.
6.0~better and better the trilogy goes then made a big drop marblen Sign in Permalink The first spider man was great the second was even better then the third took a big drop. Not saying the the films were terrible they were very good but the fact that the third was bad was not what i was expecting. William Defoe in the first was a great green goblin. Toby was a great spider-man. could of been more action scenes but great overall. The second spider-man had an even better villain and tons of action. Yet the third movie took a BIG I MEAN BIG DROP. Toby wasn't as good as he usually is and his performance just disappointed me. I could not get past it. I am giving the a six because Sam ruined a really good spider-man trilogy.
9.0~Spider Man is an Amazing movie DJAkin Sign in Permalink Ok, I liked Spiderman, eventhough the computer generated superhero was obviously computer generated. That worked thought for the web slinger. Toby Maguire was great and much less an amature as he has been in his previous movies. The chemisty between him and Dunst was wonderful. I also liked the Green Goblin played by the wonderful Willem DeFoe. However, the costume that DeFoe wore was kind of silly. His laugh was intense. I also liked the person that played Jonnah Jameson!! His way of talking was cracking me up!! They sure didn't have him enough in it. I am sure he will be a character in the upcoming sequals. What's the deal with Harry? He was saying that he will avenge his father's death and kill spiderman. Does this mean that Harry will become a super villian? I wonder who he will play? Dr. Octopus? I also liked the music by Danny Elfman in this movie. It fit Sam Raimi's directorial style very well. The movie had tinges of darkness in it. This movie delivered the goods.
8.0~Spider-man wright89 Sign in Permalink There is a certain formula used when making a superhero film. Spider-man is no exception. Based off of the Marvel Comics this movie brings the comic strip hero to life. Peter Parker, played by Tobey Maguire, is your ordinary, unpopular, socially awkward, character who is infatuated with a girl who seems to be out of his league, Mary Jane, played by Kristen Dunst. Has lived next door to Peter for most of his life, and he has been infatuated with her for the entire time, however due to his current social status he's never been comfortable making his move. Also in following the usual formula of the superhero films, this everyday ordinary guy, gets extraordinary powers. The theme of this film like many other superhero films is good verses evil. This film is set in a major city setting for more dramatic impact. Once Peter Parker is transitioned into his superhuman powers, Spider-man is constantly battling with himself and evil. He must fight to protect the ones he loves. Spider-man he battles himself against things he cannot change. He must deal with not being able to reveal his true identity to the ones he cares about. The film has much action, however some of the digital effects and computer graphics appear unrealistic. This is not the case with all scenes, but is worth mentioning. Some of the graphics used were before their time and could have been done differently and better. The general idea of what was trying to be conveyed during the specific scenes was successful, and those who do put much thought into graphics will have no problem with this portion of the film. Through struggles, battles, trials, and triumphs, does the hero always prevail? Sometimes, but it is not without conflicts and sacrifice. As seen in this film, it becomes apparent to the hero that the ones he loves will always be the ones who pay, and "with great power comes great responsibility". Spider-man feels he has a responsibility to protect those he loves and keep good people from harms way. These tasks may become challenging as he is only one man with one extraordinary gift. For those who enjoy an action movie, that is somewhat predictable but always entertaining, where good takes on evil and challenges are never out of sight. This film is these things and more. Spider-man contains, action ,drama, suspense, romance, tragedy. Although it does follow the formula of a typical superhero movie, the characters of this film give it a life of it's own as Maguire brings Spider-man to life.
2.0~Manufactured entertainment for the thinking-challenged MrSpoonzy Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is utter drivel, manufactured entertainment for the unintelligent or lazy thinkers of this country. The only saving aspect of this film is the mediocre action scenes, but hardly anything worth hype. When will Hollywood learn that you can't force emotional scenes with a blaring sentimental soundtrack and a dialauge of cliches. Its nothing but comedy! This would be a great peice for a film class to study aspects of bad film! Rating: 2/10
10.0~If rated 1 out of 10, this movie deserves a 7 or higher. bonbonbabie Sign in Permalink When I heard that Spider-man was going out in theaters, I didn't really expect a great movie. After all, the current adaptations haven't been the best in the world; Harry Potter, for example, was a huge let-down because of the enormous missing chunks and dullness. I've been a Spider-man fan for as long as I can remember, and I guess I didn't want to see some director screw up my favorite super hero's reputation by making a below-average movie. I'm just that kind of girl who can't stand a disappointment. And so, on opening day, I listened to my friends talk about how they wanted to see the movie so badly, and when they asked if I wanted to go with them, I refused the offer. But one of the movie-goers later told me it was an excellent movie and I should watch with him (he wanted to watch it again. I was surprised) again. And so I did, and my reaction was one of pure amazement. First of all, the casting is excellent. Tobey Maguire made a great Spider-man, much to my surprise. He played Peter Parker like Peter Parker should be. I don't mean the sharp-tongued witty sort of guy most super heroes are, but just a regular person who, of course, can mess up. I thought Kirsten Dunst wasn't the right type of person for the part of M.J., but she played the role pretty well. Her little speech at the end was corny and mushy, and I didn't like that too much. The Green Goblin was the best of the actors and actresses. When you watch him, you can see that he isn't acting out his part well; he IS his part. I really hated the people who would go, "Oh! It's Spider-man!" or a stupid line like, "Oh gee! What's that in the sky?" It got really annoying after a while and I was thinking, "Yes it's Spider-man, you idiots." The people in this movie were great nevertheless, whether they made the audience laugh, scream, cry, or fall off (or jump out of) their seats. The plot was a bit off. It's just sort of the regular good against evil sort of theme and everyone knows how that will end. I did liked how the director didn't make the entire movie about the action and the explosives and the kicking and the leaping from bombed buildings and all that extra action stuff some people add to their movies to increase an audience's excitement level. There was actually a back story and mixed in tid bits that gave this movie a harder punch. But augh! The special effects were really bad! The scenes where Spider-man is swinging around the city in his costume were okay, and most of the action sequences were okay, but otherwise, they stank. The impression the audience gets in certain parts is, "Wow. That was really fake," and the people watching the movie won't believe the story anymore. These are only some of the points. I do think though, that this movie definitely deserves at least, if rated one out of ten, an 8 (I think it'd have to be one heck of a movie to get a ten ;-P) ~Bonnie *huggies and kisses* Email me!~
8.0~"We are who we choose to be. Now choose!" ryanskywalker-87402 Sign in Permalink One of the first movies to pave the groundwork for modern superhero flicks, Spider-Man is an incredibly fun & endlessly entertaining action-adventure that brings its web-slinging hero to life on the silver screen in a truly fascinating manner after spending nearly a quarter of a century in development hell and, with its record- breaking box office performance, acts as a precursor to an era when superheroes would dominate the summer box-office. Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, the story of Spider-Man follows Peter Parker; a high-school kid who after being bitten by a radioactive spider at a genetic laboratory begins to develop spider-like abilities and puts his new powers to good use by turning to crimefighting. Meanwhile, Norman Osborn experiments a power-enhancing drug on himself as a desperate attempt to preserve a military contract critical for his company's survival. Directed by Sam Raimi, Spider-Man has all the ingredients of a summer blockbuster plus it benefits a lot from Raimi's dynamic filmmaking style that doesn't dwell on a single moment for far too long, keeps the story fresh, light-hearted & action-packed for the most part, plus never loses its initially-gained momentum. David Koepp's screenplay is no slouch either for it packs in a compelling plot & few interesting characters and the whole story is cheesy but well humoured. The technical aspects are all brilliantly executed. Camera-work is excellent for the most part for the chosen angles, swift movements, slow-mo shots & warm colour palette are correctly employed. Editing provides a frenetic pace to its narrative, each moment has a role to play, and its 121 minutes of runtime simply flies by. Visual effects team makes use of both CGI & practical stuntwork and it's amazing just how well it has aged when compared to other effects-laden movies released back then. Coming to the performances, Spider-Man packs in a very interesting cast in Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Willem Dafoe, J.K. Simmons & others, and many of them are pretty convincing in their given roles. Maguire does a terrific job under Raimi's supervision, Dafoe plays Norman Osborn with finesse but that Green Goblin suit is extremely off-putting, Simmons is a near-perfect rendition of J. Jonah Jameson from the comics while both Dunst & Franco do a fine job as Mary Jane Watson & Harry Osborn, respectively. Also worthy of admiration is Danny Elfman's outstanding score that captures just the right tone & feel of your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man's universe and brims with tracks that seamlessly integrate into the story. On an overall scale, Spider-Man may not seem as impressive today as it did back when it made its debut on the silver screen but it still remains one of the best offerings of its category and delivers a roller- coasted ride that's enjoyable, entertaining & highly satisfying. Spider-Man is a summer popcorn extravaganza right on the money.
10.0~Simply Fantastic D. Vader-2 Sign in Permalink I was lucky enough to see this movie on opening Day, May 3rd. I was blown away. My god, the movie was great. Words cannot fully describe how much I enjoyed this movie. I really was shocked, i didnt think that the Movie would come close to doing the Comicbook-classic justice. But the webslinger arrives in style, and catches the audience just like flies. (laff) Lots of action which will keep you on the end of your seat throughout most of the movie. Anyone who allows the absence of the web canisters bog them down is a fool, a FOOL I tell you!! SEE this movie, at least 3 times, i know i will. 9/10
9.0~Great comic book fun! Anonymous_Maxine Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi has truly come a long way since his work on the infamous Evil Dead trilogy. He had been making major motion pictures for several years at the time that he began the Spiderman trilogy, and has made movies even better than this (A Simple Plan seems clearly like his best work since moving into "mainstream" movies), but Spiderman is a surprisingly fun adaptation, coming amidst a seemingly endless barrage of disappointing comic book movies. I have to admit that I was immediately put off by Toby Maguire as the title character (and he still doesn't at all match my original impression of what kind of person the comic book Spiderman was, but his performance is so good that he embodies the character in a way that enables you to overlook the difference between what you seen and what you always imagined. This is a major obstacle to overcome, and if it's done right, you are in for a treat. New York City is captured with a brilliant reality that reminds me of great films like Do The Right Thing, but retains a sense of excess and hyper-reality, namely through some of the characters, like the loud-mouthed Jonas Jameson (played with hilarious overkill by J.K. Simmons), the editor of the newspaper Peter Parker works for. Admittedly, some of the flying through the city streets scenes are less than convincing with their total reliance on digital effects, but amazingly it doesn't look at all out of place here, probably because the only Spiderman we've known until now has been nothing but drawings. The only real complaint I would make about the movie is the costume of the villain, The Green Goblin, played with cartoonish craziness by Willen Dafoe. For all of the sheer size of the movie, it is amazing that they chose what looks like a plastic, dime-store mask for him, and a lot of the battle scenes between him and Spiderman seem genuinely contrived. Nonetheless, the movie is one of the best examples of good popcorn fun that I can think of in recent memory. It is pure, fun entertainment and even features a love story that doesn't seem forced into a movie where it doesn't belong. Kirsten Dunst gives a warm-hearted performance as the increasingly fascinated and fascinating Mary Jane, as her relationship with Peter Parker evolves but never feels predictable. The opening of the movie, where we learn what mishap created Spiderman, is wonderfully presented and lends a sense of fascination to the upcoming adventures. Sadly, the film is easy to pick apart, but overall it's just good fun. Nice work!
6.0~The movie is part comic-book wonder, part warmed-over "Superman" moonspinner55 Sign in Permalink I know popcorn-epics like "Spider-Man" can't dwell over every little detail, but director Sam Raimi is so hectic and insistent on pushing this thing along, he loses the narrative punch in the F/X muddle. The movie is a big, loud, dumb entertainment, colorful on a certain level and lots of fun at the beginning--revealing a sneaky sense of humor--yet it becomes more staid and familiar as it progresses. Yes, Spider-Man is a super-hero and we need to see him using his powers for the good of the nation, but Raimi loses the beguiling magic inherent at the beginning while constantly pushing forward with 'bigger and better' ideas. The obligatory hammy performances are here, but Tobey Maguire is curiously low-keyed and oddly charming in the lead. **1/2 from ****
10.0~Fun, exciting and funnny. Perfect adaption from the comics. fstinz_23 Sign in Permalink Being a huge comic book collector in the 1980s, Spider-man was by far my favorite. This movie was perfectly done. I wasn't sure about Toby Maguire, but I was wrong, he portrayed Peter Parker perfectly. He played him as a scrawny nerd, and the youtrhful enjoyment he showed after he got his powers was fun to watch. I didn't want to the movie to end, it was funny, exciting and fun. It brought back so many great childhood memories about reading the comics. William Dafoe was perfectly cast as the Green Goblin. This is a movie for all ages, and I can't wait to see it again and again. Nuff said.
7.0~A good action film, except... ercciman_88 Sign in Permalink Otherwise the movie would be an excellent action film, but there's something wrong with the ending. It's disgustingly patriotic. "You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us". What a load of crap. I know the end has been altered after the 911 accident, and this s#!t wasn't there in the original version, I'm pretty sure. It's just a cheap trick to cash in some more dough from the Americans, who were all shocked at the time. Also the line "Aunt May, aunt May, is that an angel? " makes me vomit every time I see it. It's such a cliché line. I'm sure they could've come up with something better. Otherwise, the movies great, it has some of the most impressive fighting scenes in it, and JJJ is hilarious. Every time he opens his mouth, I'm ready to burst.
9.0~"Here Comes the Spiderman" lee3993 Sign in Permalink Finally, a super hero movie that I can sink my teeth into. Not since Christopher Reeve's "Superman" movie have I been so amazed at what modern technology can achieve on the big screen. As a child I loved comic books, and without a doubt my favorite character was "Spiderman". This movie seems to bring to life the hero that I wished I could be growing up in a small town. The only reason I don't give "Spiderman" a 10 is that the Green Goblin's costume was overdone. Willem Dafoe looks more like the goblin without the mask. His character would have been more believable if his mouth could move. They should have just painted him green and used prosthetics to enlarge his ears. Aside from that, the story of Peter Parker becoming the "Spiderman" is just like I remembered it in the comic books. This made the movie that much more enjoyable. Also, Tobie Maguire cast as Spiderman rivals Christopher Reeve's turn as Superman. I just hope that if the Goblin resurfaces (and he probably will - being Spiderman's arch nemesis) in any upcoming Spiderman movies, they change the costume to look more realistic.
6.0~Spider-Man vs. Peter Parker tomm4004 Sign in Permalink For me this felt like two films - Spider-Man and Peter Parker. The latter is the story of a geeky kid amazingly transformed into a superhero while pursuing a career and the girl of his dreams. It is the most interesting part of the duo. On the plus side it had the reliable Toby Maguire portraying convincing teenage angst, laced with wide-eyed humour at his newly adopted powers. On the downside, I found Maguire and Kirsten Dunst a bit laconic at times, though fault probably lies with the helmsman Sam Raimi for his static handling of their scenes. They basically just stand and talk to each other while the music tries hard to drown them out. Couldn't they have walked or something? Parker takes to his new powers like a duck to water without ever really questioning or having any doubts about them. It all seemed a little too pat. Also, one major plot point - the identity of the car jacker - was a real give away, then never really dealt with. As Peter Parker the movie dissolved into Spider-Man the movie it got tangled up in its own webbing. The action scenes were functional but never engaging or thrilling. One main problem was that the hero and villain were masked and thus not able to exude emotion or personality. The director tried to circumvent that a couple times, including the final battle, probably realizing the problem. Also, the web-spinning scenes were very cartoonish and I never had a sense of danger or of "being-there". Whenever Mary Jane was going to fall it was obvious that Spidey would swoop in and save her, thus there was no sense of danger. There's also a plot device in a fire that was telegraphed, hence making the "predictable" line seem like a bad in-joke. Somehow Spider-Man zipping around the tops of buildings just wasn't exciting to watch. I would have bet that it would be, as I'm sure the filmmakers did, but some things just don't come off well on film. It's just the way it goes. I remember my favourite shot from the old TV cartoon - it was of a two-fisted Spidey coming right at the camera. I can't remember any specific shot from this film that had the same thrilling effect. It was nice to have the story of Peter Parker come to the big screen and see what they could do to Spider-Man with modern computer technology. Unfortunately, the latter was "not much." Now that the story of the geek gone vigilante has been told, it doesn't bode well for the sequels.
8.0~Pretty good start for the franchise scott-sw Sign in Permalink I had been looking forwards to the Spider-Man movie since the mid 1980's. I started collecting Amazing Spider-Man at the age of nine and had all from #150 to 400 along with all other accompanying titles. I was so anxious to see how film maker Sam Raimi would do it. He did not disappoint, although he took the mythology a different direction. Instead of a radio active spider born out of the fear of nuclear holocaust, we have a genetically altered born of the fear of genetic tampering. Also, instead of Peter Parker creating his web from science, his body creates. We follow the same predictable plot line of Peter wanting to use his powers to wrestle in order to get money. When a robber takes the money winnings, Peter has a chance to stop him but doesn't. Later, when he tracks Uncle Ben's killer, he finds the same robber. Now we have to hear "with great power comes great responsibility." Peter is now driven by guilt to be responsible and stop the bad guys. Unfortunately, one of those bad guys is very powerful. The Green Goblin comes in with his glider and explosives to wreck havoc on New York. It is up to Spidey to stop him. First, Tobey McGuire was perfectly cast as the nerdy, smart, and introverted Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He gives the character depth, charm, and wit. Peter finds a lot of self confidence through his super hero persona. Also well cast was James Franco as Harry Osborne. He is the good friend embarrassed by excessive wealth on his father's part. Even better was G.K. Simmons as Daily Bugle Publisher J. Jonah Jameson. He is the fast-talking opportunist who uses his rag with more abuse than Joseph Putlitzer and William Randolph Hearst combined. Willhelm Defoe plays Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. He is the entrepreneur and scientist who is driven to the edge by his own obsession. My only gripe is that his mask prevents us from seeing the emoting from his eyes and face. Kirsten Dunst makes Mary Jane believable, strong, and forceful. She made the role her own and made it work well. Also, a congratulations must be given to Rosemary Harris who gives the Aunt May a personality that was never strong in the comics. Director Sam Raimi gives us a real story about real people, which is what made the comic a gem. The audience can identify with the different characters. They have precedence over the special effects, which are outstanding in their own rite. While the original X-Men got the super hero to movie craze started, this one put the idea on the map.
7.0~Spider-Man isn't Batman coopdale Sign in Permalink I've saw it with great expectation. The Raimi, Spider-Man. There's no sign of Raimi's touch. Several scenes are really great, especially after Ben Parker died, Peter swore for revenge with his lack of Spideyability. Those shots were few best one in the movie. I wish there's more. The movie is intended for the non-knowing Spider-Man. The expectations are so high, the Raimi won't take the chance to make movie in his way. Evident adversary, and expectable his move. Maybe this movie can't live up with its hype. What a shame!
10.0~great all the way through renae774 Sign in Permalink This movie was wonderful. I must say I wasn't sure what to expect when I first went into the theater, but it surpassed all expectations. I had never really been a big fan of the comic book area of things but I am now, and I am anxiously waiting for the second one to come into theaters so that I hopefully will be amazed and entertained once again. I just loved the way that Tobey Maguire portrayed the emotionally torn and socially outcast Peter Parker, and Kirsten Dunst the emotionally abused Mary Jane Watson. They both seemed to bring to life characters that have been read of by readers for years who were finally brought onto the screen. And then there was the score. Danny Elfman truly captured the feel of this movie in the writing of the music. It makes you cry and laugh at the proper times. It gives you a sense of something being wrong or somethings going to happen. Really very well done.
7.0~Nicely done russem31 Sign in Permalink Spider-man, in the hands of director Sam Raimi has made this film one of the more spectacular comic book superhero films. Though this isn't as good as the first Superman and Batman movies, it definitely is up there. The pluses are Raimi's direction, the proper casting of Tobey Maguire as the title character and Kirsten Dunst as his love interest Mary Jane Watson. But real kudos goes to James Franco as Harry Osborn (I look forward to his character being developed in the sequels). Also, kudos to Danny Elfman for composing a unique theme for Spider-man (though his Batman theme is better this one is only a shade paler). This is a nicely done film - a 7 out of 10.
8.0~With the rights to a great franchise comes great responsibilities... and Raimi is up to the job! Funky A Sign in Permalink I always loved comic book super-heroes, like the X-Men, Batman, Superman and, of course, Spider-Man. So the fact that so many Marvel movies are going to be released is great news for me. After the very good but a bit disappointing X-Men, I couldn't wait to see what Sam Raimi would do with Spider-Man. And I must say the overdose of CGI that was the preview of this movie made me fear for the worst, and I didn't see Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. But what Sam Raimi delivers is an excellent super-hero movie that will also entertain regular moviegoers! Raimi's love of the main character is undeniable and he approches the Webslinger with the light entertaining touch required, dosing funny moments and action scenes perfectly while not forgeting to devellop the storyline, which the movie does very well, dealing with the origins of Spider-Man in a way that wont bore anyone, even those who came to see loads of nonstop action and can't wait for something to blow up... He also deals with the death of important characters very well. But the two biggest surprises came from Tobey Maguire and the special effects. Maguire was perfect in his role and the special effects were not an overdose of high-budget but cheap-looking CGI we have been getting recently. It seems some people think that if it is CGI, people can only think it looks good, although some creatures in movies like The Lord of the Rings weren't very convincing. Well, in Spider-Man, the job is well-done. Of course, Willem Dafoe was amazing as the Green Goblin... But can Willem Dafoe be anything else but great? JK Simmons is the J. Jonah Jameson everyone wanted and as anyone who loved the Evil Dead movies, I was pleased to see Bruce Campbell! Kirsten Dunst was cute and that is the only thing she had to do and the rest of the cast was good. Now, of course, the movie wasn't perfect and some of the dialogue was cheesy. But apart from the dialogue, Spider-Man is everything it had to be: an incredibly entertaining movie that will please people who love comic books and people who just want to see a good summer movie, with great characters (although the Green Goblin ain't the best Spidey villain ever and I will be more than happy to see a Venom/Carnage or Mysterio movie) and a good introduction to what is sure to become a very popular franchise. 84%
1.0~to much hype Trinity_4 Sign in Permalink This film had to much hype,supposedly the film of the year ,the best super hero film of the last 10 years.Personally i thought it sucked it was one of the worst films i`ve ever seen.the ending was the most disappointing part and the green goblin was ridiculous,not scary.The fight scenes mimiced the matrix and didn`t do that well at all.As for the acting Toby Maguire is a good actor ,in fact he is to good for this half hearted film,Kirsten Dunst was good as the damsel in distress because thats as far as her acting abilities go.One thing that made me think this was a rubbish film was i also saw star wars episode 2 in the same week and it was amazing which put this predictable hollywood blockbuster to shame.If you have`nt seen it yetI worn you DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON
8.0~special effects worth it dhaufrect Sign in Permalink Once again, Hollywood has displayed special effects that are greater than the film itself. No classic film here, but one that is definitely worth an afternoon at the pictures. The cinematography is superb. The scenes swinging from building to building is challenging to the imagination. Great show for the youngsters.
3.0~not the perfect comic book hero movie xanadu-16 Sign in Permalink You want Spiderman, this is not Spiderman mythology, it's all wrong, where's Gwen, why take Mary Jane instead? Good series of mistakes all along the whole trilogy and maybe these are truly block busters but true comic book readers can't accept this. Personally i dislike it and well, even the bad effects (during the first part of the movie) are part of it. Maybe errors happen but if you want to see a perfect comic book movie go watch Sin City or 300, this is not Spiderman. Same thing i could say about way to re-script th3 comic book mythology with all that happened with the clone saga or the end of marriage thank to a bunch of so called writers to reboot the franchise on written stripes. Baddest of all bad ideas. Enough with Kraven's family enough with deaths in the family "escamotage". Maybe i'm just one of the few thinking like this but here's my two cents about.
9.0~views from a comic fan angelusthorn Sign in Permalink Having personaly seen every comic book movie ever made I can easily say that this is the best by far. With only minor fluxes of the original story the film offers a wide range of emotional moments from tears to cheers, truly a wonderful achievement.
9.0~"My Spider Sense is Tingling" and It's Telling Me This Is One Of The Best Comic Book Movies Ever. MissCzarChasm Sign in Permalink Marvel superheroes are hitting the big screen in waves. First there was blade which made a decent amount at the box office with its 70 + million dollar performance. 2000 brought us X-Men which became a box office hit when it opened with 54 million that summer. The sequel is on its way in 2003. Blade 2 was released in March and it opened with 33 million, an improvement from the 17-18 million the first one opened with. Thr Hulk is now in production with Eric Bana playing the Hulk and Oscar winner, Jennifer Connelly also starring. That film is directed by Ang Lee. After that Daredevil is set to be released and that film stars Ben Affleck, as Daredevil and Jennifer Gardner of Alias also starring. Until then however, we have Spider-Man and judging by the early weekend numbers(114 million opening weekend-highest opening of all time) it seems that people are loving this film. I can say that I more than loved it. I thought it was great. Tobey Maguire takes on the role as Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man, a product of being bitten by a mutant spider while on a school field trip. He is in love with the girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Dunst; Bring it On) who is a kind sole but barely notices him. Peter lives with his Aunt May (Harris) and Uncle Ben (Robertson)(fans, like myself, of the comic will know why he's in this living situation). At first Parker is confused by his new skills but soon he begins to use them to his advantage. Parker uses his new skills to fight in a wrestling match to get money for various things, one being a way to impress Mary Jane. After the match however tragedy strikes and Parker fully realizes that "With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility" and through this "Spider-Man" is born. Spidey's nemesis in the round is Norman Osborne (Dafoe; Shadow of the Vampire), a somewhat mad/determined scientist who needs to prove that his experiments work. After testing them on himself, something goes wrong and the Green Goblin is born. I was quite surprised how much Tobey Maguire filled into the role; he not only makes it his own but manages to give it a little character behind the mask. He has that innocent, everyday man quality about him that makes you believe in him. It's a performance that has much more depth than you would expect, especially from a comic book movie. The supporting cast takes a back seat to Spider-Man, lavish sets and ultimately some nice special effects, but they get the job done. Willem Dafoe has gotten back into my good graces after the atrocious Speed 2. He does a good job as the Green Goblin and doesn't overdo it. Now, it's not as memorable or great as Nicholson's Joker, but he makes a formable foe to Spider-Man. What I liked about his performance was that he didn't over-shadow the hero, much like the Joker did in Batman. Dafoe is given the right amount of screentime to establish his character but not too much to the point where it becomes a movie about him rather than Peter/Spider-Man The other two notable cast mates are Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. Franco had actually gone in to the audition for the role of Peter Parker but ended up playing Harry Osborne, the villain's son. I liked Franco as Peter Parker's roommate and best friend and love the idea of the continuity aspect of the plot.(You'll see when you view the film) Kirsten Dunst is even a good casting choice. What could've easily been an eye-candy role is taken to another level. She's very likable in the role and her chemistry with Maguire is natural and not forced. This is good transition into the screenwriting by one of my favorites, David Koepp, who was the master behind films like Stir of Echoes and Panic Room. He brings Spider-Man to life with the help of Maguire and director Sam Raimi (A Simple Plan). The plot even over-shadows the great CGI in my opinion. The storyline is slightly more developed than most movies of this nature and is driven by its characters. I liked that aspect of the film very much. Spider-Man also features some funny moments like a cameo by Bruce Campbell (of Evil Dead fame) as a Vince McMahon type ring master who gave Parker the name of "The Amazing Spider-Man" and Peter Parker having fun swinging from building to building. The J Jonah Jameson character is also very funny. He makes the transition from comic to screen very well. Dead on representation. Spider-Man is the ultimate comic book movie that not only looks like it came from the comics, but adds in the sounds and some dialogue. From the opening credits to the last shot, you could see it in an issue of "Spider-Man". Like X-Men, the film is bright with colorful characters and big time action scenes. It reaches the level of my favorite comic book movie, Batman, and maybe after more viewings it could surpass it. Overall, Spider-Man is a fun romp of comic book action. With a great story, acting, special effects, and a lot of heart Spider-Man is a perfect start to the summer season and i'm glad it's leading the pack.
10.0~Tee-hee! snoozy27 Sign in Permalink Wow! What else can I say? Not a dull moment in this film, folks. Excellent casting, that's for sure... although Aunt May is kind of creepy... I must say that this is the best comic book adaptation I've ever seen. Keep up the great work, Sam Raimi!
7.0~Oh... they made a comic-book movie... DamRho Sign in Permalink This could have been it... it should have been the best comic-book adaptation to film ever. But it isn't. Why? Because it's a comic-book movie. I thought that when you put together such a high budget and expectations on a movie you should be obliged to, at least, do something really great. Sam Raimi didn't achieve what he should have achieved. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad movie, it just isn't likely to make you believe that Spider-Man could be real. X-Men makes us believe that, Batman (the first two, that is) makes us believe that. Spider-Man doesn't. The CG character is only average quality for nowaday's standards and the acting is pretty basic. The plot seems to take a leap sometimes with no understandable reason and they have altered the comic-books so much that it hurts. If you want to make a comic-book movie you MUST obey the comic-book's rules. They made Peter Parker a wimp. They made him Clark Kent. I am a fan of the Spider-Man comic books and I am disappointed with this movie. It could have been so much better. I hope Sam Raimi does read the books before he finished Spider-Man 2 and not just pretend he has been a fan all his life.
8.0~it's get better as time and viewings go on Quinoa1984 Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi to me didn't seem like not the wrong choice to direct Spiderman but the un-needed choice- at least at first. The screenplay would've fit any director whose a fan of Spiderman since it entails most of the clichés and knowledge that goes into a comic book adaptation. But after repeat viewings, and seeing Spider-Man 2 more as well, I've grown some more respect for a picture that I thought of at first as being as nothing more than something of Raimi going 'mega Hollywood' in telling the origin of Peter Parker. In this first installment, he fights the Green Goblin played by Willem Dafoe in a dual personality type role with Norman Osborne. Watching the movie, I liked the set up parts and the connection between Maguire and Dunst is there, but on the outset when I saw it early on I was not so much a fan of the action sequences, which compared to Raimi's grittier (and funnier to be sure) Evil Dead movies, are so fabricated they might as well have credited Pixar as one of the production companies. The work though shows a little better once settled further into the Parker saga, and the real skills come through better. And compared to others that have come out in more recent years, it is exciting in ways other action set pieces from other comic book movies aren't. I even dig the performances more too, especially Willem Dafoe as Osbourne/Green Goblin, who puts as much gnarly relish into his performance that it ranks up there with his best work. Maybe part of it too is accepting Maguire as Parker/Spiderman, as he has an awkwardness early on that's uncanny. But it fits, and it perhaps grows in the sequel(s), and seeing it again I appreciate what he's doing in the character. In short, it's fun, and that's all we can really ask for. B+
10.0~It turned me into a web-head scardyg Sign in Permalink This movie is fun, dramatic, and well acted. I came in to the theater having never seen or read anything Spider-man in my life. I found Tobey McGuire's performance as Peter Parker surprisingly enjoyable, the Green Goblin actually made me scream in the theater at one point (to the hilarity of the other members of the audience), and my sister and I at the jaded age of fifteen and fourteen found ourselves running around yelling "thwipp!" "thwipp!" for months afterward. This movie is just fun. It never skimps on acting, character development, or story. It got us into comics, superheroes, and opened up many doors I never expected at the time. So stop complaining about the Power Rangers Goblin mask. I mean come on? Were they supposed to throw a purple link hat and some green makeup on Defoe?
1.0~Worst Spider-Man hluloff Sign in Permalink He is to old and buff why is he in high school at that age
1.0~Seemed to easy bigben5 Sign in Permalink WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS . For those who've already seen the movie, read on. I think there's something lacking whenever a comic book is converted into a movie, and that is the presence of smart villans AND heros. Personally, I think the transformation of Peter Parker into Spiderman was too easy. One minute I'm a weak, emaciated, like hamster cowering in the corner of my cage getting picked on, and the next minute I'm kicking your ass and liking it too. The transformation from wimp to hero seems to lack character growth. The producers decision to have Spidey have web shoot out of his glands instead of a gadget he makes, for the sake of saving all the smartsy stuff, also does damage to Spidey's character. In the comic books and cartoons, Spiderman is known to experiment, invent and even investigate. With him working at the Daily Bugle (or is that superman) don't you think he could - out of curiousity - do some research and find out who Green Goblin is? By the way, I think Tobey Maguire looks nerdish even after his transformation into Spiderman. And another thing, since most people know the story of Spiderman why not start in medias res and have him flash back to the time of the spider bite. That way, it would've saved a heck of a lot of time. Now to move on to Mary Jane, they only meet up and chat one-one-one about 4 times in the movie and all of a sudden when the movie ends she's in love with Peter Parker. Why does love always seem like magic in movies? Figuring out he was Spiderman by a kiss was also lame. She always seems to get in trouble too. Who would want that kind of a girl? The Green Goblin was dumb. They never went into detail as to why he chooses a goblin mask. The part when Spiderman is paralyzed, why didn't he just take off Spidey's mask and kill him on the spot if he said "no" to his proposal. And why do all villans ask the good guys to join them? Finding out Spidey's identity by a cut was also too coincidental. Isn't the scene where the Goblin pretends to be a women screaming in the fire, painfully obvious? The part where Norman Osborne is talking to the Goblin mask is hilarious! "What should I do " says Osborne "A good warrior, attacks neither body or mind". "Then what should I do?" "Attack the heart, Osborne ! The heart!" The end where the Goblin gets killed by his own glider was stupid. Didn't he know that Spiderman has a spider- sense and isn't a comment like "God's be with you" a dead give away? Also, I can't keep getting over how Harry Osborne could not have known his dad was the Goblin, after all, hasn't he been acting weird lately? In short, I didn't think there was enough action to make it an action movie. Spiderman took thugs down too easily. It would've nice to see scenes of slapstick with Spidey webing a guy and repeatedly hitting him in the face, kinda like a yo-yo effect. The web slinging was great. That was the only plus.
10.0~Best spider-man movie to date next to spider-man 2 joebrennan-55027 Sign in Permalink This movie is the best spider-man movie and everyone casted in this movie just got it right with jk Simmons as j jonah jameson and willem dafoe as green goblin / Norman Osborn is fantastic also James Franco as harry and as much i like tom Holland as spider-man I don't think no one will ever beat Toby Maguire as spider-man Sam raimi knew what he was doing because he was a major fan of spider-man so he knows what he was doing when he directed oh and Danny elfmans soundtrack is beautiful and the final fight scene will always be my faviourite fight scene of any superhero movie
1.0~Incredibly disappointing. cd_spring Sign in Permalink As a huge Sam Rami fan I wanted to like this movie, but I found it to be tediously predictable and poorly written. The characters were portrayed with such lack luster performances that I hope the franchise switches leading men and love interests as much as the Batman series. Even the visual effects failed to wow me (and were quite poor in many places). This movie might be a big bang right now, but I suspect that is more caused by the horrible movies that have preceded it this year. My wife summed this movie up when she called it "Gumby versus the Evil Power Ranger". The CG Spiderman was more like Rubberman and the Green Goblin (both CG and Willem Dafoe) looked like he really belonged in an episode of the Power Rangers. The writing also took its cues from these two shows. One half corny jokes and silly gags and the other half being chessy cornball stuff that 5 years olds find funny but adults simply find inane. The acting was atrocious. While I wish this film would mark the end of the careers of the untalented duo of Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, I suspect I will be tortured by these two hacks for many years to come. Willem Dafoe should stop acting all together. He had one great role and simply diminishes it every time he appears in another role. I knew that this movie was going to be devoid of good acting when Sam actually hired Cliff Robertson. The only performance I enjoyed was the five minutes of Rami veteran, Bruce Campbell. His screen time was the only thing I liked in this whole movie. The visual effects looked like Batman and Robin (which is not a compliment). John Dykstra needs to go back to flying spaceships and blowing up minatures. He has no talent for character animation. I was immensely disappointed with the whole look of the CG elements. The lighting was horrible and the composites rarely worked. In general, I am tired of the whole over exposed grainy look that so many of the recent visual effects heavy films are employing. I marvel at how rich and vibrant the colors are in all of the Star Wars and Indiana Jones films and how rarely we see that same look in films of that same genre. This film is aimed at kids under the age of 10 (and adults who wish to harken back to a time when they were incapable of smelling a rotten egg). I would take my kids to see it because it does have a strong moral sense (sort of) and lacks the violence of usual action films, but then I would duck out to see Star Wars instead. I weep for the future of this industry if this is the kind of drivel that appeals to the public right now. Clearly the age of the popular and "good" movie may be coming to an end. If I wasn't excited about Attack of the Clones, I can't wait now. I need something to clear the nasty taste that "Spider-man" has left in my mouth.
9.0~The Amazing Heroics of Peter Parker Bogmeister Sign in Permalink It's amazing that now, only 3 years after it first opened, Spider-Man the movie has already reached legendary status. But, it's not really a surprise, because the film utilized all the legendary aspects of the comic book character as presented since 1962. It's also amazing that I'm old enough to have started reading his adventures in the late sixties, when he was a relatively new super-hero. He was already famous by then, however, as the mythical qualities of the hero who sacrifices all his personal comforts for the good of humanity had propelled him to the forefront of modern super-heroics. This quality is very evident in the film's story thrust. It seems as if the entire world is against Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire). Even when he first dons a mask to enter a wrestling match and no one in the vast audience there knows who he is, they're all shouting for his downfall. Even his uncle (Robertson), one of the only 2 people in the world on his side, seems to turn against him just before he's killed, though that's more a function of Parker's immaturity. Someone in Parker's place could (and should) very easily turn into a major villain with a major chip on his shoulder. One could argue it's easy to become a hero if you have a billion dollars (Batman) or be invulnerable to harm (Superman). Parker has nothing and he bleeds profusely in this film. None of this deters him - he is so focused on his mission, a life mission which has him looking forward to a lonely and painful journey for year after year. It's also painful to see the unrequited love for Mary Jane (Dunst). MJ in this version is a combination of both the Mary Jane & Gwen Stacy characters of the books. Rightly so, as the flip MJ of the sixties wouldn't have been a good love interest. The bottom line is do we care when the villain drops her to her possible death near the end (an eerie recreation of the most tragic instance in the books). Sure we do; she's the hero's girl, she deserves happiness (she does have a miserable existence, to some extent). All the other characters are well-drawn, as well. Harry (Franco) craves his father's respect; Aunt May (Forsythe) struggles with various pains associated with one's twilight years; even Osborne (Dafoe), who is merely driven insane by an experiment - he twitches in megalomania and is truly creepy. Then there's Jameson (Simmons), transposed faithfully from the 4-color pages - he's a caricature, sure, but that's what happens to someone who wraps himself in his work. They become the work; selling papers - printing ink is in his blood. Would this film have been as successful if not faithful to the character? I'm not sure, but it's hard to imagine a 2nd weekend of $70 million in that scenario. The filmmakers, director Raimi in particular, stuck to the core of Spider-Man. The one big deviation, his organic webbing, was just another intelligent decision (a high school kid developing a product beyond all the high tech companies? uh-uh). It even served as a metaphor for Parker's teen-age development. A funny thing about Maguire, too. A few months before the picture opened, I saw his likeness on the poster of another film and I thought immediately - that is Peter Parker!
8.0~Really good comic-book adventure Captain Ed Sign in Permalink I've just some from the theater and I have to say, the movie had me pumped. Let's face it -- Superman may be well-nigh invincible, and Batman was richer than God, but Spidey was the superhero we all wished we could be. Peter Parker was one of US. That sense is well presented in the film; Tobey Maguire is excellent, and hopefully he will be reprising the role in the future. In fact, there isn't a bad performance in the film. Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst (with a bad dye job), and Cliff Robertson and the rest of the cast do a great job. ** SPOILERS ** However, there are some drawbacks. This is most definitely a formula film; some of the reviewers mention the parallels to Superman, especially Cliff Robertson/Glenn Ford, but there are also parallels to Batman, such as the parent(s)' murder prompting the crime-fighting. The problem is that we can all see these clichés coming a mile away. When the movie tries new material, such as the wrestling match and his first costume (hilarious!), it works so much better. Especially good was Spidey's realization that his spiteful inaction was directly responsible for a tragic event. On the other hand, I don't know why every one of these films has to include at least one dark-alley butt kicking, and Spider-Man has more than one. Can't we get one in a mall once in a while? Or doesn't crime strike the suburbs? At least this movie was shot in a real city, instead of a Tim Burton monstrosity -- a very nice touch, since Spidey was always more about reality than Batman or Superman. The special effects are great, and in fact may be a little TOO good. Our hero begins to look and move more like a video game -- a really GOOD video game, but it still looks fake. Other than that small quibble, the money they spent was well used. Overall, a great popcorn movie and it certainly will fulfill moviegoer's expectations. Maybe this one will make enough money so that the sequel can do better at moving past the clichés. My vote is an 8 out of ten. Spidey rules!
9.0~Spider-Man Forever denil-kisten Sign in Permalink I love Spider-Man, he is my favorite superhero. This movie does justice to the character. The pacing, the acting, the characters, the story are follow the comic books well. We have an average teenage nerd who turns to the amazing spider-man. And that was done well. The chemistry between Mary Jane and Peter also came out well. The introduction to our villain was just great. The amazing spider-man will never be as good as this one. Sam Raimi's version will always be the best. Spider-Man Forever. Toby Maguire's Spider-Man will always be better than any other spider-man actors. He plays the nerdish Peter Parker perfectly. William Dafoe's green goblin persona was incredible.9/10 In fact, I think this movie wouldn't have been the same if not for him. And the way Sam brought out the character... All I can say is that everyone did a great job and they should be proud of it.
8.0~A great start to the franchise. BA_Harrison Sign in Permalink Having already proved himself more than capable of creating a fun comic-book style movie with Darkman (1990), Sam Raimi finally had a crack at the real thing in 2002 with Marvel's Spiderman—and he did a remarkably good job, delivering a slick, action-packed, major-studio, summer blockbuster that genuinely feels like a superhero comic-strip brought to life, with colourful cinematography, perfectly nuanced performances and the director's playful visual style very much in evidence (as opposed to those dreary Nolan Batman films that take matters far too seriously). Starring Tobey Maguire as the titular web-slinger, Spiderman is an 'origins' movie, and as such takes a while to get the slam-bang action, but the characters are so well defined and the script (by David Koepp) so smartly written that boredom is never an issue. I've never been much of a fan of comic book movies that dwell too heavily on the whole 'tortured soul' aspect of their central character (as in Nolan's miserable Batman films), and with Spiderman being one of Marvel's classic 'emotionally troubled' heroes, there was serious potential for this to be a rather joyless affair. Thankfully, Raimi handles the personal trauma in such a manner that it never drags the enjoyment factor down. This is pure entertainment all the way—a real corker of a superhero film that still has the power to wow well over a decade after its original release.
7.0~Pretty good mjuice Sign in Permalink Spider-Man was an enjoyable light summer move, and was pretty good all around ... the acting was pretty good.. the effects were pretty good.. the story was pretty good. Nothing really popped out about it as great though -- even the best scenes in the movie were barely memorable in the long run. There's one hot kissing scene, one good fight scene, and about two vaguely memorable funny scenes. I recommend seeing it.. it's fun, just don't think you're going to be seeing a classic.
10.0~Great movie, renewed my faith in comic book translations to film! Lena-n-Joey Sign in Permalink Definitely one of the best I've seen in awhile, probably since X-Men. I think Toby Maguire was a GREAT Peter Parker/Spiderman (Sorry if that's a spoiler, kids, if you didn't know Parker was Spiderman before the movie, go buy a comic or three =), and while Kirsten Dunst isn't my favorite actress by a long shot, she fit with Mary Jane's profile very well. I have to admit out of all the comic books, Spiderman was the one I knew the least about, still do. However, even for a Spiderman-Stupid person as myself, I was able to quickly fill the gaps of what I knew and what was going on just by watching the film. I think the camera work was fantastic. Having Willem Dafoe argue with himself using the mirror was a nice touch of cinematography. Maguire managed to deliver the classic "Silly-Spidey" lines with just the right intonation and effect. Showing how he was CONSTANTLY looking for work and money to support himself whilst NOT saving MJ gives the story a lot more realism than Batman (Of course Bruce Wayne was filthy rich) or Superman (who, though he worked, didn't seem to really need the money). As for the scenes that show things EVERYone knows about Spiderman - I found myself cringing, wishing Peter Parker would move when the spider was going to bite him. I found myself wincing when I saw Norman Osborn becoming the Green Goblin in the lab. Overall, this by far gives me a new hope for comic book or even video game to film translations. Keep up the consistency for Spiderman II! 10/10, two thumbs up, good work!
8.0~Thought provoking and entertaining superhero fantasy Stampsfightclub Sign in Permalink This adaptation of the Marvel comic about an ordinary guy being turned into a spider brings out some wonderful stories, a great tale of the human spirit in Sam Raimi's 2002 box office hit. Tobey McGuire (Seabiscuit) stars as high school student Peter Parker who gets bitten by a super spider on a class trip and with issues regarding the love of his life, school and his family, Parker's life is changing dramatically. Having never read any of the comics but seeing the odd cartoon episode on the TV I wasn't quite sure what I was expecting when I first rented this film out but it was a very pleasing watch, filled with action suspense and a good plot for the whole family to enjoy. McGuire fits the role of the stereotypical teen brilliantly. He plays the role quietly and through the narration we get a sense of his true feelings. I wasn't a fan of this technique but it was good to get more depth to the intriguing character as he goes through very difficult and interesting changes. Dunst (Interview with the Vampire) plays Parker's love interest Mary Jane. There is good chemistry between the two actors and although the dialogue is cheesy and predictable, it is kinda sweet. The infamous upside down kiss was very well directed and probably the best on screen kiss I've seen. Willem Dafoe (Shadow of the vampire) is excellent as Norman Osborne, perhaps the best performance of the film. His portray of good and evil makes his performance varied and intriguing. The mirror scene was a brilliant acting moment to emphasise the contrasts. The plot is fairly consistent. The drama behind scenarios involving Uncle Ben and the change into Spiderman are brilliant whereas some of the teenage school scenes are conventional, predictable especially the opening scene on the bus. The direction and special effects are great and the whole ideology of the hero is brilliant making it an enjoyable and thought provoking superhero fantasy.
8.0~Spiderman, a movie I can easily relate to robert-710-767167 Sign in Permalink What a great movie! There was so much adventure, so much story, so much emotion, and so much to relate to! The main character is a socially rejected, nerdy kid. Same with me. The kid ends up with super powers (that spider man has, hence the title of the movie) and uses it to show off to a girl who he (according to the movie) has had a crush on since he was 8-10 or so. The girl is actually quite a good choice. Not a cheesy blond or something nasty, just a nice pretty red haired girl. Perfect for the social rejects. I really enjoyed the story as well. It was very emotional during the Uncle's death, as well as the Aunt in the hospital. I really liked the "love" scene between the main character and the girl. I also liked the competition feel during the movie where the reject wanted to impress the girl but the other guy, who was still a nice friend, was doing so already. I guess as a 17 year old it's just easy to relate to it. Of course who could forget the action, the excitement and intensity while spider man faced his many villains! Rated 8/10, mostly because of some mild swearing.
1.0~Maybe they should make a superhero who has the ability to make a good movie Agent10 Sign in Permalink -contains spoilers- Wow! What a waste of money, talent and film stock. Many elements have to fall into place for me to completely hate a movie to the point where I feel like setting the movie theater on fire. Where to begin. Before the bashing begins, I will say Tobey Maguire was very believable as Peter Parker. Hhmm, that seems to be the only thing I can say that isn't snide or cutting. First off, Hollywood should now realize this whole "replace-the-human-with-CGI-effects" idea just doesn't work. It didn't work in Blade 2, and it certainly did not work in this film. Maybe imagination or blue screen acting would be more appropriate than trying to replace the human form with fake and awkward images of light and bit maps. It was like a bad video game. The dialogue also felt forced in many areas, especially when Parker tried to reveal his true feelings for Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). They did it twice, and it still didn't work! David Koepp went from writing Panic Room to this slop! I haven't seen a dive like that since a Don King promoted fight. Typically, I rarely put down music, but then again, I think its time for Danny Elfman to go on some reunion tour with Kajagoogoo or whatever the heck the name of that band was he played for. Its obvious he has lost his touch. In fact, this entire movie wreaks of Batman, which was a far superior movie. The music was a blatant rip-off of Batman, and the movie even tried to rehash certain elements and moments. Let's see here: a chemical turns Willem Dafoe into a maniac, Dafoe's character trying to be nice to the superhero at the end before trying to kill the hero, the scene where the editor calls all of Parker's photos "crap" (which was exactly the same way Batman did it), the Green Goblin killing a group of people who want to rub him out of the picture (like the Joker and the other mobsters), etc. The similarities are far too numerous to number, the only difference is that Batman actually had some flair and magistry. This was nothing but a high, gloss picture with pretty images and mind-numbing editing techniques. I should have stayed away considering Sam Raimi had directed this film, but for some odd reason, I decided to follow the crowd. The lesson: be yourself and watch something else.
10.0~True to the story (which makes it so good). rodlew17 Sign in Permalink Unlike many super-hero movies, Spider-man actually stays true to the story. That is what makes this movie so good. It has not been "Hollywood-ized" by only having big screen names to bring people to the theater (like all the sequels to Batman). Instead, this movie is built upon a good story (which all the best movies have). I feel it is the best super-hero movie of all time.
9.0~* * * 1/2 nickandstef Sign in Permalink * * * 1/2 out of * * * * stars. A fantastic film that rivals that of Batman and Superman. One of 2002's best and shows the everyman trying to be a superhero. Classic hero comes to the bigscreen complete with a fantastic cast, great filmakers and the budget to bring Spidey swinging onto the silver screen.
4.0~Boring!! r-verkerk Sign in Permalink Being a comic-book fan since childhood this movie was on my must-see list. What a disappointment it was however! Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are totally mis-casted as P.P. and M.J. The tone of the movie is not like the comic books whatsoever. I loved Spiderman for his great one-liners and mocking of his adversaries when he fought them. None of that came back in the movie. In stead a way too long explanation of P.P. dealing with his new powers. The costume of the Green Goblin looked as if it came out of the Power Rangers costume set. Special effects are terrible. I was really glad when the movie ended. I almost fell asleep. What I liked was the J. Jonah Jameson character and Spideys costume. This is not the best movie I have ever seen and I hope Sam Raimi doesn't get to direct the sequel. Maybe the producers should take a look at the guys that directed X-Men and Blade. These movies are way better than this boring waste of film. Other good adaptations are IMHO Darkman, the Shadow and even Rocketeer!

8.0~Not enough Raimi ilobko Sign in Permalink Yesterday saw Spiderman movie and it left me very dissapointed.Sam Raimi was always my favourite director, but this movie is way too american for european tastes - parents of Spidey are dying desperately, tears are falling from their faces like rain from the sky, where american flag is waving. I know, i know, its good to be a patriot, to love your family, but why show it in an action movie in such a hard dose. There were some nice moments (famous camerawork included), but the whole thing is not gaining even Darkman's (old Raimi's work)level of quality. So watch Sam's previous movies instead of this one. Evil Dead is a first to watch!
10.0~Essential - electrifying action best MARVEL superhero origin story my second personal favorite Spider-Man superhero comic-book flick NightmareOnElmStreetFan Sign in Permalink One of the most decent electrifying essential superhero's, the best origin story about a superhero Spider-Man - my personal favorite comic book superhero action movie. Spider-Man (2002) become a blockbuster hit in 2002 when it come out. Spider-Man is my favorite superhero. I known Spider-Man character superhero from animated TV series of the 90's. As a teeneger I saw music video Hero by Chad Kroeger featuring Josey Scott and I rushed to see this movie right away. A neighbor friend got me the movie on his comp and it was an adrenaline rush. This movie become my favorite superhero film of all time it still is. It defines my childhood. I watch this movie the first time as a teenager in a high school, it is a teenager dream. Spider-Man takes cues from Superman: The Movie (1978) which deals about superhero Clark Kent how he become Superman. Here is the origin story of how Peter Parker become from a shy nerdy teenager later photographer to a ultimate superhero of all time his alter ego Spider-Man. Just like Richard Donner directed the first Superman the excitement is here from MARVEL screenplay David Koepp created by Stan Lee R.I.P and Steve Ditko. I used to had VHS tape my mom bought me a present this movie, when I was a teen for my gradation day. I used too had the poster, but I don't know where that poster went too. I love this film to death my number 1 favorite Spider-Man film is Spider-Man: Homecoming but this Spider-Man the first in the trilogy is my second personal favorite Spidey film. I enjoy beautiful music score for Spider-Man from Danny Elfman, who also worked on a 1989 Batman music score. I love that music score to death. Directed was by Sam Raimi from "The Evil Dead" trilogy and stars: Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. The first film has humor, fast pacing, a lot of action, good sci-fi effects beautiful cast, good likable leads and good FX special effects. I love the CGI effects and custom for Spider-Man and Green Goblin. I heard that thieves stole Spider-Man suits on the production set that the crew make them for this movie. Mostly I understand the character Peter Parker it has deep sense meaning to the character. The first half deals more about how Peter is learning about his super ability when he gets bit by a genetically engineered "super spider". First he wants to impressed his neighbor Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) the eternity love of his life by buying a car and he goes in to wrestling match to earn money. First half he was more selfish, shy and geek and he lost by a car jacking his uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and when he didn't safe that carjacker who killed his uncle he was selfish. But he got redemption later in the movie and he learns that is not what he does. Spider-Man saved more kids than The Amazing Spider-Man Andrew Garfield did. Spider-Man saves Marry Jane. He saves a baby from a burning building. Spider-Man saves a trolley car on the Roosevelt Bridge witch are kids in it. On a parade in which Green Goblin starts attacking Spider-Man saves a kid when a balloon is falling at him, almost crushing him. You have action sequences in which Green Goblin on jet glider fires on Spider-Man rockets, and bullets, slugs at him but misses. He throws pumpkin bombs on the Board of Directors killing them, he throws razor bats on Spider-Man and cuts him. I love the fight sequence between Spider-Man and Green Goblin I love that on the end. Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker / Spider-Man did a good excellent job playing his character. I like the actor he was excellent I really love his performance. Spider-Man was really the first film in the trilogy I saw. Kirsten Dunst was the best of the film as Mary Jane Watson. I love Kirsten she was my teen crush I loved her in Bring It On, The Crow: Salvation, Get Over It and The Virgin Suicides. I really, really miss the actress I grew up watching in Jumanji the actress, she was part of me growing up. James Franco as Harry Osborn was good I like the actor in a comedy Whatever It Takes he was good as Harry Osburn and a friend of Peter Parker. Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn is a kick-ass actor he plays so many good roles that I enjoy. I love him in Platoon as Sergeant Elias, White Sands and John Wick he played John Wick's friend Marcus. So I love the guy I love his portrayal. Some Spider-Man fanboy told me that Spider-Man was stalking Mary Jane, it wasn't true. He saw Mary Jane running on the dark streets alone and he saw a muggers following her, so he went after her to help her out and rescuing her, he wasn't stalking her. She was his crush but he wasn't stalking her. In my opinion it is a decent electrifying essential action film of one of the best origin story's of a superhero becoming a Spider-Man. But I am hug fan of Tom Holland's Spider-Man: Homecoming so this Spider-Man is my second personal favorite film in the "Spider-Man" franchise that come out of all five films.
7.0~Hanging With The Big Boys dunmore_ego Sign in Permalink From the web-woven opening credits to the last strains of the cartoon theme as the copyrights roll, Spiderman joins the pantheon of underpanted heroes whom the movie forum has portrayed as mightily as their bulging quadriceps (at this movie's release date, that being only Superman and Batman - the OG's). Directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, James Franco and Kirsten Dunst's Breasts. Spiderman's new movie franchise ambassador had to win over audiences in his first 5 minutes screen time, or go the way of Leno-chinned Nicholas Hammond, the vacuous, Gilligan-hairdo nerd of the late-70s TV series, The Amazing Spiderman, which was as exciting as swallowing chalk. Tobey Maguire, running after his bus, browbeaten by schoolmates, lamenting in voice-over his teen-age problems, was a winner right outa the gate! An exhilarating feature of this film was the web-swinging (non-existent in the soporific Amazing Spiderman TV series, due to its technical difficulty). Movie technology has lent literal wings to stunts and visuals which were impossible in the days of Adam West running around with a Wile E. Coyote bomb over his head, or Reb Brown decimating the legend of Captain America throughout that whole ineffectual DOINK of a movie. Truly this is the correct era to begin making films of 'super' heroes, for only now can movie-makers convey a 'superiority' that George Reeves could never achieve by lying on a table and being chroma-keyed onto a swishing sky-scape. Aficionados may lament that there *is* a CGI jerkiness to the man-spider's swinging - but this nonhuman factor somehow only enhances the arachnoid element in this 'spider'-man. It's a letdown, yes, knowing that Tobey is not even on screen when Spiderman is barreling along, but it's better than watching 'crooks' with pencil-mustaches shooting at George Reeves with their hats on, while he poses arms-akimbo-legs-apart, then crushes their guns like the movie-clay models they are ('one-trick-pony' in the dictionary, there's a picture of George Reeves as Superman). In the 60's comics, Parker was bitten by a 'radioactive' spider  this was updated to 'genetically-mutated' spider, reflecting each era's fears and misunderstandings. The decision to have Spiderman internally generate his webbing seems more rational now, than his creation of web-cartridges in the 60's. It always intrigued me why Stan Lee (Spiderman's creator) balked at the webbing aspect, giving his young hero super-strength, an inexplicable 'spider-sense' and even the power to walk up walls (which should not be possible; stickiness of appendages is irrelevant, but rather volume-to-surface-area ratio allows insects this ability), yet no endemic webbing  a spider's trademark. (Spiders 'spin' their web via spinnerets located anally, so did Lee consider this and veto it?  and I suppose any superhero generating web from a butt-spinneret would lose most of the popcorn vote.) Who better to play Spiderman's greatest arch-nemesis, the Green Goblin, than Willem Dafoe? Face carved from crazy and body ripped like Jesus in crucifixion pose, Willem OWNED this role. The kiddies might have relished Norman the Goblin in his techno armor suit (a deviation from the comics, though definitely an improvement on the purple and green sexually-indecisive Halloween attire), but my favorite scenes were Willem battling the Goblin Within; when he was simply - like John Malkovich  Being Willem Dafoe. James Franco, as Dafoe's barely-tangible son and Peter Parker's almost-incorporeal pal, Harry Osborn, phoned in his role on a cellphone that kept cutting out. In the comic world, Harry wildly grabs the party reins when his father dies at Spiderman's hands, and becomes the second Green Goblin. By movie's end, Franco - in a valiant attempt to become three-dimensional - vows to make Spiderman pay for killing his dad, but I don't think any of us can visualize the fey Franco carrying the torch of Divine Wicked that came so rapturously naturally to Willem. Probably the biggest crime this wisp of smoke could perpetrate would be to join a boy-band and pretend to be The Hard One. Can anyone deny the integral role played by Kirsten Dunst's Breasts?; ubiquitous, delinquitous, nasty-perky, herky-jerky, firm yet forgiving, relentlessly real, cruel but fair. Remember, dears: when walking home from work, *always take the darkest alleyways and wear no bra*. Flame-red locks, sotto voce delivery, camera unable to focus on anything BUT those mounds of necessity, those pillows of slavery. Spiderperve has the advantage that most of us who wear dark glasses indoors gainfully employ: behind that mask, we KNOW what he's looking' at! After impressing her by kicking white-rapper butt, he hangs upside-down passively, allowing her to ease his mask off his mouth, in the same manner she would ease dark-nylon stocking from betwixt milky thigh, rain streaming down his roundish head, delineating her pinkish curves, as they lock lips in a tongue-roving, erotogenic, nerve-jangling, storm-driven kiss, rivaling easily the heat of Scarlett & Rhett in Gone With The Wind, or Rourke & Basinger in Nine ½ Weeks, and even Christopher Reeve and Michael Caine in Deathtrap. The subliminal metaphor was not lost on this disciple of heady foreplay: Fear, Sweat, Violence, Surrender. And all of it  WET. The Human Procreation Arc. Like the movie's slipshod ending, I have to wrap this essay suddenly (I've reached my word-limit, as Raimi probably reached his budget-limit). Kirsten Dunst's Breasts suddenly profess an irrationally-deduced 'love' for Parker, which is an essay unto itself, outlining the needless 'hope' this would instill in geeks who bag their comics who are NOT secretly superheroes: perpetuating the fantasy that a Pasty-Boy can Make Good if his Love is Real  well, boys, you'd better pray that somewhere out there, there's a radioactive ferret with your butt-cheeks' name on his teeth.

3.0~Makes Toy Story look live action mferraro Sign in Permalink Before I get to the disection of this movie, I must begin with the background of course. When I was young, Spiderman comics were the best. I used to read it all the time. When I heard Sam Raimi and Spiderman, I thought it would be nothing shy of greatness. The Evil Dead series, Darkman, the Gift, and a Simple Plan have all been great. He has had his strikes (For Love of the Game and Quick and the Dead), but so has pretty much every director. Onward with the review. I know a friend who works at a theater so I had my own private showing. At about 12:00 am, the event began. A little over two hours later, I was horrified. The Good: For one, the story was really good. Take note I said "story". Another huge plus was the cameo of all cameos by the immortal Bruce Campbell. Where is his supporting actor nom? Two thumbs up Bruce. Now, without too many spoilers, the Bad: Where should I start? Hmm. Ok. First off, when Pete starts using his powers, he climbs up a building and runs across rooftops jumping. Let me just say, when he is running across the rooftop the effects were so AWFUL that it looked like Woody from Toy Story was doing the stunt work. After that, it was all down hill. The world of cinema must learn: At least attempt to make it look real. But why would they have to with a $114 million dollar opening. And if you can't make look real, try a different attmept. Usually with bad CG, you can ignore it. Not in this film. This movie made Blade 2 (another awful example of CG from hell) look like the Matrix. Now, remember when I said it had a good story? Please, do not confuse that with the dialog. The dialog between Parker and MJ was so awkwardly aweful, it actually made me feel awkward. It was terrible. I know that the comic had better dialog. If they did, why would you read it? Hmm. David Koepp is the man, but not with this web of filth. Now to the finish. Green Goblin. Not so much the charactar am I complaining about, but the HIDEOUS costume. It looked like it came from the clearance bin in your local halloween supplier. All in all, 3 out of 10. And you can keep my spelling mistakes.
8.0~Tons of Fun frozentitan1 Sign in Permalink My One Line Summary sums it up pretty good. This movie is a lot of fun to watch. It does not get bogged down with introducing our hero (Spider-Man) or anti-hero (Green Goblin). Each character is enjoyable to watch, the action is high, and the special effects are terrific. In my opinion, this movie with the role of introducing Spider-Man to the big production silver screen could not have been done much better. Tobey Maguire is a talented actor, but I really didn't think I would like him in this role. Well, he pulled it off. Well done Tobey. The other characters are all interesting without bogging the film down with too many details or being too light on substance. It was handled just perfectly for a comic book movie.
7.0~Amazing! kirktoon_2000 Sign in Permalink Marvel is finally making some good movies based on their characters, and Spider-man is the best of the bunch. This movie is very faithful to the comic book character, and it doesn't make Spider-man look corny. There is, however, some VERY corny comic book-like dialogue, but if you can let that slide, this is a very well crafted and enjoyable film.
8.0~Strong Acting Strengthens Film. peacham Sign in Permalink While rather light on plot,the acting talent in "Spider Man" elevated it from the average into a highly enjoyable film with many emotional moments. With a cast as talented as Toby McGuire,Rosemary Harris,Cliff Robertson,Williem Dafoe,Kirsten Dunst and J.K.Simmons and a screenplay that was not afraid to be touching,"Spiderman" becomes more than just a superhero film.The relationship between Peter and his Aunt and Uncle are especially well developed. Tony winner Harris and Oscar winner Robertson were the perfect pair to bring Aunt May and Uncle Ben to life.Dafoe gives us a villian that is so much more tormented than the standard scenery chewing maniac,and Dunst gets to show us the honest acting talent that we have known her capable of when given a well written script. While others have comented on the special effects and the action sequences,this is not what I left the theatre thinking of.I came away thinking of the bonds between family and the struggle to keep going in a changing world.
10.0~They Could Have Done Better... Angry_Arguer Sign in Permalink Spider-Man falls into a mix of Batman/Superman style of film. It wants to be memorable, but it is too shallow. If any film since 9/11 has bashed the whole "We are United" theme too hard into its script, this is it. I am disappointed in Sam Raimi for this. David Koep is one of Hollywood's biggest garbage writers, this is just slightly above par for his work. The main problem is that the movie starts to build up steam, but with nowhere to go. By the finale, the audience doesn't care what happens, just so long as the movie ends. Unfortunately, it is obvious that this was made more with financial concerns in mind as opposed to quality film. Willem Dafoe is a good actor, but his performance is too limited here. He needs to be more vibrant and expressive to contrast the underacting (and lack of talent) on behalf of Tobey Maguire. He never changes mood in all his movies. Raimi's camera is its usual unhinged self, but this time it isn't as poignant as in Army of Darkness or even Darkman. Sound suffers big time as everything boils down to either big noises and small noises. Poor sound design on this movie's part is not a bonus. Overall, not the best superhero flick ever made. Sometimes I wonder where they are planning to take the genre with this stuff. 2 out of 5 stars.
10.0~Spidey is Petey and M.J.'s a sweety, but Goblin is scary and creepy! RomeyRome Sign in Permalink I LOVE SPIDER-MAN! Okay, I know I've already commented on this movie but I just want to reiterate the fact that this movie is very enjoyable. I watched it on opening weekend in a movie theater in Los Feliz, California. Needless to say I was awe-struck!!! The movie's story stays mostly true to the comics with just a few exceptions. I liked the relationship between Peter Parker and Norman Osborn as well. There was a lot to like about this film. It had drama, humor, action, and lots of wonderful visuals to behold. I really hope that they include the menacing villain named Venom in the upcoming sequels. I know the perfect person to play Venom........................ME!!! Yep, if anyone could pull off the Eddie Brock character it's me. I could definitely learn to hate Spider-man, but only in the movies because I LOVE SPIDER-MAN. Alright, anyhow go watch this fantastic film and see the wall-crawler do his slinging and swinging. I cannot wait to catch the sequel to this movie. In the words of Uncle Ben......remember....."With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility!"
1.0~No Plot, no Acting, Bad Script, annoying characters. Worst movie since Godzilla. pegreenb Sign in Permalink I had been waiting for this movie to come out since, James Cameron starting working on the project. When Cameron lost out, I still thought that the movie would be worth watching. Boy was I mistaken. I really do not understand why this movie is sooo popular. The plot kept bouncing around, between a really bad "teen soap" and a want-to-be action movie. Sam Raimi (director) could not decide what this movie was about: was it just setup for future movies, was a pathetic love story, was it a "evil" good guy, a "good" guy, or Just a Well Hyped Movie to Make $$$$$. I think the latter. So overall, Way more disappointed then Episode I. Godzilla was a much more fluid, well written film. I would not pay the $3.50 to rent it. And I get to spend the night thinking about what the movie would/could have been, if it had been Cameron's Project
9.0~Spider-Man learns to crawl, but only later does he learn to fly! nived84 Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi's Spider-Man is full of energy, zipping and zooming across the screen with gleefully wild delight. The former Evil Dead creator's visual style for quick zooms and he's zany sense of humor is present throughout the film, but Raimi has also brought along his heart and passion for the comic book to his film. The film was written by David Keopp, fresh after writing David Fincher's Panic Room, and his script gets a few things right and a few things not so right, but in the end this is a pretty amusing and exciting sci-fi/adventure that's sure to keep you entertained. The cast of Spider-Man does a quite a good job, but I'll be honest when I first heard that Toby Maguire was going to be playing the role of Spider-Man I thought to myself, "Who? That nerdy kid from Pleasantville?", so obviously I had my doubts as to if he was up to the task of pulling off the part of Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Why Maguire is perfectly suited for the role of Spider-Man is because he can easily pull of the nerdy/boy-next-door look that is required for Peter Parker. Another good job in casting was getting Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn aka "The Green Goblin". Dafoe goes all Nicholson on us, and doesn't hold anything back; he's in full-on snarl and growl mode, and his voice and mannerisms fit well with the character he's playing. I particularly enjoyed the scene where he talks to himself in the mirror, showing his multiple personalities, a scene that's gone somewhat similar in Peter Jackson's The Two Towers. The special effects on the other hand aren't quite as flawless as the casting, but for the majority of the film they do work to one degree or another. In the scene where Parker discovers his powers and jumps along the roof tops it's pretty obvious that's a computer effect, but watching Spider-Man battle the Green Goblin on the Queensboro Bridge in the film's finale is quite something. The shots that seemed to take my breath away the most were the dramatic shots of Spider-Man swinging his way all around Manhattan and the cinematography by Don Burgess really helps add to the vibrant look of the film, which is very cool. However, there are a few little things and one big thing I didn't like about Spider-Man. First off, the little things. Personally I think Mary Jane looked a little "skanky" in the beginning of the movie. Was I the only one that thought that? Secondly, I wasn't surprised that Peter Parker lived with his Aunt and Uncle, but it certainly would have been nice to know exactly why that was. Then there's the overindulgent Macy Gray cameo that was completely pointless. And lastly, and most importantly I really didn't like how they decided to do the Green Goblin. If you've read the comic book series Ultimate Spider-Man by Brian Michael Bendis the Green Goblin was created by Norman Osborn injecting himself with a green plasma in a syringe, and then psychically and literally turning into a green monster, which looked much more menacing than the space suite and helmet they ended up using the film. I thought that was a really, really bad choice, because of two reasons. One, it seemed a little strange that the Military would actual end up wearing a goofy looking helmet like that, and two, it just wasn't dark enough for me. But put aside those few complaints I think the film is still pretty good, but it could have been a little better. As for right now I'm giving this film a score of a seven, it's a pretty good film, with a good cast and some fun action sequences that's also able to get us involved with the characters and enjoy them on a small emotional level, so for those reasons it is a success, but it certainly could have used a little tweaking here and there.
3.0~Mmehhh kalvarnsen Sign in Permalink Overall the movie stunk and I didn't like it. The only shining point of the movie was the scene with Jim Norton. Although he had only 1 line it was a brilliant moment that definitely made the movie worth while. The producers of this film obviously wanted to add class to this film and certainly did with such a fancy man. You could actually feel the raw monster rain emotion in his line. I really feel that this man could have made iteven bigger if it wasn't for the fact that he has the muscle tone of a paraplegics legs. I feel that they should of used more of him but oh well. I feel that the direction of the movie was good, although it could have used more Opie and Anthony. It could have also used the super hero "Master PO". Overall....Like I said....If it wasn't for Jim Norton, the movie is just not worth while. Grrr Grrrr.
9.0~Excellent adaptation to film orangetea2 Sign in Permalink After watching Sar Wars: Attack of the Clones, the success of this movie's opening weekend in comparison becomes entirely understandable. The action sequences are satisfying, the entertainment value is pretty high. What distinguishes this film from others opening at the beginning of the summer season is the remarkably fine acting of Tobey MacGuire and Willem Dafoe. Lucas should pay attention here--it pays to use actors who know their way around a film script. The acting itself gives a sense of immediacy and the performances provide depth to already familiar characters. As far as story goes, it is very much in keeping with what you already know about the Spiderman story, and the romantic subplot remains appropriately in the background as motivation to propel the classic good-versus-evil plot. An excellent movie, perhaps even more appreciated after one views the mediocre Star Wars: Episode II. You can't help noticing what this movie does so right in contrast to the many wrong turns taken by Lucas's contemporary effort.
9.0~Great movie overall, despite some obvious mistakes hil5924 Sign in Permalink Walking into the theatre the last night of opening weekend, I had high hopes for the movie. Needless to say, I was very impressed with the movie. Yeah, the special effects were a little choppy at times, but that is a characteristic of Raimi's style. Overall, the story was solid, the characters showed a sense of humanity in them. I had yet to see this in a comic book movie. Might take 2nd for biggest box office gross for the year.
10.0~What is there to say? nammerboy Sign in Permalink To put things simple, short, and sweet...the movie clearly speaks for itself. No one needs to be told how good it is; it's more of a feeling when you leave the theatre and realize that the only word that you can find to describe it is, "wow..." - some things leave you breathless, and it just so happens that this is one of them. wow...
4.0~Another generic comic book movie CAOP Sign in Permalink If you have seen any mediocre comic book movies (aren't most of them mediocre, except for Batman?) you will surely have no need to see this movie. It is exactly the same. Not awful. Not good. Nothing new. No surprises. If you have seen every movie on the AFI 100 or the IMDB top 100, MAYBE you have an excuse to see Spiderman.
7.0~It's A Bird, It's a Plane, It's-- Spider-Man? moviewizguy Sign in Permalink Based on Marvel Comics' superhero character, this is a story of Peter Parker who is a nerdy high-schooler. He was orphaned as a child, bullied by jocks, and can't confess his crush for his stunning neighborhood girl Mary Jane Watson. One day while on an excursion to a laboratory a runaway radioactive spider bites him... and his life changes in a way no one could have imagined. Peter acquires powers a spider has... but the fun isn't going to last. An eccentric millionaire Norman Osborn administers a performance enhancing drug on himself and his maniacal alter ego Green Goblin emerges. Now Peter Parker has to become Spider-Man and take Green Goblin to the task... or else Goblin will kill him. They come face to face and the war begins in which only one of them will survive at the end. I don't know why I didn't like this film as much as everybody did. I think it lacked something. No, I liked the character's origins. No, not the action, since they were great with breathtaking special effects. Maybe they could have done more with the action or more with the villain (although I didn't like the Green Goblin as a villain). Everything good in the film isn't great, comparing to great superhero films like its sequel, Spider-Man 2 and 3, Daredevil, or Hellboy. I liked the action sequences in the film, and I liked the humor from some scenes. Tobey Maguire playing Spider-Man was relatively good, as well as Willem Dafoe and Kirsten Dunst. The score was good, as well as the cinematography. Maybe I was expecting more than they showed in the movie. This film was good, but it wasn't anything great. It fell short with my expectations. I didn't like the ending. Just expect what you want.
8.0~Awesome! ElmStreetsLastBrat Sign in Permalink I never had an interest in seeing Spider-Man. But it came on TBS tonight and there was nothing else on TV so I decided to watch it. And to my surprise I thoroughly enjoyed it. I've never been a fan of comic books but I love the Batman and Superman movies and now I'm a fan of the Spider-Man films! Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker, a shy, nerdy, high school student who is in love with Mary Jane, played by Kirsten Dunst. One day Peter is bitten by a genetically altered spider and instantly gains spider-like powers, such as climbing walls and shooting webs out of his hands. Once he becomes Spider-Man, the name the townspeople gave him after he rescues them from fires and robberies, he has to battle the Green Goblin, aka Norman Osborn, played with creepy perfection by Willem Dafoe. Norman becomes the Green Goblin after being fired from his job and taking revenge against his employees. Norman's son Harry, played by James Franco, is one of Peter's closest friends and competes against Peter for the affection of Mary Jane. The best parts of the film is when Spider-Man and the Green Goblin are battling one another. They are wonderfully choreographed and edited. One of the best battle scenes is right towards the end. Willem Dafoe was great as the Green Goblin. No one could have played him better. He just has that creepy look to him and how he even used a different voice when he was becoming the Green Goblin was effectively eerie. Tobey Maguire was good as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Even though he is a little too boyish looking for me he still had that unique charm about him that made you love Peter Parker. He was sweet and made you wonder why Mary Jane would never give him the time of day! I know a lot of people didn't like him as Spider-Man but I did! Kirsten Dunst was also good as Mary Jane. To me she seemed to play all the other characters she plays in her other films but I liked her. She was sweet. And James Franco was sweet and charming as Harry Osborn. Spider-Man is a great comic book based movie and I really enjoyed it. I'm glad I actually sat down and watched it. The action scenes were spectacular, the costumes were cool, and all the characters were lovable. This is a great movie. Thanks for reading my review!
10.0~this is the greatest comic adaption dx_the_game76 Sign in Permalink I went and saw Spider-Man yesterday and I loved it. It could not of been better. Tobey Maguire played the geeky Peter Parker perfectly. Willem Dafoe was great too. He played Norman Osborn perfect and played the goblin perfect. Even though he was in the movie for about 2 minutes, Bruce Campbell had a key part. He actually gave Spider-Man his name. And the guy who played J.Johna Jamieson played his arrogant pompus ass perfect. If you are indeed looking for the best movie of the summer go see Spider-Man
8.0~Wall climbing, Web spinning ACTION. XirdnehImijErif Sign in Permalink Its about a young man with a great physique in spandex climb walls, and fight another gentleman riding a hovering skateboard. Not only is the guy called "Spiderman"the hero, the villain is called the "Green Goblin". Watch the young Peter Parker grow into the man ... nay the Spiderman that women fall first into distress for then into love with, and the one the men wish to become. As Spiderman takes form during this movie and fight the daily bugle's never ending condescending comments on him he finds a way to still live a normal life and chase after his true love MJ. This one is an instant marvel classic. This movie will blow your mind strictly on the fact that women alone are deathly afraid of spiders, but it goes to show if the spider is strong cute and can save your life the spider can steal your girl away as easy as saying "Im your neighborhood friendly Spiderman."
8.0~Thanksgiving scene was a masterpiece lol Badmoviessuck Sign in Permalink What a great movie this is. It might corny and filled with the cheese but that's a part of what makes this movie so good. CHARACTER Toby maguire is an excellent Peter parker. They gave him a short but great character arc in the beginning of the movie but even after that they managed to make Peter parker a great loving character and you can see that with the dialogue that is being provided. For example the first time Mary Jane and Peter parker are having a real discussion and when Peter parker talks to Mary jane after graduating college all these dialogues show how great and loving of a character Peter is. Harry is a decent character who is affected by his father not being there for him and it shows there is more to come. Mary Jane was damsel in distress and was a pretty meh character. VILLAIN I would call Green goblin one of the greatest generic villains i have ever seen. He might be generic but i still love him (Maybe cause of Willem Dafoe's performance) But at least he faced a challenge for Peter. SPIDER-MAN Toby maguire isn't that good of a Spider-Man cause he dosen't speak alot or make any jokes. THANKSGIVING The thanksgiving scene was amazing. This were all gets bad. Osborn figures out Peter's secret and Henry and MJ arent in such a good terms when Norman says some rude stuff. It was a great set-up to the end and i know there is a greater reson to why this scene is so great but i cant come up with it (i'll edit this later when i do) VERDICT A quick review can't wait to watch the sequel.
8.0~A great hero flick TankThinker Sign in Permalink Having no interest in Spider Man and finding Tobey Maguire to be irritating to say the least, I avoided seeing this film when it was released. Then one night, friends brough it over as a rental and rather than twiddle my thumbs in another room being anti-social, I figured I'd grit my way through it. Boy, was I surprised. First off, without being a Spider Man expert, I still found Tobey MaGuire to be a total fit for the film and the character and secondly, Spider Man turned out to be a pretty good guy, not to mention the makings of a pretty good film. No cheesiness, no going over the top and the director totally created the alternate world necessary for a Super Hero perfectly. By the time the movie was really getting going, I, the anti MaGuire chick was totally rooting for his character and had really sunken into the world being portrayed. No wonder this film made so much money at the box office. Funnily enough, if I could play God and decide which movie deserved to do better at the box office, I would pick Spider-Man over Titanic any day of the week. Complete entertainment, great effects (I love when he's chasing a car down town from building to building, a loveable geeky, understated main character and Kirsten Dunst as a sweetie that still manages to be a spitfire. If I had children, I would have no hesitation in buying them this DVD as the content is entertaining enough for an adult but imaginative and suitable for a child. I don't know who directed it (so flog me), but whoever did, did a hell of a good job. Give me this over SuperMan anyday. A real recommend for a holiday movie, a family movie and a movie to just sit back and be entertained by. And to Tobey, my apologies for not having seen the other side of you.
10.0~A Comic Book Hero Brought to Full Fledged Life!! ChristopherLee Sign in Permalink I saw this film in the theater's, and I must say I left the theater feeling overwhelmingly satisfied. It is a GREAT picture for ALL family members to enjoy!! I was so happy to see this film put together with the perfect blend of ACTION, DRAMA, COMEDY, and just a tiny amount of romance. I just bought it on DVD yesterday, and I have already had the chance to view this WONDERFUL film again. If you have not seen this movie yet, YOU ARE MISSING OUT. I cannot wait for the forthcoming sequel to hit the big screen. I will be one of the first to line up and see what great things part two has to offer!!!! If it's anything like the first one; I will not be disappointed!!
5.0~Pretty good... not earth-shattering. TheCooperVane Sign in Permalink Overall, not the best work from Sam Raimi (this should have been closer to Darkman in tone - much more compelling that way). The CGI is not quite right, the suspension of disbelief required is a bit too much (what, no one could figure out that something might be up qith the sudden emergence of Spiderman and the kid at school who can suddenly do all sorts of things he couldn't before?), and the last act of the movie is just plastic. However, it was an enjoyable ride - it isn't fulfilling, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a pleasure. The first act in particular is great - establishment and discovery. Those early scenes provide the greatest charms. The action's pretty decent, if you can bring yourself to care about two CGI characters duking it out. I think if there were more stunts and less computers, the mechanical feel of some of the set pieces would shed off, and I'd have been more excited by what I saw. I'd see it again - it was fun! But it doesn't quite deliver on its promise. 7/10.
10.0~One of the Best Movies of all time. Mustangsallly Sign in Permalink I have to say that this movie was Sam Raimi's best movie of all time. Many people don't like this mkovie for some reason and that is their opinion, but I personally thought that it was one of the best movies of all time and highly reccommend for people to see this movie. I've already seen it three times and it was in less than a week. I'm not even a comic book fan! The casting was almost perfect. Tobey Maguire fits as the nerd gone cool image of Peter Parker. Willem Dafoe makes probably the best villian since Jack Nicholson in Batman and James Franco works as his son. He looks a lot like Willem Dafoe, so he passes off as his son very well. All though some of the lines are a bit cheesy, they happen to be some of my favorite lines for that reason. It links the movie to its comic book origin. Over all the movie keeps you at the edge of your seat and wishing that you too had super powers.
10.0~Amazing! BlueForest Sign in Permalink I was so impressed with this. Everything was done right. Special effect was really fun, characters are all well-developed, plot was clear and interesting. I have to say this is the best remake of comics I have ever seen. I would go back and see this again and again on the big screen.
7.0~A great movie! brando-19 Sign in Permalink Spidey did indeed rock...i give it a 7.5 out of 10. Here are my only complaints. 1: The CG was great, but it just wasn't mind blowing over the top holy freaking crap great. Keep in mind, I had literally JUST come from a digital presentation of some Star Wars Episode2 stuff from Celebration2, so I went in with very high expectations. This took the movie down from a 10 to a 9. 2: I was not completely happy with Spiderman's personality. He was way to happy-go-lucky for me. I thought the producers could have really done some cool things if they would have made him a little darker and more mysterious, not as far as batman, but just a little would have been perfect. I thought the door was wide open for this to happen after a certain scene I won't mention for spoiler reasons. This took my rating down from 9 to 7.5. Other than that, it was awesome. Go check it out, it will get you ready for AOTC in just 10 days!
9.0~Spider-Man has set the bar high for the future of superhero movies SinjinSB Sign in Permalink I had heard talk of a Spider-Man movie for well over a decade with different directors and actors rumored to be involved. Then it became official and it was announced that Sam Raimi would be the director, Tobey Maguire would be Spider-Man, Kirsten Dunst would be Mary Jane, and Willem Dafoe would be the Green Goblin. I have to admit I was a little worried. Would they pull it off...a movie worthy of one of my favorite superheros. What they did was simply make the best superhero movie to date. I was afraid the special effects would be cheesy, but they were highly believable and fun to watch. I was concerned that the actors wouldn't be up to their roles, but they all turned in great performances. I was worried that they wouldn't stay true to the story and though they did take some liberties, they never strayed too far. I went in with high hopes and what I got was a very enjoyable film. Good for both kids and adults. Spider-Man has set the bar high for the future of superhero movies. I hope we continue to get some high quality movies with the upcoming releases of Daredevil & The Hulk in 2003. I have a lot of the same concerns, but hopefully they'll come through like Spider-Man did. Rank: #2 in 2002 ***1/2 (out of 4)
8.0~One of the best.Better than the first Superman. barry slavin Sign in Permalink Spiderman has both a good plot and sub plot. The "out of costume" story is as good as the "Spiderman" story plot. I was interested in both. The computer effects are o.k. but it is the story that carries the film. I felt that it was better than the first Superman but not as good as the first Batman. But that is just my opinion. Some of the people, who saw the film with me thought it was the best ever. If possible, try to see Spiderman at a large theater, not at a multiplex. Barry Slavin
8.0~Amazing Fun! eamon-hennedy Sign in Permalink Hugely entertaining from the outset, Spiderman is very much the big screen Marvel equivalent to DC's Superman. Both have a bright outlook, both films aren't too dark, in the way that Tim Burton and Bryan Singer would do it, while there is a sense of humor along the way that does not border on camp (take note Joel Schumacher). Where Sam Raimi succeeds, in much the same way that Richard Donner, Richard Lester, Tim Burton and Bryan Singer succeeded too, is that while remaining faithful to the source material, he isn't afraid to put a little of his own spin into it, so we get some of the trademarks such as Bruce Campbell and at times some horrifying violence (not to horrifying mind, the film is a 12 certificate), but he retains the charm of the comic book and does a faithful adaptation of the source, especially with regards to the back story of the character, which is where this film works the most. Yes the action sequences are spectacular, but it is the smaller character moments where Raimi really succeeds at, surprising considering he is the film maker behind the Evil Dead films. The portrayal of Peter's love for Mary Jane is superbly done, further enhanced by Tobey Maguire. Sure he may not look the part of Spiderman, but he is Spiderman. This quirky piece of casting works in much the same way that Micheal Keaton did in the first Batman movie. He may not fully look the part, but playing it can be a different matter. Maguire is superb, particularly when playing out the reason that he becomes Spiderman, in a scene that does not flinch away from the most important part of the back story of the comic book. Likewise Willem Dafoe is wonderfully over the top as the Green Goblin. While not immediately a scene stealer in the way Jack Nicholson was in Batman or Ian McKellen in X Men or even Gene Hackman in Superman, Dafoe is an actor's actor and the excellence of the scenes where his split personality comes to the surface are over the top in a wonderful comic book movie way. As for Kirsten Dunst, how could you not fall in love with her. Talented and beautiful, like Maguire this is perfect casting and Raimi has good ingredients to work with here. When Parker does become Spiderman the film dips into traditional comic book fare, he saves damsels in distress while the Green Goblin makes his a choice between saving M-J or some kids to which he does both, but nevertheless the film remains constantly entertaining and Raimi isn't afraid to be that little bit brutal with the final confrontation between good guy and bad guy. Even better is that while the ending is open, it doesn't have the the aura of sequel hunting that X Men had. In fact it is more in line with Batman and Superman. Parker will always be around to fight evil and the film's story is resolved. The film is fantastically entertaining, never bores and is undeniably one of the best comic book adaptations to hit the screen. Raimi has got it perfect and I for one cannot wait for the sequel.
8.0~What A Great Chick-flick! watercrake Sign in Permalink Now that I've seen the movie that everyone else was yammerin' about I realize that they were right! It's really a good movie. Sam Raimi paces this film with such a deft hand that the only time I looked away from the screen was to see the silly grins on my kid's faces. Even so, I feel people should know that this is no "origin of a superhero so we can bring out lesser sequels later on" type film. The actors so commit to this movie that there is a real, tangible character film here. Tobey Maguire brings such a humanity to his tights that you just love him from scene one. Kirsten Dunst is drop-dead gorgeous and you can see why he's been in love with her since grade one. But folks...this is a love story. Action takes a back seat to a fantastic intriguing story of boy meets girl. Go see it...and take a tissue.
8.0~Falls short of being a true classic, but nevertheless an extraordinarily good blockbuster. Parallax-UK Sign in Permalink Recent advances in special-effects technology seems to have triggered quite a spate of super-hero films, although few have been as high profile as Spider-Man. As what has now become traditional, the film begins by telling the story of how the hero, in this case Peter Parker, becomes the titular super-hero. The story is told well. Although many purists have criticised certain liberties the makers have taken with the original storyline (such as Spidey's web-shooters being organic in the film, as opposed to manufactured), none have been taken unnecessarily. If any criticism can be made, it is that some of the characterisation is not as strong as it could have been. Although Tobey Maguire brings a lot to the Peter Parker character, he did seem to be playing him as Clarke Kent. Also, Aunt May is hugely one-dimensional. Okay, this is a film of a comic book, but when the characters are flatter than those that featured in the cartoon, alarm bells ring. Characterisation aside, the film as a whole has many good points. The story is competent, although some loose ends were left. The special effects have been much discussed. Whereas many were very good, there was the occasional piece of CGI stunt-work that was so clumsy (think of the TV show Andromeda) that suspension of disbelief was brought crashing down to earth on several occasions. Another problem with this was the spectacle of the film. Although the scenes of Spidey swinging through New York were satisfying, one can't help but feel that an opportunity has been missed to really go for the breathtaking, heart-stopping, amazing spectacle that the trailer promised. For example, for those lucky enough to witness the awe-inspiring sight of a helicopter caught up in a giant web suspended between the mighty Twin Towers in the teaser released prior to the tragic events in New York will be disappointed to see that no scene in the film comes close to provoking such astonishment. I've said a lot of negative things about this film, but that isn't because it's poor. In fact, it is an extremely good film, with a reasonably strong and amusing story, and scenes that will stay with you for a while after seeing them. The reason I've criticised the film is because it was so close to being truly great - a real classic. Instead, it is merely very good, and I would highly recommend anyone who enjoys blockbusters to see it. My score: 8/10
10.0~Wow! echleon Sign in Permalink After leaving the theatre, there was only one word which came out from my wide mouth... "WOW!" Imagine close to 2hrs of adrenline pumping action scenes, webswinging from building to building, cool 'kung fu' moves and not to forgetting our favourite hero Spider-man! I must say the hype for this flick has lived up to my expectations. Maguire and Dunst acted pretty well enough to sustain my interest in the film. All in all, one helluva good time. It gets my 5-star approval for the Action Flick of the year...
6.0~Go in as if you are 8 and you would love it. madhattar Sign in Permalink Everyone was telling me on how awful the film was and how silly it all is. Ofcoarse, i didn't go in expecting a deep and meaningful film about the world blah blah blah. cinema is about enjoying yourself, what really gets to me is that there are more bad (i want to be deep action films) than (hey i know i am silly, but this is cinema!) which turns out really good. like in MIB you know it is silly and you know it will be fun. i had a great time, then again i am into comics so maybe it would be helpful to read up on the older spiderman comics just to get the sillyness of it. Go, enjoy a happy film about a guy jumping around in a suit. Apart from that, the only thing that is annoying is the trend of attaching a love story to every film these days, whether we need to or not. but here it works, cause peter is nothing without mary....p.s. i hate when they use M.J... too hip wanna be. and please ignore the spelling mistakes
10.0~Not since Superman... DrWetter Sign in Permalink Not since Superman has there been such a wonderful and accurate adaptation of a comic book hero. I was so disappointed with Batman (which did a better job of detailing the creation of the Joker than it did the title character). Maguire is perfectly cast, and does a superb job in the role. While I thought the special effects were good (you could tell they were CGI characters), who cares? I was swept away by the story, acting, and magic of the movie. I cannot wait for the DVD. Kudos to Rami and all involved with the picture... well done!
7.0~good but could have been better yayagirl14 Sign in Permalink I have to say I really do love watching this movie. It is completely entertaining, and is worth watching. But i think that Spiderman does have some major flaws. For instance, I think Kirsten Dundst is HORRIBLE, not . just as Mary Jane, but in general. She is an OK actress, but she always looks like she is either falling asleep, or completely possessed. And i don't think she knows the meaning of posture. I think if opened her eyes stood up straight, takes some more technique based acting, she would be just wonderful. Too bad though. Tobey Macguire is fine, he doesn't seem as strong minded as i thought he was, more of a superman. Also his faces when he is running over buildings just really make the movie amazing because they are so melodramatic and over the top its hilarious. I of course love James Franco, but i think his character was a little pointless, i know they needed to lead up to him hating Spiderman and such, but he seemed just so weak and sallow most of the time, instead of this strong school boy. The scripting some times was a little ... cheesy. Especially some of the goblin's lines, not that i don't think Willem Dafoe is a great actor, I think he had to work very hard to make his character not a Power Ranger. I am very glad that they did do some back ground, though there was a little much. I personally did not know the back ground story of Spiderman, though i know many people do, i thought it was interesting to know. I just thought he was Spiderman because he was, not so much of the spider biting and his uncle and stuff. Also the CGI sometimes is great and sometimes is HORIFIC! As i watch the movie i get very confused because i think i am watching a cartoon. But it does make you laugh and i like to laugh so it is a bitter sweet goof. But through all this, the movie is entertaining and i like to watch it. And i am very excited for Spiderman 3.
8.0~The best comic crossover yet. justincward Sign in Permalink This film definitely recreates the engrossing entertainment that a good comic delivers. There is clever humour, exciting action and plenty of reasonable plot complexity to keep you guessing. Tobey Maguire is cast perfectly, and even manages to make the script sound intelligent. Spiderman is completely successful in translating the atmosphere of the Stan Lee/Steve Ditko comic book, and that's a good thing. Minus points? The Willem Dafoe villain. While Spiderman is a neurotic, error-prone (semi-)human, Green Goblin is a cardboard cutout, a stereotypical sci-fi bogie man - even the graphic style of his costume is wrong, he looks like a 1980's Marvel villain, and doesn't match the perfectly captured vintage webslinger. Maybe his son, in the inevitable SpideyII, will get it right. That said, this is how superhero films should look!
9.0~A promising start that will soon get better departed07 Sign in Permalink I saw Spider-Man on May 5, 2002 and I got to say that I was surprised that director Sam Raimi did a good job transiting a popular comic book to the big screen. Not since Batman or Superman has there been a movie about a great comic book hero. Spider-Man tells the story of Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), a timid and shy student who is picked on and has feelings for Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but doesn't have the confidence to tell her how much he loves her; until one day when Peter and his classmates go to the New York laboratory. That is where Peter is bitten by a radio-active spider which weakens him for a while and all of a sudden he has super-strength within himself. How our hero starts out as Spider-Man is from the comics with his Uncle Ben(Cliff Robertson) droping off Peter at the library, but instead he decides to go behind his uncle's back and goes to fight at the wrestling for money. After a robbery, Peter has no choice but to go after the suspect and that is where he starts out as Spider-Man. Just like every movie there is a villain, and the bad guy is Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin(Willem Defoe) after an accident in the laboratory. Now Green Goblin wants to go after Spider-Man and hurt those along the way. Here are the pros and cons. Pros: Finally, Spider-Man gets to come to the big screen where Tobey Maguire does a wonderful job of playing the timid Peter Parker with those boyish looks. Kirsten Dunst is a marvel as the lady in distress where her chemistry with Maguire works as if they were meant to be together. Willem Dafoe is still creepy off his "Shadow of the Vampire" persona as the Goblin where he manages to ham up more scenes than Nicholson's Joker. Cons: The first hour works fine with the human effects until the second hour where the special effects dominates of not caring for a plot or any of the other characters. Most of the action sequences from a far away shot looks fake as if there's no weight or dimension. Not even the supporting characters have much screen time where it just leaves Maguire and Dafoe. Overall, a pretty decent film. Spider-Man proves to be a worthy comic book movie for fans of the books or the hero. The film also stars James Franco as Harry Osborn, Rosemary Harris as Aunt May, and J.K. Simmons as J.J. Jameson.
7.0~I liked what I saw, even though I'm not a fan of comic books philip_vanderveken Sign in Permalink Comic books like Spider-man, Superman, Hellboy,... have always been a part of the American popular culture, but aren't well known by the biggest part of the European public. So when a movie, based on one of these comics (we've seen several passing by in the multiplexes in recent years) is released, its main audience will be American as well. Unless they make something spectacular out of it of course, and that's exactly what the makers did with this movie. Spider-man is a movie full of spectacular computer animated graphics, plenty of action and symbolism and, much to my surprise, with a decent story (even though that's not the main reason why you should watch this movie). Peter Parker is a nerdy high school student who gets bitten by a genetically modified spider. Its DNA gets mixed with Parker's DNA and gradually he finds out that he now has capabilities he could only dream of before. He's strong, he can scale walls and ceilings without any help or appliances and he has some kind of sense that allows him to avoid dangerous situations. At first he only uses his powers to make money as an amateur wrestler, but when his uncle gets killed by a criminal, he decides to use his powers only to fight crime and to help society and to win the affections of his classmate Mary Jane Watson. In the meantime Norman Osborn, a scientist and businessman is exposed to some kind of nerve gas that he was developing for the military and develops an alternative personality: the evil Green Goblin. Despite the fact that the Green Goblin looked more like a bad guy from the "Power Ranger" and wasn't very original or impressive to me, the entire movie wasn't as bad as I feared. I actually had a good time watching this movie that, let's be honest, wouldn't get much attention if the stunning computer graphics weren't in it. So, despite the fact that I'm not a fan of comic books and the fact that the Green Goblin wasn't the most successful character, I liked what I saw. That's why I give it a 7.5/10.
10.0~Spectacular dales-4 Sign in Permalink I suggest for all of you who are disappointed with the realness of this movie need to remember, it's Spider-man. What did you expect? Go into this movie and enjoy it for what it is. Pure escapism at its best and a movie which kept me (a 15-year comic reader) entertained from the opening credits to the closing ones. It did for me what Star Wars and Lord of the Rings never did, live up to it's own hype. Sure it had its gaps but I think it's a great start to what will be a spectacular franchise. So here's looking forward to Spider-man 2 as I give Spider-man a 8/10
10.0~05/04/02 Terrific Movie Experience goob1 Sign in Permalink This is the first time that I have written a comment on the database so I figured I would start with the best movie I've seen in the last 2 years. From the opening credits to the end of the movie I thought everything was just perfect. I've never seen Tobey Macguire in a movie before, so I was very amazed at the job he did in the movie. He looks and acts just like Peter Parker would have acted. Kirsten Dunst was outstanding as Mary Jane, she should have kept her hair blonde and played Gwen Stacy though. Willem Dafoe played the Green Goblin with great enthusiasm and was a great villain. I would give Spiderman a great big 10!! It will be the first movie since Titanic that I will go see more than once in the movie theater.
7.0~Stylish, yet somewhat disappointing! MinorityReporter Sign in Permalink Being an avid fan of the comic book I really looked forward to this movie and for a long time I convinced myself that I liked the film. However, after a long time of self denial I bought the Spider-Man DVD and I saw the film for what it truly was. A disappointment. The magic from the comic books had evaporated. The acting in the film is a mixed bag. Tobey Maguire is well cast but his overall acting and presence isn't very good. He does the nerd part very well but when it comes to being a super hero he falls short. Spider-Man was always a complex character with great internal struggles but the film medium doesn't convey this very well because we don't get the inner monologue that Spider-Man is so well known for. He therefore has to act with facial expressions and body language. Tobey has a pretty well defined body language but his facial expressions are somewhat lacking. Also the fact that he is wearing the Spider-Man suit in many scenes prevent us from clearly reading what is going on in his head at the moment. Kirsten Dunst is just miscast. She is a horrible actress with zero talent and no resemblance with the character she plays making her performance utterly unbelievable. Willem Dafoe is usually a brilliant actor but in Spider-Man he seems to have dumbed down quite a bit and although his schizophrenic scenes are pretty interesting they do not cover for the fact that this is Dafoe's most mediocre performance in years. James Franco who plays Harry Osborn is remarkably boring in his performance. His voice never seems to change making him a young Keanu Reeves. The most interesting and well cast actor is J.K. Simmons who plays J. Jonah Jameson and if there was ever a guy who looked like the character he is meant to play it is Simmons. This is in both looks, voice and presence. The overall effects in the movie are undoubtedly very good and this makes the action sequences seem more believable. Spider-Man was nominated for an Oscar in the effects department but deservedly the Oscar went to The Fellowship of the Ring because while the effects are good they are far from brilliant. I will even go as far as to say that the only really good effects scene is the one at the very end where Spider-Man swings through the city. This scene, however, almost saves the film because it is brilliant and it is the only scene I can watch again and again. Danny Elfman's score is very good and it really suiting for a super hero movie. It really shows that Elfman has done a super hero movie score before. I am of course referring to Batman which is undoubtedly one of the best scores ever and you can certainly feel that Elfman used some of the experiences from that film in Spider-Man. The score has an epic feel to it that suits the film very well. The music is beyond reproach. Where the film fails is in the fact that it is too proper and it feels too much like it was adapted for kids which is in my opinion a mistake because the film had tremendous potential but it seems wasted because it never really becomes an adult film. Also the ending on the bridge is based on a well known story in the Spider-Man mythology where Spider-Man's first love Gwen Stacy dies in Spider-Man's battle with Green Goblin. I think they should have brought on Gwen Stacy for the first film and then introduced Mary Jan in the second movie. because it would have given Spider-Man a greater sense of loss and a better reason to hate Green Goblin if his first love had died at his hands but instead Raimi plays it safe and has Spider-Man save both the children in the lift and Mary Jane. It just seems too stupid. All in all Spider-Man was not the movie I was hoping for. I expected the best film ever and it certainly didn't deliver. Having said that and having seen the film a couple of times on DVD now I have grown to appreciate it a bit more. My primary issue with the film is that seems that the film wasn't directed for the fans of the character who expected a better adaptation but instead the film becomes a main stream Blockbuster with a wide range which isn't necessarily a bad thing but being a hardcore Spider-Man fan I would have liked to see a more adult film. Spider-Man is a good effort though and the effects alone deserve to be watched. 7/10
8.0~Sam Raimi pulled it off folks. chrisbrown6453 Sign in Permalink The Spider-Man movie is one of those unique comic book adaptations that fulfill all of the fans expectations and will undoubtedly please just about everyone who sees it. After seeing what Raimi did with Marvel Comics wall-crawling superhero, I doubt that even James Cameron himself could have done better. Benefiting from four decades worth of comic book stories that have been told, Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp know what works and what doesn't when crafting the cinematic version of Spider-Man's origin. Indeed, it's a testament to the filmmakers' faith and love for the source material that so much of the movie's character arcs and plot points are borrowed directly from the comic books. If you're a fan of Spidey you'll be able to pick up on the many recognizable situations sprinkled throughout the movie. If not, don't worry. It won't affect your enjoyment one bit. Placed front-and-center in the hero's role, Tobey Maguire does a great job of giving a face to teenage science geek Peter Parker, as well as the wiseass mannerism of Spider-Man. Maguire may not have been the most likely actor to leap into my mind when I thought about who should put on the blue and red spandex costume, but damn it if the kid doesn't play the perfect Peter...and any comic fan worth his weight will tell you that's way more important to nail than filling out the Spider suit (evident in the Batman series.) The same holds true for Willem Dafoe who nails the unenviable task of playing Norman Osborne and his maniacal alter ego The Green Goblin. In lesser hands the Goblin could have easily been a watered down version of Jack Nicholson's Joker from Batman. Instead, Dafoe gives a crackling vibrant energy in his scenes as Spidey's nemesis, and any reservations I had about the Guyver-like Goblin costume were dispelled once Dafoe's Goblin hit his stride and started cackling his torments to his victims. While no one will ever argue that Kristen Dunst isn't lovely to look at as Mary Jane, Peter/Spider-Man's love interest, really there's not much to her part. If there's a weakness the movie version of Spider-Man has it comes from her acting, and her character not serving much of a purpose except to serve as Peter's unrequited love and float from boyfriend to boyfriend. I'm hoping that MJ will have more to do in the sequel, and perhaps some much needed acting lessons. Maybe a little romantic tension from a secondary love interest for Peter, like comic book hotties Gwen Stacy or Betty Brant, or maybe even someone pining for Spidey, such as Felicia Hardy/Black Cat, would definitely stir the pot. Incidentally, I read somewhere that the decision to shorten Mary Jane's name to MJ for this movie was based on the fact that Mary Jane is universally recognized as another name for marijuana, and we can't be having that in a kids movie now can we. The remainder of the cast shines in their supporting roles. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson play a perfect Aunt May and Uncle Ben while J.K. Simmons manages to steal every scene he's in as Peter's Daily Bugle boss J. Jonah Jameson. As Harry Osborne, James Franco does a great job, an awesome job, of playing a best friend and a tormented son. After watching his final scene in this film, I'd like to change my vote from seeing villains like The Lizard or Doctor Octopus in the sequel to instead bringing Franco back and give him the spotlight as the next big bad guy Spider-Man faces. He does, after all, turn into the Hob Goblin. The special effects do an outstanding job of showing us the concrete canyons Spider-Man swings through. Moments such as the first time Peter experiments with swinging left to right down a city street, or when he crawls up a wall for the first time, or the webbing he leaves behind are all executed brilliantly. This is the stuff all the fans have been dreaming about seeing. If you were worried the CGI would look CGI-ish, it does. But don't worry, you won't be disappointed. Other than Dunst's bad acting, the only part that disappointed me about this much anticipated film was the fact that it was decided to keep Spiderman's original red and blue suit. Ugh. Look what Tim Burton did to Batman, and how it helped, if not completely change, the idea of a comic book hero being real. It was hard to watch this `hero' run around in his pajamas, and believe me; I had pajamas EXACTLY like those. Should have gave him a black outfit, or at least a redesigned one. Spider-Man is a wonderful delight, the first real blockbuster of this summer. Sam Raimi remained absolutely true to the spirit of the character but was smart enough to know what aspects needed to be re-forged into the film's story.
10.0~absolutely perfect mightybass Sign in Permalink this was easily the best movie i've ever seen. i was so pleased it lived up to all the hype and expectations. go out and see it. then go see it again 3 more times. then forget you just saw it 4 times and see it again. i've seen it 3 times and it only continues to get better. from beginning to end it was non-stop action and excitement. i was on the edge of my seat, hands clenched, heart racing, eyes glued to the screen the entire time. the casting was amazing. dunst and maguire fit their roles to a T and make you forget they are just actors playing a part. as does the rest of the line-up. not to mention a couple wonderful cameos(which i'll leave to you to spot on your own). special effects, costuming, sound/music all add to this amazing piece of cinematic genius. superb ending. one of the few movies i've seen that managed to start strong and end stronger. perfect setup for a sequel. no 1000 word review could ever do this movie justice. i highly recommend everyone to go out and see this movie. definitely worth your money.
5.0~It's alright. I think it falls short of its reputation EthanBJones_03 Sign in Permalink Directed By: Sam Rami Starring: Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and Willem Dufoe Overall: I don't mind this movie but I think it is heavily over rated. It's entertaining but I don't think it deserves its acclaim. Good: 1. Tobey Maguire is pretty good as socially awkward Peter Parker but a less fulfil job as Spider-Man. 2. Kirsten Dunst was also pretty good as Mary Jane. 3. Willem Dufoe is great as Norman Osborne and plays two separate characters simultaneously which is very impressive. 4. Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris do great jobs as Uncle Ben and Aunt May respectively. 5. JK Simmons does a fantastic job as J Jonah Jameson, and is my favourite character. 6. I love the costume and set design. 7. Stan Lee's cameo can never be insulted. 8. Pretty decent story and a good opener for the series. 9. The villain, Green Goblin, was pretty decent. 10. The action was competent. 11. I really liked the scene in New York were the New Yorkers stand against the Green Goblin. Bad: 1. James Franco was pretty poor as Harry Osborne and isn't a career highlight. 2. I didn't like the cinematography. 3. The special effects looked very fake. 4. I also refuse to believe that no one clocked on to Peter's alter ego after he WEBBED a bully in school. 5. Tobey Maguire is not a very good Spider-Man. 6. Green Goblin's reasons for hating Spider-Man and very very weak. You could argue the same for Joker in 'The Dark Knight' but Green Goblin only had reason to hate OsCorp, nothing else. 5/10
8.0~One of the best comic book adaptations ever wnterstar Sign in Permalink This movie surprised me in several ways. First of all, it was the first movie I saw Toby McGuire in. He shows that he is a talented, versatile actor. Secondly, this is the first movie I saw Kirsten Dunst play an adult. I remember her as Claudia in "Interview with a Vampire". She has matured as an actress nicely. Thirdly, I've always know that Willem DeFoe is a great actor, but the scene where he is talking to the goblin in the mirror was fantastic. The story is riveting and entertaining, the cinematography and special effects are spectacular. But the acting is what made this movie great. Everyone, from the main players to the minor characters were great in this movie. They treated the movie with respect, rather than making it a cartoon. It is a thoroughly enjoyable movie.
2.0~Disappointingly far from the original thing bithok Sign in Permalink This is not the spiderman which adventures I used to read, 15 to 20 years ago, this is just another american block buster. Despite an outstanding music (you just can't deny Danny Elfman's talent), you will wait a long time until something funny or breathtaking happens... And it won't. This Peter Parker is not half-nerdy as the one I read about was, he spends a long time learning his own skills instead of going out to save lives, he fights against his college friend Flash Thompson while the original one would just hide his powers. He refuses MJ's love at the end while Peter Parker was just dying for her... So what ? They modified the plot, the hero, even Aunt May is not the same kind as in the original books : she's strong and red-blooded while the original one was thin and sweet. Spider-Man is IMHO not DVD-able, I can't risk wasting 2 hours one more time in front of such a bad movie. But if you loved the X-Men movie, you may then adore this one.
8.0~J.K. Simmons Turns In AWESOME Performance as J. Jonah Jameson Poopdeck90210 Sign in Permalink I know it is a little early to be thinking about the 2003 annual academy awards, but I hope the "Academy" considers seriously the wonderful and very juicy performance of J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah (the city editor of the newspaper) in this film. Wow! I hope we see more of Mr. Simmons in upcoming years -- I have high expectations! As far as the rest of the film, I thought the trailer had the best action sequences, which seemed to take a long time to finally get to. Pick up the pace a bit in the next film. And show us more of Kirsten Dunce!
7.0~Good Film indigo997 Sign in Permalink They did a really good job with the characters in this film. Dunst was great as the love interest. My only complaint is that the flying and fight sequences look a little too animated (apparently the same guy did these as did the Batman flicks). Tobey was a good pick for the role, and I'll be glad when the sequel comes out.
10.0~Knowing the story it was still great madman381 Sign in Permalink Besides the amazing visual graphics in the movie, which to the exclusion on scene was truly amazing, the film offered so much more. Having been an avid fan of Spider Man cartoons and comic books, I was worried they wouldn't do a good job telling the story, the case in the Bat Man films. These fears were for nothing. The story telling was supperb, and including the wrestling, along all the little details of his discovering his spider powers was done perfectly. While some changes were made to keep the film modern, like the spider being geneticly enginered instead of radioactive, and removing his first girl friend who does get killed by the Green Goblin which was done for the sake of time. Everything was great. Hope to see the next when Harry becomes the green goblin, or fighting the Hob Goblin, or King Pin, and Simbiat, or Dr. Octopus.
9.0~My favorite comic book character brought to life mymtproject Sign in Permalink 2002's SPIDER-MAN is a marvelous telling of my favorite comic book character. When I first heard that Spidey was getting his own movie back in the early 2000's, I was skeptical that the feat could be pulled off. Thanks to the wonders of CGI, strong character casting and good directing from Sam Rami (a guy familiar with the source material), SPIDER-MAN was everything I dreamed it could be! Tobey MaGuire and William Dafoe feel perfect in their roles of Spider-man and his arch-enemy, Green Goblin. JK Simmons as J.J. Jameson is one of the more entertaining characters from comic book movies this past decade. He captures the cigar-chomping, sarcastic Daily Bugle editor in grand fashion! Other supporting casts are good as well, with James Franco as Harry Osborne, Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson and Cliff Roberson as Uncle Ben. You feel like you're swinging between buildings and dodging pumpkin bombs lobbed at you from Goblin's glider in the action sequences. The story line is easy to follow, has heart and is just plain fun! This one is in my DVD collection. It's not perfect but certainly close; a definite 9 out of 10 stars!
9.0~The most fun I've had in a movie theater, Guys... J-Bolt Sign in Permalink Stan and the rest of the Guys/Gals at Marvel... I am impressed. With this film, I do believe that you guys whooped DC's butt in Hollywood. I have never had so much fun watching a movie in my lifetime, so far. That fun was to the extent of the first hour and 20 minutes seemed only like the 20 minutes, because I was so into the film. Of course I still did not like Green Goblin not looking like his comic book counter-part along with Aunt May/Uncle Ben being the only characters (AND the most unlikely ones, at that) to cuss. By the way, why did you guys edit out Peter telling Norman Osborn that his parents were killed when he was 4? A lot of people in the theater, who didn't know Spidey, were really confused as to why Pete lived with his Aunt/Uncle. All-in-all, I had to rate this film a definite 9/10. If not for what I described as the faults, I would've given it a perfect 10 on the spot. Hopefully, Spider-man 2 will have some other characters in it...I'm thinking the Venom, Carnage and Separation Anxiety series (with Black Cat involved) would be a GREAT sequel, ending up as it's own film story. Keep up the good work, Guys. J-Bolt Lightning Bolt Entertainment
2.0~Kirsten has a block-head gabridl Sign in Permalink Spider-Man (don't you love that nineteenth-century hyphenation) entertains mainly through its special effects. These last about 2% of the film. The remainder of the movie looks like stuff I used to watch on TV during the 70s. Toby Maguire sounds and poses and hops like a toad, and Kirsten tries to summon up the enthusiasm to kiss him. It's sad that film has sunk so low that even comic books are more sophisticated.
8.0~Oh My God!!!!! bullseyez Sign in Permalink I just don't know what to say about this movie. i've already seen this movie three times now and every time i'd come out of the cinema I was utterly surprised about the excellence of this movie. YOU WILL GET CAUGHT IN THE WEB! The storyline is great, the chemistry between Tobey and Kirsten is really good, the action-scenes are over the top although i think most people would expect more of that. But that doesn't mean the movie gets boring. Far from it. I believe most people will agree with me on this movie.(That the movie can be found in the top 250 explains why) So don't hesitate for a second and see this one. You won't be disappointed
9.0~Doooope! smokedout_24_7 Sign in Permalink This movie is DOPE! The special effects rocked, the cast is perfect, the costume design is awesome, and it's packed with action AND humor! The only thing that i noticed that wasnt the same as the comics, is the web. Anyone who has read the comics and seen this movie knows what i'm talking about. Other than that though, this movie matched the comics to a T. I honestly don't think they could have done any better on this movie, unless of course that had been able to keep the scene of Spiderman climbing the WTC. This movie is DEFINATELY worth the time and money of anyone into romance, comedy, and action flix (let alone the Spiderman comics).
8.0~Blockbusters are Back!!!!!!!! super_keeper Sign in Permalink Having grown up on the classic event blockbusters of the 70s and 80s like Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Back to the Future et al and then having to sit through the 90s blockbuster tosh (Godzilla and Batman and Robin come to mind) this film has everything I could wish for. First the characters, Maguire is perfect as Peter Parker the reluctant hero who we can all root for, he grounds the character so well that you feel a much greater connection to him than say Bruce Wayne as Batman. Dunst plays Mary Jane as everything the girl next door should be; smart and sexy but never too far out of reach, it's easy to see why Peter obsesses about her. Their romance never feels tacked on (unlike The Matrix or Lord of the Rings) and the dialogue walks the fine line between sweet and corny very well, its played with so much charm and heart that even the most granite hearted cynic will be suckered by it (how it should've been in Attack of the Clones). Dafoe as Norman Osborn is one of the best baddies for years, his menacing expression is so good he's less scary in costume. But he also gives his character depth never forgetting his human side, the strained relationship he has with Harry is believable and not over done. The confrontation between the Goblin and Osborn in the mirror is like OTT Shakespeare but it keeps right in the spirit of things. The support is bang on too, Aunt May and Uncle Ben dispense their philosophies with out sounding cheesy (in any other situation they would be) and Franco gives Harry Osborn more depth than it first appears and the relationships he has with his dad and Peter are more interesting than they should be. J.K Simmons is brilliant as J.J.Jameson, giving one of the best comic relief performances in years. The story is simple and by concentrating more on the characters the film appears richer than most blockbusters (even Lord of the Rings). When the action takes place it might not be visually stunning but it feels more important than the eye candy from the Matrix or Attack of the Clones, the final showdown has more in common with Fight Club. The film feels like it was lifted straight form the pages of a comic book, at some points you could pause the film and put it straight into print. It's the same with the dialogue with lines like 'We'll meet again Spider-man' and 'I could crush you like a bug' fitting perfectly with the atmosphere of the movie and never sounding ridiculous. This movie gives you the over excited feeling the new Star Wars films try and fail to create. This and Lord of the Rings are the only action-adventures of the past decade that stand up to the old school classics of 10 to 20 years ago and is probably in my top ten blockbusters of all-time. 9/10.
4.0~Disappointing to the point of being poor gary_loftus Sign in Permalink SPOILERS ALERT! I have to say I really did not enjoy this film very much. While the general ideas were good the execution was extremely poor. First, the positives:- The story was very true to the comics and no real liberties were taken. Willem Dafoe was very good as the Goblin ( even if the character, like most of the others, was very poorly fleshed out and realised ). Unfortunately that is all the positive things I can say about the film. Now, the negatives:- My first, and main, criticism of the film is it's pacing. The film never feels settled. It tries so hard to add deep, meaningful scenes to the characters that it rushes through the action sequences and their consequences ( the first moment that the Goblin appears must last about 30 seconds and leaves you totally bewildered ). Second, the deep meaningful scenes feel very false with poor acting, probably due to the awful script. The final scene, while working nicely in terms of the storyline in regard to the comics, feels very flat and totally out of place ( as do most of the scenes between Mary Jane and Peter Parker ). And, for a film with so many scenes the lesser characters are poorly fleshed out ( Harry Osbourne and Aunt May in particular ). The only relationship I thought was well executed was that between Peter Parker and Uncle Ben. Next I have to criticise most of the acting, Tobey Macguire in particular. The scene where he is mourning his Uncle's death is simply him sitting on his bed with glycerine in his eyes looking slightly morose and reading his lines. Finally, I felt the CGI scenes were poorly done, looking blatantly obviously like CGI characters ( Spiderman in particular ). I sincerely hope that the productions of Daredevil and The Hulk are not using the same special effects company. I really wanted to enjoy this film. I was very excited to hear that Marvel were finally getting big productions of their characters and after the brilliant X-Men I had very high hopes for this, but I am afraid that Sam Raimi and co. have let me down. Here's hoping Daredevil and The Hulk can make up for it!
10.0~I'm Addicted!!! :) spidey_girl84 Sign in Permalink I know there are ppl here that may consider this to be downright freaky, but I've seen "Spider-Man" eight times, and each time I saw it, I was blown away. The special effects, admittedly, WERE a little corny [the ones on the "Star Trek" movies are much better], but everything else was great! Tobey Maguire is very believable as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He really brought the role of the romantically challenged superhero to life [plus, he looked really HOT with his shirt off the morning after he was bitten by the spider!!! :)]. On the slim chance that anyone reading this hasn't seen the movie, my only remaining comments about this movie are: I love it, I hope everyone else likes it, it is, at this moment, my absolute favorite movie of 2002, it's DEFINITELY at the top of my list of movies to buy, and it gets a rating of "excellent" in my book. Enjoy!!!
10.0~SPECTACULAR! I felt like a kid again, reading the comic for the very first time, this is possibly the best comic book movie yet! TURKEYHED Sign in Permalink The directing, the special effects, the casting, everything was perfect. You simply can't ask for more than this in a comic book movie. Not since "Batman" was I this moved and captivated in the theater, in fact, even more so. It's easy to get lost in this film. Simply Amazing, a huge pay off for fans.
10.0~Comic adventures don't get any better!! Doddi Sign in Permalink Since early childhood my vague memory of seeing actual Spiderman film has troubled me since the talks of this big screen version began. Not until now did I wanna check fully out why I felt so sure about seeing a movie before. My answer was: Movie made for TV - The Amazing Spider-man. So, relieved and sure I wasn't crazy I went with an open mind on the first big screen version of Spiderman and boy oh boy: it was everything I would have wanted from a comic book adventure put onto screen. One fault (better to deal with that first!): The soundtrack didn't capture me right away but maybe it will later. Danny Elfman is of course the master of tunes and his score for Batman and Batman Returns and his best Edward Scissorhands (along with Men in Black) made him for me the best choice for Spider-Man. Thank God, he was chosen. Sam Raimi was not very known to me but when I heard James Cameron might do it, I got interested since I loved Titanic so much. Again, Raimi didn't interest me much but that surely paid off when I saw the picture because I don't believe James Cameron or anybody could have done it better. Sam Raimi, for what it's worth: Thank you for the best comic book adventure put on screen! Kirsten Dunst and Willem Dafoe were great choices. Two great actors with great movies behind them. Tobey Maguire has been a light favourite after seeing him in Pleasantville but as Spider-Man ...??? I never would have guessed - and again it pays off because it is so credible. I couldn't imagine any other doing the same perfect justice to the Peter Parker/Spider-Man double life. For me, though, this first Spider-Man movie, is an offer first and foremest for what is about to come. The character development, esp. for Spiderman/Peter Parker was necessary here and Mary Jane as well. So I look forward for the future. Somehow I also find Spider-man to be the most believable of all these cartoon heroes - why? Don't know! To sum it up: special effects, sets, cinematography... so brilliant. Storyline: great, but some side-characters weren't great enough...if you know what I mean. Acting: great, perfect in Tobey's case. Music: great. Directing: I'm just sorry for doubting Sam Raimi so much - no one could have done it better. Well, it doesn't get much better than this. - Doddi
6.0~Not good as I expected guidomaschio Sign in Permalink It was a nice try .. but it could have been better. Things I didn't like: 1)Peter Parker seems to be always smiling while I remembered from the comics that he was a troubled and worried person. 2)Goblin costume isn't scaring as I expected (altough Mr. Dafoe does an excellent job because he is scary while he doesn't wear this mis-combined costume) 3)Why did they decide to kill the Goblin character? 4)Mr.JJ Jameson is not funny as he was in the comics. Things I liked: 1) Mr. Dafoe's playing 2) Some FX (but not all of them) vote 6/10
10.0~Best movie I've seen in a long time... Parker Quinn Sign in Permalink When I first heard that a Spiderman movie was being made I knew I had to see it. Of course I heard that it was being made when I was in high school and that was 11 years ago. All I have to say is that it was worth the wait! From the opening credits to the final scene (poor Mary-Jane) I was enthraled with all of the characters. Initially, I wasn't sure about Tobey Maguire but after seeing him chasing the bus, being tripped in the aisle and generally teased he was the perfect choice. His transition from the geek to the strongman is evident enough to notice but slow and subtle enough to believe that it's gradual. There's so much that can be said about this movie but I think it speaks for itself. Volumes in fact. I haven't been to a movie that I wanted to buy even before I walked out of the theatre in a long time but this one is mine for sure when it comes out. If you haven't seen it, go, now, waste no more time. It's definately a movie that should be seen in the theatre at least once if not twice or three or ten or twenty times. All this from a lousy Spiderbite!
10.0~Movie Entertainment at its BEST marnie1310 Sign in Permalink I am really not into super hero type movies, never liking Superman and Batman films. However, this movie is spectacular, perfect casting especially Spidey himself.... I loved it from start to finish including the CGIs and the absurd baddie. I just can't wait to own it on DVD and watch it over and over again...roll on Spiderman 2.
10.0~Radical Feminist will hate this movie...... the___force Sign in Permalink I just wanted to let all women know that Spider-Man is a superb movie, and for all normal, non-radical women it will be a very enjoyable experience. However, if you are a radical feminist who gets whipped up into a state of rage whenever you see a movie where a female character is saved by a male character - and that male character is not a lazy, immoral jerk - then don't bother because your not going to like this movie. Let me assure all women right now that neither Spider-Man nor any other super-hero movie are a conspiracy to oppress women, as some people who have written comments on this web site have suggested. (You'll know the comments I'm talking about when you see them). Like I said, some people see conspiracies everywhere, and some people just hate any movie that promotes morality of any kind. I highly recommend this movie to all women, who I hope will judge for themselves whether this movie is offensive to them, and not let radical feminists judge it for them.
10.0~Your Friendly Neighborhood Spiderman Strikes Again LadyOfSherwood Sign in Permalink Let me begin by...WOW this was a GREAT movie!! Tobey Maguire made a great Spider-Man/Peter Parker; he portrayed it SO well! Kirsten Dunst rocked the screen as Mary Jane Watson. Even James Franco as Harry Osbourne was great! And Willem Dafoe...talk about chilling! He had the Green Goblin laugh down to a science! I got chills every time he was on the screen. Rosemary Harris made a sweet Aunt May, and Cliff Robertson, a great Uncle Ben. You really felt the connection between the Parkers. Also, the soundtrack was great! It had the original theme, as well as one covered by Aerosmith, and some great rock tracks! This is definitely a must-see movie, and I urge you all to see it. This is spideychick, signing off!
10.0~Best spiderman movie pratham048 Sign in Permalink Now, there are so many spiderman movies out there but this movie holds a good place in my heart becoz i just watched it when i was a kid and i had so many memories with it. And now when i rewatched it , it is really good the acting , story and vfx ,cgi is really on point. U should watch this movie if u haven't becoz it worth it.
7.0~A Great Tobey, Much Fine Acting, but M.J. Needs Those Acting Lessons ilikeimdb Sign in Permalink Enjoyed Spider-Man, mostly for the nuanced performance of Tobey M. Willem Dafoe was a perfect villain, with comic touches appropriate to the overall theme of the movie. Unfortunately, Ms. Dunst *really* needs to follow through on getting her acting lessons, as her M.J. character suggests. Her delivery is so wooden, so flat, it's inappropriately hilarious. How could Spidey be in love with a stacked piece of redheaded cardboard? There's no chemistry there whatsoever and it's to Tobey's credit he faked it for her the whole time. PlayStation-like animation detracts from some of the scenes, but the sweeping cinematography thrills at every angle (despite the twin towers' removal).
9.0~perhaps the best comic adaptation of all time. stealth1ninja Sign in Permalink This movie was spectacular. I've always been an avid follower of the spiderman mythos, and this captures all the important elements perfectly. The comic was followed fairly faithfully, and all the action scenes with spidey make it feel like a live spiderman comic book. Loved the depictions of spidey's style of fighting, and his comic poses were very accurate! The minor changes to the spidey universe did not detract from the movie at all. The screenplay covered quite a bit of spidey history, and incorporated MANY well known storylines. Impressive that so many years of history could be condensed and streamlined into about 2 hours. As a comic adaptation, this is as good as it gets. The people who nitpicked about EVERYTHING obviously missed the point. This movie is not an art film. It is a superhero movie. Of course things will be cliche...it's supposed to be like a comic book for god sakes! Yes, there were things that could have been improved...and a few scenes where people seemed to just read the lines...but overall, the character development was good, the personalities of the characters true to the comics, and the casting very well done. Willem Dafoe's schizoid performance at the mirror was great! The Uncle Ben section was very moving. Aunt May and JJ Jameson were PERFECTLY characterized. Kirsten Dunst played a very sweet and beautiful Mary Jane. Tobey had the nerdy Peter Parker down, and his spiderman looked very good. The gimpy Goblin costume could've been better though. He looked a lot like a power ranger villain...which I think often detracted from his credibility. Perhaps a better mask would have helped. Overall, as a movie on its own, this movie is about average or above average, which is not bad at all. 3.5 out of 5. As a comic adaptation, it is very good, and captured everything that made the comics so enjoyable. The best and most accurate adaptation in ages, if not of all time. 4.5 out of 5. This movie will make you believe that there is a spiderman. It is definately the best movie out right now, and I highly recommend it. Great fun, and worth seeing more than once.
10.0~Amazing JanetSnakehole3 Sign in Permalink I loved this movie, it had it all, action, romance, humor, everything that movie needs. Ending is surpising. I just loved it. I cant wait till its available on DVD. Only negative thing about movie is actor Willem Dafoe who played Green Goblin, he didnt do good job at all, and if you see the movie you'll see why.
7.0~Surprisingly enjoyable mattymatt4ever Sign in Permalink Before I go on, I'd like to establish that I had no intention on seeing this movie in the first place. I've never read the Spiderman comics, and I didn't buy my tickets in advance. Of course, I've heard of Spiderman in the past, but I didn't know anything about his superpowers, arch enemies, etc. prior to this movie. And guess what? I was very impressed! Tobey Maguire is a fine actor, but I wasn't sure how he'd fill the shoes of a landmark superhero. Playing Homer in "Cider House" is a lot different from playing Peter Parker in "Spider-Man." But he is totally convincing in the lead role, and I can tell he worked out a lot to prepare for this role. Kirsten Dunst is...well...her beautiful self. She flashes her beautiful smile, going through the motions as the helpless victim. Sure, she did a fine job, but she didn't have much to work with. The great Willem Dafoe steals the movie as scientist Norman Osborn who later turns into Spidey's arch enemy, The Green Goblin. Dafoe is perfectly fiendish, as always. I had no idea he was going to be in the cast, prior to seeing the movie, so I was very impressed to see him pop up on screen. Cliff Robertson is great as Parker's uncle. And, I forgot the actor's name, but the guy who played Jameson is also a scene-stealer. I loved his scenes, which were reminiscent of the fast-talking farces of the old days. There's a lot of action, a lot of excitement, good special effects and touches of humor to boot. I can't complain. The plot is by-the-numbers superhero fare, and there are no real surprises. Nevertheless, I was entertained throughout and not a minute left me unsatisfied. In a way, "Spider-Man" brought out the kid in me, but even the most discerning adult viewers should be impressed. Trust me. This is one big-budget summer blockbuster in which I can honestly say it was worth every buck! My score: 7 (out of 10)
9.0~Great movie but Spiderman 2 is far superior gangstahippie Sign in Permalink Rated PG-13 for stylized violence and action. Spiderman came out in 2002.When I first saw it, it was excellent, I mean it was a really good superhero movie about my favorite superhero.Then in 2004, there was Spiderman 2.That film was much much better.Almost everything about it was better.But this is still an awesome film and its worth checking out even if you have seen Spiderman 2.The film shows the origins of Peter Parker,how he got bitten by a radio active spider and how he became spiderman, the superhero with amazing abilities.Now there is this villain named the green goblin who spiderman must stop.The Green Goblin is a cool villain in this film.Spiderman is a good superhero movie though Spiderman 2 is much better.I didn't see Spiderman 3 yet.
6.0~Big Budget B Movie mrgray83 Sign in Permalink This film has raked in a truckload of cash and a score of great reviews. Well, it seems that I'll have to be the exception. I didn't contribute one cent to this film's theatrical release and I am not about to write a glowing review of it. Spiderman is without a doubt one of the funniest unintentional comedies I have ever come across. This film has some of the most unbelievable dialog that has ever been put to film. It doesn't quite border on Ed Wood quality but it's the thing that keeps me laughing through the whole thing. The acting was so so but I don't blame the actors too much. With dialog that bad, the script couldn't have been much to jump up and down about. I wouldn't recommend this unless you like the 'so bad it's good' films like I do. And also there are some nice shots of Kirsten Dunce scattered throughout. 6/10
1.0~A decent movie, doesn't deserve top 250 slot Lans_Ender Sign in Permalink This movie is worth viewing while at the same time is undeserving of a top 250 slot. Kirsten Dunst was amazing in this movie. It was a new type of role for her. Tobey Maguire was good, I expect to see him in some more upcoming movies. The problem in this movie revolved around Willem Dafoe's character. Willem Dafoe is a good actor but some parts of his character are unbelievable. Also, the Green Goblin's mask looked like something out of Power Rangers. They should have made it cloth. The computer effects were good, all in all a 7. Do see this movie, but don't expect it to be one of the best videos ever.
8.0~Not the start but certainly a help Kempywood Sign in Permalink Working in a movie theater as I used to do you grow to loathe certain movies releases not because you don't like the movie, in some cases you cannot wait to see the movie, the only problem with blockbuster movies (Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings etc) is the increase and business and therefore increase of work, except where I used to work in the only theater that nobody except myself and a select few used to actually do anything! Spiderman was one of such movies that was expected to explode and cause such frustrations how right were we. Especially when in England it was a 12 rated movie meaning nobody under that age could see it (Spiderman was of course the movie that brought around the new 12a certificate which also led to the movie being rerun.) Tobey Maguire is Peter Parker, the school know-it-all who just happens to be in love with his neighbor, Mary-Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) the most popular girl in school. Not all is well, because of his brains he is constantly teased by the jocks and nothing can go his way. When his science class goes to a research center one day he is taken aback by the incredible displays of a genetically modified spider, one that has the unique aspects of a whole host of different spiders and as his whole class marvels at the ten blue and red arachnids Peter notices one is missing. Now as the year book photographer he was to take photos of M-J posing by the spiders when the missing eight legged freak (sorry not too keen on spiders after I found two black widows in my pool whilst my 14 month old daughter was in there) webs down from the ceiling and plants a bite on the hand of the soon to be valedictorian. Many changes begin to take place, Peters body becomes more buff and he no longer needs his glasses add to the fact that somehow he's able to know when something is about to hit him and Parker starts to become very confused but also excited by his new found powers. To say his ideas were to fight crime straight away would be well..a lie. His whole reason for the red and blue suit was to win a wrestling match to make money for a car. When the promoter screws him he decides that the robbery that takes place of the promoters money just seconds later is nothing to do with him. Then it all starts to change, Uncle Ben is killed and suddenly Peter wants to take revenge and use his powers for the good of making sure nobody else is in that position again. Add to the fact that his best friends father also suddenly gets powers and goes insane to become the Green goblin (Willem Dafoe) and you get what by most at least is still described as the best super hero movie around right now. Of course this movie has already spawned a sequel and probably more to follow, not only that but it has helped forge the release of other superhero movies (Dare Devil, Fantastic Four, Superman Returns and Batman Begins) Whether the trend will remain or not you can see Spiderman staying around for a fair while.
4.0~DON'T BELIEVE THE SPIN kevin c Sign in Permalink Maguire is perfectly cast as Parkey/Spidey, and the first hour of this film are excellent. The college and wrestling scenes are really funny. Dunst is beautiful, and the newspaper editor nearly steals the film. The 2nd half is a bit of a disappointment. The action is quite flat. The ending (with a 9/11 nod) will make you want to puke. The Green Goblin might be faithful to the comics, but he's a joke. Your foe should either be evil, scary or charismatic.
8.0~One of the best films of 2002. . . Casey_Moriarty Sign in Permalink This movie is great. It features a truly brilliant performance by Tobey Maguire, as a character you can truly identify with. The supporting performances are great, and the chemistry between the actors is perfect. The action is great. I'm really tired of people saying that the action scenes were stolen from or inspired by the Matrix. Nothing could be further from the truth. The action was taken from the comic books. The Matrix, in fact, was heavily inspired by the Spider-Man comics among others. The only thing that really bothered me about this movie was the villain. Dafoe is great, but the Green Goblin is simply a crummy villain, with no depth or anything. But overall, highly recommended! See it now! Sam Raimi is a genius!
7.0~Refreshingly different janeroo Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is such a pleasant surprise... Raimi kept it low key instead of going for the glitzy, over the top, gratuitous special effects. Seeing Peter Parker clumsily stumble into becoming Spider-Man is like seeing the likeable chump who can never catch a break win the lottery. That's what audiences want to see -- a fantasy they can relate to. Whether they'll admit it or not, there are many young men out there who've just seen this movie secretly hoping they'll be bitten by a mysterious spider... and hook up with Kirsten Dunst, too of course :-) Aside from being a tad slow toward the end (with about 3 grand finales), it was nicely paced and fun to watch.
3.0~Lame... diverse_izzue Sign in Permalink This movie is ranked second on my worst-ever list - only "Battlefield Earth" is topping this. The story is absolutely lame and predictable. This is pure Hollywood-Trash, but whereas other 200 Million $ Movies are at least interesting or impressive, Spider Man is just ridiculous. Tobey Maguire and James Franco did a really well Job though - what a pity Maguire plans to make another two movies of the Spiderman series!
9.0~Shh kiddo....Mommy and Daddy are talking now. bman-ky Sign in Permalink What a work of art! We can definitely see Stan Lee's hands all over this project. From Spidey's quips, to the drama of the Norman Osborne's "Other Personality" this is perhaps the BEST comic book to Movie translation I've ever seen. If your a True Believer however, you may find a FEW, and I do mean a few, problems. #1 for me was the Web Shooters. As we all know, Parker built his web-shooters, and mixed his own "web fluid". Not so in the movie, now they're part of his genetic enhancement. #2 "With Great Power comes Great Responsibility" Great line, but I feel that the director's REALLY wanted it in a specific part at a specific time. It wasn't used very well, and left me going "Where did that come from." Overall, one of the best movies of the year. I loved watching Spidey "learn" how to use his powers, and how he goes from Peter Parker to Spiderman. The comic book is followed religiously in alot of parts, and for this we can all be thankful. The CGI was masterful, and the acting on the part of Tobey McGuire was superb. Long live the Amazing Spider Man.
9.0~Great Film, Some of Marvel's Best, lesleyharris30 Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is a terrific film. The Spider-Man trilogy (Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3) is truly Marvel at their best, although I'm not so sure how the reboot coming next year is going to be. They're starting all over again with a new actor, that totally won't replace Tobey Maguire, and they're calling it The Amazing Spider-Man, maybe it could be good, but definitely not as good. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is bitten by a spider during a field trip that gives him super spider powers and his personality starts to change. He becomes more confident, less of a nerd, and his secret crush Mary Jane starts to notice him. When he decides to use his powers for good as Spider-Man, he gains a new enemy, the Green Goblin, who is actually his best friend Harry's father.
9.0~"I'm Batman..." cordaro9418 Sign in Permalink When Batman spoke that answer to a scared thug in 1989 he dealt a blow for every Comic character, not just the Warner's backed DC characters, to the major studios in saying 'We belong here.'... Unfortunately for Marvel, they couldn't compete till now. Sure, 'Blade' came off huge, but very different than his comic origins though for the better. 'X-Men' was a surprise hit and great comic book film, again, if not following the comic lore page by page. 'Spider-Man' does so nearly panel for panel right from a grand splash page. Updated for the times, the story still holds true. "With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility..." and the film conveys Stan Lee's basic message with oomph. In true Marvel fashion, not over the top or straying from the character, it hits home. A normal teenager dealing with extraordinary circumstances and walking the high wire ever so carefully along the way. Perhaps the most cinematic anti-stereotypical ending in film as Boy meets Girl, Boy chases Girl, Boy saves Girl, Boy rejects Girl!!? Yes, that one closing scene where Peter turns from not only Mary Jane but from a part of himself indeed epitomizes what Comic Heroes have done for nearly 70 years... sacrifice. And in one instant, it is made clear. Perhaps the perfect Comic to Film example... where 'Batman Begins' was 90% dead on, 'Spidey' reaches 99%. With this film, its not Marvel vs. DC but another example, a shining example, of 'We belong here.'... 'Nuff Said.
9.0~Spider Man patrickjd-47829 Sign in Permalink Spider-Man an iconic name that has stuck with me since I was 4. Back then I would love anything with the name Spider-Man and as soon as I saw this movie I was mind blown, everything from the pictures the acting I was drawn from start to finish. And while now I see more of the flaws or rather the one flaw I had with the movie. The villan. As a kid and still only now being young I expect allot from a villain as in more movies nowadays I see that you can either make a movie great or bad with just the fleshing out of villains something that made suicide squad very disappointing as that what the movie relied on and while many probably will disagree I did not like the villain in this movie. Why? Well a villain is supposed to make new schemes but not this one, seeing the same strategy of fighting from the beginning to almost the end was hard as it made the movies action side feel bland looking at it now. But back at the time the action was very greatly shot as the cgi to just how the script was planned out is brilliant to me which is why I'm going to give Spider-Man a: A
8.0~My Spidey Senses Are Tingling!!!! FilmFanInTheHouse Sign in Permalink Spider-Man (2002, Dir. Sam Raimi) On a school field trip, Peter Parker is bitten by a genetically modified spider. He wakes up the next morning with incredible powers. After witnessing the death of his uncle, Parkers decides to put his new skills to use in order to rid the city of evil, but someone else has other plans. The Green Goblin sees Spider-Man as a threat and must dispose of him. Even if it means the Goblin has to target Parker's Aunt and the girl he secretly pines for. As the world moved into the 21st Century, Superhero movies wasn't very popular on the big screen. Both the Batman and Superman series had been created and died, and X-Men had only recently began as a series. Now, Spider-Man was being brought to the big screen for the first time, and it's perfect in every way. The cast is perfect. Tobey Maguire can easily fit into the nerdy role of Peter Parker and brings a convincing turn as Super-Man. Kirsten Dunst is a great Mary Jane, and really brings the romantic side of the film in. Willem Dafoe is a sinister Green Goblin and you can see that he is really enjoying the role. James Franco was well cast and look likes Dafoe's son. The story is very well written and doesn't drag on, and although there are a few odd shots, the CGI is very impressive. This is a definitely one superhero movie which must be seen. "He's saved my life twice and i've never even see his face." - Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst)
9.0~Spider-Man Best Ever KingBrian1 Sign in Permalink Marvel's greatest superhero is given a great film that compliments the talent of Stan Lee. The casting of Tobey Maguire, Williem Dafoe & Kirsten Dunst her best work is a perfect example of Directors picking good celebrities to fill great roles. They all put in memorable performances in this Romance story which was a big part. Peter and Mary Jane was a perfect match together as portrayed, now the material they had to work with the great Spiderman comics helped in creating those characters. Not so the Green Goblin. Dafoe made that character just like Nicolson made the Joker in Tim' Burton's Batman. Instead of a generic bad guy we got a likable schizophrenic who was screwed by the people around in. The film is a comic classic.
6.0~Not quite there.. booboobear1970 Sign in Permalink I realize I am going against the majority here but this film didn't quite do it for me. I have always been an avid fan of Spider-Man and I collected this comic when I was a kid but this film just seemed like it was missing something. Some of the special effects were very distracting and I felt like I was watching a cartoon at times. It's obvious we have come along was since the days of the Spider-Man television series but it just still seemed a little fakey. The main problem I had ,however, was that many of the characters in the film just seemed very bland to me and I really didn't care about them. Although, I think Tobey Macguire is a competent actor and that his understated performances works well in most films I don't feel this was one of them. I would just like to see a little more of the inside of Peter Parker. Overall I would recommend seeing this film because it is neat to see a more realistic Spidey but this doesn't quite rise to the level of Christopher Reeve's first outing as Superman or Michael keaton's outing as Batman. I am hoping that Daredevil and The Incredible Hulk will offer a little bit more and maybe Tobey will kick it up a notch for Spidey 2. 6 out of 10 stars.
9.0~It's Got Magic Hitchcoc Sign in Permalink I remember Spider-man from my youth. I never got into the comics, so I apologize to the true web driven literati. I know the story. And I've watches and read about a lot of superheroes. My son came back from seeing the film, angry and hurt because they took liberties with one of his real loves. I went to it to watch a movie, not to pay homage. I think it's a heck of a good film. To start with, the vertiginous special effects are wonderful. His leaps from building to building are breathtaking. The best part is that Tobey Maguire has a vulnerability that the alter ego needs to have . Like so many, he is reluctant, but forces beyond his control dump him into the middle of things over which he has not control. I'm told the villain is not kosher. The they should have chosen one of his more formidable adversaries. I thought the guy was pretty spooky and set up more of the same. Peter Parker has some unburned bridges heading into the sequel, and that's always fun. There's just a niceness that connects the characters and a bitter world to fight against, including the newsman who has no respect for Peter's talents. I think this movie is thoughtful as well as really exciting.
10.0~wow ataristzx Sign in Permalink I saw this movie Sunday and all I have to say is wow. This movie makes it easily with no effort to the 2nd spot on my top favorite movies ever right in line with the Matrix. This visual elements of this movie were amazing. Tobey Mcguire did an excellent job in playing the part of Peter Parker (spiderman) and was very believable. This movie definitely deserves all the money and attention it is getting. If you haven't seen it go see it right now, this one you just can't miss.
8.0~not just a kiddies super hero film Animal89 Sign in Permalink when my mate first dragged me off to the cinema to see spider-man the movie, i was really not looking forward to it as i was expecting to be watching a kiddies super hero film. i was wrong. spider-man is anything but a kiddies super hero film. its a love story, a tragedy, an action film and a sci-fi all rolled into one with a well chosen cast, clever story line and edge of the art special effects. one of the best things about this film, is that unlike a lot of super hero films, there is no clear line between good and evil, their is no real bad guy and no real good guy. all characters seem to have good sides and bad sides, and different reasons for each. try looking at the story from different characters points of view and you'll see what i mean. 8/10 recommended; to anyone who likes tragedies , love films, action or science fiction. or to fans of the spider-man or marvel comics. not recommended; maybe to very young kids as this is a bit more violent than the cartoon. watch this if you liked; hulk, LXG movie, spider-man series or comics, marvel comics.
7.0~A new type of Superman esteban1747 Sign in Permalink The comics have many heroes, the most famous Tarzan, Superman, Batman and Flash Gordon, the latter the only normal human because the others are people with super powers or with powerful modern means as Batman. These heroes were quite famous during the 40s and 50s, and the less popular was Spider man, a hybrid of Superman, Tarzan and Batman. This film has good special effects, helps to remember a bit of our childhood, good acting of Willem Dafoe, as usual, the villain of the film, but the plot gives nothing new if you are a fan of Superman or Batman.
10.0~The right way akusakuda Sign in Permalink I have just one thing to comment about this Movie, that's the way to do it. I'm a real fan of super heroes, so I always enjoy watching a movie about those, but I hadn't seen a god version since I watch Spidey! -At last a god super heroe movie!-That's what I say You can have fun with a movie, like X-Men(my favorite super heroes team), but the movie is awful! as a real movie version from the comics, no one looks the same (except Xavier). The director gives the impression that to be a super hero is funny...but, anyway, that's not the point, now is time to talk about Spiderman. A complete story, with drama, suspense, love, action, death... You can think whatever you want about the heroe, but you must recognize that Spiderman is the best movie of Super heroes ever done, and movies like Batman, X-Men or Judge Dred are a traition to the original spirit of the comic-book.
8.0~An Untypical Typical Hero Story qli-54365 Sign in Permalink Hero stories are enjoyed by people of all ages. It is common to see a child dressing up and playing as a superhero, or even someone talking about a heroic act done by a neighbor. The superhero genre has been explored inside out, and has become one of the most common type of story. However, Marvel's 2002 Spider-Man rendition of a superhero story twists traditional storytelling clichés to illustrate the hardships and responsibilities that come with power. With likeable and relatable characters played by Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco, Spider-Man is a superhero journey no one should miss. The backstory for Spider-Man is rather common. Peter Parker, a typical high school student, went on a field trip to a science museum and found himself bitten by a spider, which mutated his genes and gave him spider-like abilities such as shooting webs, supernatural senses and reflexes, and enhanced vision. One key scene in displaying his powers was the fight against Flash, the school bully. Peter faces his school bully after accidently spilling a lunch tray on him. With his extraordinary senses, he feels a fly behind him, a spitball released, and Flash's fist coming towards him. He reacted by bending ninety degrees backward and stopping Flash's fist with one hand. The camera angles show Peter's inner monologue, his thought about the slowness of the fist and his own reactions dodging the punches. I like how the movie shows a disbelief even on Peter's face, which lets the audience know that even Peter has just realized his own powers. Unlike other movies where heroes can immediately utilize their abilities after knowing it, Spider-Man shows a transition stage where Peter, just like any other human being, needs time to adjust to the changes. The main character, Peter Parker, is also a likeable character whom the audience can sympathize with easily. In the first scene, the audience sees how average or even weak Peter is, because he first shows up in the movie chasing the bus. We see the insults and mockery thrown at him, and even the bus driver sneers at Peter. When he got on the bus, no one offered him a seat, and in fact, everyone rejects him. To all in the audience who feels insecure or unconfident in themselves, Peter is a character the audience can relate to easily. The characters in Spider-Man are alive. What Spider-Man do better than other typical hero movies is that it portrays its characters as very human and can make wrong decisions. In the Flash fight scene, what really made Peter as a character alive is that he didn't just gloriously beat down Flash, and thought it was the most natural thing in the world, he was surprised himself. In addition, not all people praised Peter one sidedly for taking down the school bully, there are mixed reactions of disbelief, surprise, and fear, one notably from Mary Jane Watson, Peter's crush. Peter's romantic interests add to the humanness of his character. The villains too, show not only their evil intentions, but also their human hearts, like Harry's concern for his son, Norman, or Norman's vow to take revenge on something his father's death. Although the audience know the villains are wrong, it's hard to hate them. Peter makes wrong decisions, ones that are irreversible and would make him regret forever. There is no 'hero saves the day' trope because to Peter, no matter what he does, there was always someone he couldn't save. Peter's mistake originated from his lack of responsibility for his powers. To chase a girl, Peter decided to make money by participating in an underground fighting arena. When the people in charge cheated Peter out of his enemies, Peter decided to let a thief escape. This indirectly caused Uncle Ben, who raised Peter, to be killed when he met the thief. Having the power but not acting to save others and protect others around him made Peter feel guilty. He has a revelation about how heavy his responsibilities are by having his powers. Like Uncle Ben said, "with power comes responsibility", Peter learns to shoulder his new responsibilities through a very sad lesson. I think the lesson of responsibility applies to all who has a position of power or is in a position to change something, like the president, the governor, or policy makers, because even without superpowers, they have powers. They have powers to change people's lives and their habits, so it is necessary to not abuse those powers. With the recent Kavanaugh hearings, I think we all have a grasp about how important people appointed Supreme Court have on deciding our ways of life. Spider-Man conveys that message with an intention to remind us all of our responsibilities and what we can do even without spider powers.
10.0~One of the Best SUPERHERO movies ever! ZMBKLR Sign in Permalink From it's cast to it's story to the SFX, Spider-Man is simply great. It doesn't dissapoint at all, in any way or form. Spider-Man is at time frenetically paced but never loses track that there is a person behind the mask, a person who is a human being. Toby MaGuire is so perfect as Peter Parker/Spider-man it's almost like he walked off the comic book himself. The film stays 99% faithful to the origin and the lesson that with Great Power Comes Great Responsibility. It's just an awesome film of superb craftsmanship. Sam Raimi (who fit his brother Ted as well as Lucy Lawless there in cameos) did one helluva job. I can hardly wait to see Spider-Man 2!
10.0~go see it right now. I am so not kidding. ghostgirl Sign in Permalink Best comic book adaptation since X-Men. Both of those movies have set the bar high for the genre, and hopefully can keep it there for the upcoming Hulk, Daredevil and Fantastic Four. Overall it was amazingly good. The actors were all perfectly cast, and did really good jobs. Others have been saying that the script was weak, but honestly, it totally had a comic book feel to it. Some may interpret that as cheesy, but i think in the context of a comic book movie, it was completely appropriate, and not at all poorly done. And yeah, the goblin looked a little weird, but Willem Dafoe just played such an amazing Goblin that I didn't even care three seconds after they introduced him. So yeah. Go see it! :D
8.0~Pretty good superhero movie. OllieSuave-007 Sign in Permalink I have not read the Spider-Man comics and don't know the character's story or origin, so this movie was the first introduction for me to the superhero. After watching it, even to somebody completely new to the comic book character, it was a pretty good and entertaining movie. Tobey Maguire stars as the nerdy and shy high schooler Peter Parker, who was bitten by a genetically modified spider, turning him into a more muscular and confident man with spider-like abilities that he must use to fight evil and the villainous Green Goblin, all while experiencing a tragedy in his family. Along the way, he attempts to court his high school crush, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). The acting was descent, albeit a little wooden at times, but I think it helped enhance the steady-going plot story. The special effects were neat and there are plenty of action to keep the story entertaining and exciting. I like the movie's motto, "With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility!" I think that message couldn't have resonate with a better character like Peter Parker since has to rise to the occasion after experiencing the rough side of high school, tragedy and competition with his more popular and well-off friend Harry Osborn (James Franco). Overall, an entertaining movie which I think is the best of the three made starring Maguire. Grade B+
10.0~The wait is over, and well worth it! Soltes25 Sign in Permalink The long wait is over, and finally audiences will be able to see Spidey sailing down 5th Avenue. "Spider-Man" not only delivers, but surpasses all expectations. The story is great, the choice of actors is superb, and above all everything looks awesome. Sure the dialogue gets a bit corny at points, but that is expected (and in some cases preferred). The visual effects of this movie are spell-binding. From the opening credits to the final scene, "Spider-Man" is a huge spectacle. I'm not going to get into the plot, but here a few hints while watching (don't worry no spoilers): 1. Look for cameos (I spotted nearly half a dozen) 2. Listen for clues about the sequel. 3. Look closely at who is acting the bit parts of the movie, there are some really cool actors. 4. Make sure you see the film in a sold out crowd in a theatre with great sound (Danny Elfman's music is awesome). 5. Enjoy! It's a great popcorn movie! Stop reading this review, and go out and see "Spider-Man"!!!
10.0~Excellent Movie. Night_8640 Sign in Permalink This movie was an excellent movie that did much more than I thought it could! It was the very first superhero movie that I ever saw and it was such a great movie it got me hooked to Marvel! The idea and the story are both great but also the special effects were good for 2002. This is a movie that I still love watching and watch over and over again. If you are looking for a good superhero movie I would recommend this over many things, such as X-men or even Wolverine. The way they also stuck to the comic storyline was amazing unlike many movies that forget the comic books story. This movie was also was the very best of the three in the series so far. Spiderman 2 was almost as good as this movie but still not the same. Spiderman 3 is the worst of the series and I personally do not like it. But I would still recommend all three of these great movies to people wanting to watch some good films!
3.0~Bad, bad..... bad. DrWorm26 Sign in Permalink The fact is, this film had nothing to offer but action, and the action wasn't good at all. The foreshadowing was so childish it was laughable, and the horrible "Go America" crap they put in since 9/11 made me want to leave the country. There is no possible way this film can be compared to any SW film, TPM included. There is more plot in 3 minutes of a SW film then ever graced the screen while watching S-M.
9.0~A Must-See!!!!!! ghostface18 Sign in Permalink I have never read the Spiderman comics, but I can easily say that this movie is one of the best movies of the year, if not of the 90's. The acting is great, the special effects are fantastic, the length is just right, even the opening credits are fun to watch. The story is set up very well, supported by the talents of Tobey McGuire, Willem Dafoe, and Kirsten Dunst. It is one of those movies, like The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings, where it is a special-effects filled actioner where the movie lived up to its hype. The ONLY complaint I have about the movie is that it does follow the usual superhero cliche basic structure storyline. However, to compensate for that, the way the storyline and actions are carried out is done very well. At first, I would say that the love story was done poorly, however, the way it turned out made room for a sequal. Actually, the way everything turned out made room for a sequal. I would HIGHLY recommend this. It will soon be added to my DVD collection. It IS worth the 8-9 dollars to see at the theatre.
7.0~Webheads rejoice! stevetseitz Sign in Permalink Spiderman has always been one of the most compelling superheroes because of his basic normalcy and goodness. Sam Raimi does a great job of letting the audience know who Peter Parker is and why he does what he does. It is far less of a psychological stretch than the Bruce Wayne/Batman alter-ego. Speaking on the "Dark Knight", I would rate this film on par with the first "Batman" movie. It had decent performances all around, although I didn't feel anyone reached the level of Jack Nicholson's "Joker". Dafoe gives it a shot. Cliff Robertson lends a touch of class to the proceedings. Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast as Peter Parker, he starts out as a good-hearted but nerdy teenager and becomes more and more confident and has a lot of fun with his super-powers.I don't know if the "Green Goblin" was the best choice of villain but it works well for Spidey to have a nemesis that challenges him intellectually and well and physically. We mustn't forget that Peter is highly intelligent and I think a disservice was done by not letting him develop his own we-shooters. Still the movie was fun and should dominate the box-office this weekend.
8.0~Get caught in Spider-man's web! yankeefan2358 Sign in Permalink This movie brings new meaning to the term web-surfing! In a world where the war on terror seems to dominate the headlines, it's good to have a movie where a normal guy can suddenly take charge and stand up for the weak. Tobey Maguire is an adequate Peter Parker and brings a serious and at times comical spin to Spidey's world. Kirsten Dunst is a little dry, but the upside down kiss is amazingly cool and she is a beautiful young woman. Despite some early bumps in the first effect shots of Peter learning to use his powers, the web-slinging sequences are amazing. The soundtrack is one of the best CD's and best soundtracks put together for a movie probably and this film sets up the path of the sequel. Can't complain here! You can relate to Peter and his troubles (especially if you are a teenager!) and he is a very realistic hero. The film is very deliberate- there are no unnessecary explosions or deaths- everything is planned. Goblin takes revenge on those who wronged him, Peter fights in the name of his uncle. All in all, a great movie! Sam Raimi spins quite a tale! "If someone told you I was just your average, ordinary guy, not a care in the world....somebody lied..."- Peter Parker
6.0~Disappointing start to a promising franchise 6/10 The_Wood Sign in Permalink The summer movie season officially starts.....with a THUD. It seemed like a brilliant choice in picking director Sam Raimi to helm the long awaited Spider-Man, but after viewing the film it seems that he may have not been the right man for the job. It's not that Spider-Man is a terrible film, it just seems like there was so much potential that was wasted. The film is missing that frantic energy that should be required of this type of film. Raimi knows how to deliver this energy, see some of his previous films (The Evil Deads, Darkman). Spider-Man is the only film I can think of in recent memory that cost 100+ million dollars yet it looks like it was made for considerably less. The CGI in this film is absolutely atrocious. These effects look like they came right out of the early 90's. For a summer popcorn flick Spider-Man commits cardinal sin #1: it looks cheap. Other major problems: 1 - Laughable costume design for the Goblin. 2 - Dialogue that makes the "yippy" from Episode 1 sound ingenious. 3 - Plot holes: how did Parker go from his Human Spider costume, into his official Spiderman costume? We should have seen him make it. 4 - The same old thing. Do we really need to watch Spider-Man saving children from fires? How many times do we need to see him stop the same bland street muggers? Couldn't the writers think of more unique ways to showcase Spidey's powers? 5 - Takes way too long to develop the dual between the Green Goblin and Spider-Man. 6 - Speaking of the Green Goblin, everything about this character needed to be expanded on. Why is it he wants to destroy the innocents. The most interesting relationship in the entire film, The Goblin and his son, is barely even focussed on. There were things I liked as well. I thought all the casting choices were superb. Thought the final battle could have used some work, but overall it had the goods. I just wanted more from this film, much more. Here's hoping the sequel can correct on some of the areas this film failed. One thing is for certain, there has only been one true Marvel superhero this year, and that's Blade! Give this franchise to Guillermo Del Toro and let him show Raimi how to do a comic book film.
7.0~Fun For Adults And Kids Alike slightlymad22 Sign in Permalink Sam Riami's "Spiderman" is a fun comic book movie, but it is not a great one Plot In A Paragraph: Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy high school student who lives with his Auntie May and Uncle Ben, he hangs about with his best friend (and seemingly only friend) Harry Osborne (James Franco) and lusts after the girl next door Mary Jane Watson (Kristen Dunst) Peter's life is changed for ever when he's bitten by a radio active spider on a school field trip. Once bitten he developed an amazing powers and transforms himself into the superhero Spiderman. Unfortunately Harry's dad Norman Osborne (Willem Defo) has also developed some superpowers and he has transformed himself into the deadly Green Goblin. I had a few problems with this, the first being the menacing Green Goblin looked like a bad guy from the "Power Rangers" TV show and at times you could see his mouth was not moving when dialogue was coming out!! The wisecracking, sarcastic Spidey from the comics is nowhere to be seen. The ending borrowed heavily from the comic book "The Night Gwen Stacey Died" but didn't have the courage to actually go through with killing off a main character. Another problem for me was, I didn't find Maguire's Peter Parker/Spiderman or Dunst's Mary Jane that interesting. Willem Defo and James Franco were much more interesting as the deranged Father and neglected son. Now on to the good parts. Defo and Franco were both very good. The action scenes were well done, and for the most part the CGI is not that obvious. Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris and in particular JK Simmons are very good in their supporting roles. Maguire does well enough in both roles, and Dunst is attractive enough for us to understand Parkers obsession, and she plays a fine damsel in distress. I enjoyed Bruce Campbell, Octavia Spencer and Elizabeth Banks in their small roles. Overall not as good as it could have been, but still enjoyable enough.
6.0~The film's ok, Tobey Maguire is perfect, but the pacing! JJCA Sign in Permalink Action movies come and go, and many of them take their cue for pacing from a roller-coaster ride. Fast, faster and yet more exciting, and then a nice lull to get you ready for the next "drop". This film seems to follow that practice, however the lull periods r..e..a..l..l..y drag. Not only did i notice this, but so did every young child in the theatre. Unfortunately, most of these periods seem to exist when there is interaction tween spidey and kirsten dunst! The most deadly thing in a relationship is boredom, even if it is the audience's boredom. In hindsight, this flaw shows up even as the credits run at the beginning of the film- on and on and on. On the positive side, the action is pretty good, spidey is perfectly cast in tobey maguire, and the whole tone of the film comes off as the comic book genre it really is.
10.0~A Web of Suspense,Action,and Romance Rolled Into One Great Movie! BCochrane80 Sign in Permalink I can't say enough about Spider-Man and what a great movie it was,i can't wait for the squel next year.Tobey Maguire is great as Peter Parker/Spider-Man.i found it to be everything i excepted going into it,and as soon as it hits dvd I plan on owning it.I give it a 10 out of 10.So far the best Movie of 2002!
8.0~Spider-Man Come out to Play! ptwomey Sign in Permalink We moan and groan year in year out at the tripe Hollywood peddle the masses in their supermarket cinemas, and we have every reason to. But it is when they get their Mainstream formula right that they deserve credit, and I for one will pay it when it is due. "Spider-Man" is the Comic Book, Hollywood formula film reality that entertains right to the last frame. Only when the formula works this well can we ignore the often cliché script and unoriginal filmmaking. "Spider-Man" truly is a Saturday Night joy ride that does not fail to deliver. The standard hero formula of Romance, Action, Good vs. Evil, Dark side/Good side gets a good work-out here and unlike the recent "Star Wars Ep2: Attack of the Clones", this film pulls it off with flying colours. Each aspect of the film receives its due and none of it over-powers the show. Now the draw back here is there is nothing original, and if you're a fan of the comic book then you would of read this script before. It is admittedly a no-brainer and to some that is offensive, but if your out to enjoy something without using your noggin' then this film is definitely for you! It is good to see Comic Book converts receiving the respect they deserve and the film will not disappoint long time fans of "Spider-Man". The film is well described as a motion picture comic and is structured in the exact way any off the shelf comic would be. This of course has led to some rather static and short sequences that are often a thorn in an otherwise well structured film. Some sequences are so short that you would question their relevance. However it is all a sideshow and does not damage the film's entertainment value. One of the major reasons this film hits its formula bliss is the superb performance of Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man and Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin. Tobey is a perfect and shy Peter Parker whilst still a perfect Spider-Man, he has an honesty in his performance that drives the audience to like him both as the character and the actor. All the while Willem Dafoe sizzles as the villain and ultimately steels the show; He is scarier without the mask and manages to bring a touch of darkness to a bright green character on a flying board. There is no room for awards here but the job is done and done very well. The Special effects also get top score as the men at the helm have given reality the driving seat and slotted the computer generation in the make-up department. This movie is a classic example of how special effects can be used to add to a production, to make the final gloss rather than become the whole production, as is generally the case. Digital effects still have a long way to come and this film certainly pushed the limits, but it did not cross them and as a result has retained a sense of believability. There are moment s however where the film ruins its own suspended disbelief, mainly in the form of some of the Green Goblins toys, but it is again not enough to disrupt the film as a whole. At the end of it all you have both a rather average film and a perfect entertainment package The question is what your in the mood for? I will certainly add this to my collection for those times when I wish to escape and be entertained and it is for those moments this film is absolutely perfect. 8/10
9.0~Well done Sam Raimi!! dave-774 Sign in Permalink I have nothing but praise for this excellent movie. It is full of great acting by the main players(especially Willem Dafoe),and even though the effects sometimes look false, this does not detract from the film because of the fantastic pace. The film also closely follows the plot of the comics which is an added bonus, and there are some really nice touches when Spidey is learning to use his powers(when trying to shoot his web for the first time he shouts 'go web', 'shazam!', 'up and away web' etc). All in all this wipes the floor with the Batman films and is the BEST SUPER HERO MOVIE OF ALL TIME. Well done Sam Raimi!!
1.0~Pathetic money grab hpwayne Sign in Permalink This movie had lousy dialog, a lousy story line, a lousy villain with no depth whatsoever, and was designed from start to finish to relieve the public of their money. The movie was more like a pilot for a TV show, and was an obvious setup for sequels to come.
4.0~READ THIS BEFORE SEEING THIS MOVIE Barry Norman Sign in Permalink I have read a lot of reviews of this movie and to be honest I was expecting a lot more than what was on offer. Tobey Maguire plays a decent part and should go on to do the others quite well. On the other hand Willem Dafoe I thought was awful. He wasn't evil enough. I couldn't take him seriously at all. He was funny but unintentionally which was a shame because I was anticipating a lot more from him as an actor. The film felt like an introduction. It was more of a taster of things to come. I thought Star Wars Episode one was like a taste of things to come but this takes the cake. I mean, the whole story basically consists of (slight spoiler coming up!!) Peter wants girl, gets bitten by spider, wakes up next morning as spiderman, starts wrestling, uncle gets killed, wants to put things right, meanwhile father of best friend has turned into physco, not very happy about spiderman, has a fight with him and gets beat. Is anybody sure that somebody's 5-year-old daughter didn't write this? The only other compliant is that almost every single web-slinging scene is in the trailer, so when you watch the film you just get to see the boring bits in between. This film summed up in one sentence is..... Overhyped poorly written love story, nice effects, a few laughs but not all of them intentional.
7.0~Cheesy but it just works tomr-28618 Sign in Permalink This film is enjoyable to watch with great direction from Sam Raimi. The performances are all great, the action scenes are awesome and the score is easily the best Spiderman score. The green goblin is a great villain played very well by Willem Dafoe and is a standout in the film. Some of the visual effects look a bit silly and the overall look of the film isn't great in my opinion but it is still a good film and my second favourite Spiderman film.
10.0~An AMAZING spiderman (dvd) leplatypus Sign in Permalink Reviewing Spiderman makes me learn about a few simple rules about critics: # 1. Critics are subjective, because it is the result between The story and Our story. So Spiderman being my first big moment of entertainment in my childhood, its movie could only be viewed with tolerant eyes. # 2. Adaptation is a success if the «spirit» of the work has been understands. Thus, the pleasure for the fan is to live again this spirit, in front of a lot of little differences from the original work. In Spiderman, the spirit is indeed there: a loyal nephew and friend, a torn soul between his dreams and his duties. And the cast embodies perfectly the characters. # 3. The key to evaluate an adaptation is that not only the fans loves it but also the new comers. And I have got 2 friends who likes Spiderman whereas they didn't even read comics !!!! So, if the Xmen is too complicated for the non-initiated, if Superman is too perfect, if Batman is too dark, Spidey is really the Number one of the super heroes in comics and in movies!!!
9.0~Oh Man, It's about time. koolwave Sign in Permalink Been waiting since I was 12 for this, Sam at first I was worried, but you accomplished a task that Stan himself has to agree, fantastic, no wait, Amazing. True Believer, you are welcome to continue on with more projects from Marvel, don't quit.
10.0~So far looks like the only good movie to come out this summer spidermanfan3377 Sign in Permalink Star Wars 2 was blah, Scooby Doo *sudden onset of shudders*that's not worth the film its printed on-I can tell even without having seen the entire film(God willing I should never board an airplane with that atrocity as the entertainment), the rest of the summer fare looks typical, and even though Anthony Hopkins-one of my fave actors-is in that movie with Chris Rock, I WILL never forgive the producer of that one for his abominable perversion of Pearl Harbor. NEVER. HE will never get a dime from me ever again, and neither will Michael Bay. But I digress; while those films look to range from passable to rotting garbage, Spidey SWINGS. This film is like a blast of innocence, much needed in our jaded, cynical times. It's a terrific summer movie, very well put together, very well acted, which aside from the enormous ads prominently displayed in the Times Square sequence, seems rather wholesome, and pure. Tobey Maguire is great in the lead. He has a sweet, geeky sort of charm along with a terrific body that makes for an agreeable hero. I was with him all the way. Kirsten Dunst makes Peter's crush on her infectious to the male audience members. She is the girlfriend everyone wishes they could have from the way she twirls her hair to her sweet, high laugh-not to mention her adorable smile. William Dafoe is a rather weak villan, and that mask is ridiculous. His best moments are when perfectly calm. As businessman he is sinister, velvet voiced Christopher Walker clone that brings to mind that actor's terrific turn as Max Shreck in Batman Returns. James Franco is barely given time to stretch his acting muscles as Dafoe's son, Harry. But when he does, I have to say he does a good job. The relationship between father and son from the comics is truly brought to life in their brief scenes together. All in all, an ace job. The first time I enjoyed, but the second time-I LOVED it. Without the big crowd, I guess, it's easier to focus on the movie, as opposed to the audiences loud, sudden outbursts. A 10 out of 10.
8.0~stunning effects, nice human drama story, good action dalek69 Sign in Permalink Definitely a top movie, but i must admit i liked starwars ep.2 better. Still, spider-man is spectacular, in effects, stunts and fight- sequences. it also has some good human drama written into it. a must for comic and fantasy fans.
10.0~Definitely Worth My Money LebowskiT1000 Sign in Permalink I first heard this movie was coming out some time back in 2000 or maybe even 1999 and instantly got excited about it. Since then I've tried VERY hard not to OVER-HYPE the movie as not to set myself up for disappointment, and let me tell you, it was TOUGH! Anyhow, so I went and saw the movie on opening night (as I always do with movies of this caliber) and I must say that I WAS NOT let down. I was VERY happy with the movie. I wouldn't dare say it flawless, but it was very, very good. I'm no expert on Spider-man, but I think I know a good amount about the comic. I was surprised that the movie seemed to follow the comic's story very closely. There were a few things that I KNOW were changed, but otherwise, it was pretty much the same story as the comic. ...And if I didn't mention it, that is a good thing. I thought the story was great! I must admit that when I heard that Tobey Maquire was going to play Peter Parker/Spider-man, I was quite sceptical. I just had to hope that he could pull it off. In the end, I was VERY pleased with his performance. He played the perfect Peter Parker and really worked out to get the physical look of Spider-man. So, I have to give a "thumbs up" to Tobey, he pulled it off and did a great job. As for the rest of the cast, I thought they were pretty good as well. Willem Dafoe did a good job with Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin, but I didn't really have any doubt that he could pull it off. Kirsten Dunst was definitely a great addition to the film. She did an EXCELLENT job as Mary Jane, and definitely looked the part. I give her a "thumbs up" too. The rest of the cast were pretty much unknown to me, but I'll give them good props too. As for the director, Sam Raimi, I have to say that I was also a bit sceptical of him taking on this project. Don't get me wrong, I loved his other work, (Army Of Darkness, The Gift, For Love Of The Game, Darkman, etc), but I was still unsure if he could pull it off. Well, in my opinion, he did it, Sam did a fantastic job and I gotta give him props too. Oh, and I also loved that Sam threw in a cameo for his buddy Bruce Campbell (also knows as Ash from the "Evil Dead" Series). If you didn't catch him in the film, he was the ring announcer near the beginning of the film. The only complaint I have about the movie was SOME of the special effects. Sometimes they just looked incredible, but other times they looked VERY cartoon-ish. But, I definitely wouldn't let something like that influence my overall liking of the film. All in all, I thought the film was great, and well worth the wait and the money I spent for the ticket. I think I may just have to go see this one in the theater again before it's gone. This movie is pretty much for everyone, I can definitely see kids liking it and grown-ups can appreciate it too. There wasn't anything in the movie that was overly kiddy. Anyhow, I hope you like the movie as much as I did, and thanks for reading. -Chris
10.0~The wait is over! Browns930 Sign in Permalink This movie is well worth the long wait. It is true to the story of the beloved comics. The movie fully captures the characters. The effects made the web swinging look real. The battle scenes were well choreographed. Besides all this, the plot is present, unlike in many special effect films. This movie had it all Action, Romance, Comedy, and Drama. If I were you, I would go out and see it. Although it took like 3 years, the wait is over. I could go into more detail, but it would spoil the surprise. Enjoy!
5.0~Too disappointed ! yachtsman Sign in Permalink Maybe I've expected a lot from it, it turned out to be too disappointed for me ! I'm not saying that the movie is not good. However, it certainly is NOT as good as others say (think). I personally think that this movie is the worst among all the "super heroes" movies !
10.0~One of the best comic book adaptations Rautus Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is one of the popular comic book heroes and the film portraits it perfectly. Directed by Sam Raimi who did Evil Dead and Darkman Spider-Man has some good acting and FX. The Green Goblin's suit was high tech looking from the animated series. The plot followed the comic's storyline and is very close at times, Spider-Man's beginning was like that of the comic. Sam Raimi really did a good job on the film. The FX was good with the several CGI scenes that captured the web slinging nicely. The acting was good from everyone, Tobe had sensitive and heroic quality. If you're a fan of the comic of superhero type films then check Spider-Man out. I also recommend: Spawn, X-Men, Daredevil and The Punisher (Both versions)
9.0~Great film ryanb-38348 Sign in Permalink This film is amazing full of action and great moments best spiderman film as the first one i ever watched.Definately a must watch film.
2.0~It wasn't even about batman??? bpfreek7 Sign in Permalink Okay...I went to watch this movie expecting a good batman movie...but no. Spiderman took the spotlight. So I decided to watch this movie. As I watched it I noticed something. It sucks more then Pam Anderson. If you read the comics you would know that spiderman doesn't have the webs shooting out of his skin. Peter parker got bitten by the spider and had every power but that. So he built a machine that shot webs. So other than this movie being accurate it has a few issues. Mainly that it is a lot of talking and not enough action. When I open a movie expecting batman and get spiderman, I at least expect some action. Instead the only real fight was the end with the Green goblin. Even that was boring. you would expect a great ending fight but instead you get half bored to death hoping for the fight to finally end. I finished my night unsatisfied and a little dead on the inside a 2 out of 10 is an acceptable rate for this movie.
10.0~All I can say is, hell yeah! snakeman64 Sign in Permalink I had the opportunity to see Spider-Man in an advanced screening. All i could say after the movie ended was, hell yeah! I am a film student at the University of Oklahoma, and you can ask my friends of how picky and critical I am of the films I watch. Needless to say, it takes a lot to impress me. Well, my hat goes off to Sam Raimi on this one. I am a big fan of the Evil Dead series and of the Spider-Man comics, so I had a feeling I was in for an awesome ride. Indeed I was. I've heard many people complaining about the CGI in this film, but I'd like to see them come up with a better way of doing it. I mean, I usually am critical of the use of CGI being a film student, but then again I was thinking that to recreate the agility and superhuman skills of Spider-Man, you almost have to. Also, (the CGI)was done very well and very stylish. Many other aspects made this a great flick. Danny Elfman's (Batman, Edward Scissorhands) score was nothing short of fantastic, and the casting was high caliber all the way around. Tobey Maguire was perfect as the nerdy high-school student/turned superhero, Kirsten Dunst was great as the extremely sultry yet almost innocent Mary Jane, and Willem Dafoe's portrayal of the psychotic super-villain the Green Goblin was almost so believable it was scary. This is one of the most stylisticly done superhero movies done since Burton's Batman. Give it a look, you won't be disappointed. Trust me.
10.0~Spider man is the best damn kick ass super hero! el_comecolloyo Sign in Permalink Great movie, Raimi did a great job. But there are some things i dont like. 1. The goblin costume and actor: there are lot better actors for that character he have face de un mammon. 2. The costume: expecting i was for the classic goblin, but the but una mierda of mask and costume. I'm wondering how Peter Parker made his costume though it was awesome. Well, the movie was great and the Visuals are great. Raimi did good.
8.0~Whoa! dimturiel Sign in Permalink This film left me dumbstruck, and afterwards I just kept visualizing myself leaping over the theater seats and swinging over some balcony barriers. No, I did not want to become a monkey, but watching a live-action Spider-Man on-screen coaxed me into suspending disbelief for a short while; if you'd told me immediately after I saw it that you'd seen someone swinging across the skyline, I'd have believed you in a second. I wanted to be the wall-crawling superhero, but I also wanted to be Mary Jane as well! Tobey Maguire portrays the average guy who's suddenly blessed with extraordinary capabilities, and he shows how Peter Parker grows into the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man New York comes to love. Even though I initially thought that he wasn't fit for the role, he proved me wrong. Go see this movie.
8.0~Some Parts Don't Hold Up Today But Still A Good Introduction to Spider-Man FilmFreak94 Sign in Permalink Geeky science-wiz and High School student, Peter Parker, was bitten by a radioactive spider while on a field trip and developed spider like powers which allows him to climb up walls, shoot a web and swing on it and super strength. At first he uses these powers for his own gain but when his Uncle Ben is murdered in cold blood by a thief Peter decides to use his powers for the benefit of New York City. As his Uncle Ben said, "With great power comes great responsibility." While this is going on, Norman Osborn the head of OsCorp has taken a super serum and has gained super strength and a twisted alter ego. He dons a glider and body armor to become The Green Goblin and begins terrorizing the city. He has made it his personal goal to get Spider-Man to join him on his personal crusade against order. Spider-Man has to balance being fresh out of High School, his relationships with his friends and Aunt, and stop Goblin from hurting innocent people. The plot is what you'd come to expect for an origin story but some parts of the film when looked at today are considerably dated. Most of the CGI while impressive for its time looks very fake when compared to the effects we're used to today. Even back then they looked a tad off. For instance scenes where the Goblin is flying on his glider or when Spider- Man is climbing a wall or jumping off something are pretty obviously CGI. It doesn't take you out of the feel for the movie per se but it looks a little jarring. What might take you out of the moment is some of the dialog. Comics in their day had some pretty corny dialog but recently movies have been averting the corny dialog. And even though this movie was one of the first superhero films to revive the genre some of the dialog feels very forced. The scenes with Peter and Mary Jane (his love interest) are sometimes good but other times they feel awkward and that's probably what they're going for since Peter is supposed to be awkward but when he's Spider-Man it still feels a bit awkward. The Goblin's dialog is like it was taken out of the Adam West Batman TV Show. That isn't terrible in fact it's actually really enjoyable but if we're trying to take him seriously as a threat his dialog has to have a little more threatening tone to it. But the film still holds up on the emotional side of Spider-Man. The scene where Uncle Ben is killed is still sad and the relationship Peter has with his friends and Aunt May are performed very well. It's just the dialog that makes it feel a little forced. And the fight scenes are still engaging and filled with energy. The cast pull their characters off as if they were made for the parts. Tobey Maquire does a good balancing act as Spidey and Peter Parker keeping Spidey's sarcastic sense of humor and Peter's nerdy behavior. Kirsten Dunst plays a decent Mary Jane, James Franco pulls Harry Osborn's relationship with his father very realistically, and Willem Dafoe is in my opinion the best actor they could've picked for Goblin and Norman. The one that stands out as the best though is J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jamerson. There is no doubt about it he is the perfect Jamerson. His quick humor and motor mouth fit the character to a t, and I can't think of anything bad to say about his performance. So while the film has a lot of flaws it's still a fun movie to watch. It's a nice introduction to Spider-Man if you've never heard of the character(surprisingly enough) and a good film on its own. I give Spider-Man a 7.5 leaning to an 8.
9.0~Spiderman Review stacie_nicole2001 Sign in Permalink There is no doubt Spiderman is an excellent movie. I would highly recommend this film to movie goers as this incredible yet lifelike action film is paced by the plot and the characters to keep the interest of the audience. This movie takes the comic book genre to the next level. The directors reinvented the comics into an epic journey by enhancing the already brilliant characters and making them more realistic similar to the movies X-Men and The Hulk. What captivated my attention the most is the unbelievable fantastic special effects. The theme is a super hero who fights crime in New York City and stops criminals making the world a better place. The plot of the movie is about a high school student name Peter (Tobey Maguire) who is transformed into an ultra-superhero after he is bitten by a spider that has been genetically altered in a lab. Once Peter transforms into Spiderman he discovers that all of his senses are enhanced such as the ability to hear and see better, climb buildings with his spider hands and swing from building to building using his web as a brace. Spiderman starts to develop feelings for a fellow classmate named Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and she falls for Spiderman. Peter takes a liking to becoming a super hero and fighting off criminals, Spiderman becomes famous and all along no one knows who the real Spiderman is. Then comes the Green Goblin/Norman (Harry Osborn), Norman is the father of a close friend of Peters who develops an alter ego from testing a dangerous chemical on himself. The Green Goblin makes it a mission to destroy Spiderman and uses Mary Jane in the process by kidnapping her and putting her in a harmful situation in an attempt to attract Spiderman. In the end Spiderman defeats the Green Goblin and the movie ends with a cliff hanger because Green Goblin/Normans son Harry (James Franco) vales to destroy Spiderman for what he has done to his father. The angles of the film are very important to captivating the audience and relating to the theme as a major part of the film is Spiderman gliding in the air making the angles and lighting tie into the importance of making Spiderman's action shots appear realistic and lifelike. This is important to the theme because Spiderman is a Superhero that stops criminals and makes the world a better place.
7.0~ups and downs showa48 Sign in Permalink As I see it, Spiderman has some good parts to it, but unfortunately one large drawback (some spoilers) The good parts: 1. The viewers follow Spiderman right from the (nerdy) beginning, where he starts out being the "wimpy and weird" kid in the class, and indeed in the entire high school. We see the blue-collar neighborhood where he grew up as well. This is all done very believable, and especially the uncle and aunt of Spiderman/Peter Parker are portrayed very heart-warmingly and realistically. 2. Comical/self-irony reliefs: Spiderman is portrayed as far less self-righteous and self-inflated than, for example, Batman. Especially the "wrestling scene", where Peter, having discovered his super abilities, wants to raise money by fighting "Bone Saw" for three minutes. ..And some other scenes/aspects of the movie.. The Bad Part: The Green Goblin. This must be one of the worst things I have ever seen, when it comes to "bad guys". After Norman/Green Goblin killed the board of the company, who fired him, he essentially seems to have no other motivation in his life as a super-baddie than bothering and bugging Spiderman. It is believable that he has some kind of subconscious grudge against Spiderman, but that his entire existence hinges on either "turning over to the dark side" or, alternatively, destroying Spiderman is not entirely believable or fulfilling. This is simply too little for a full-length feature!!
7.0~Caught in its web of entertainment. Tresix Sign in Permalink Fans of Spider-Man had been waiting for the webslinger to hit the big screen since 1985 when Cannon Films (the people responsible for MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE and SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE) had the movie rights tot he character. Then it looked as if 21ST Century Films (who gave us that truly awful adaptation of CAPTAIN AMERICA (1990) would make the movie. Now, after all of the legal battles have been settled, SPIDER-MAN has finally hit the movies. I'll confess, I'm more of a DC Comics fan, Batman in particular. But, hey, any film based off of a comic book superhero can only be a good thing, right? And SPIDER-MAN IS a good thing. Even the most casual comic fan will know the story: young Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is an orphaned high school student who is pushed around by practically everyone. For years, he has had a crush on Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), the girl next door. One day, on a school field trip, Parker is bitten by a genetically-altered (as opposed to radiation like in the comics) spider. As a result, he begins to go through some SERIOUS changes: His eyesight is improved where he no longer needs glasses, his physique is now buffed beyond belief, he has phenomenal strength and agility and can stick to walls and ceilings. But there is the most important change: he now can shoot webs from his wrists (unlike the mechanical webshooters from the comics). I suppose they had to make the webbing come from his arms as opposed to where a spider's web REALLY comes from (let's just say it's why you see spiders hanging upside down when they dangle from the thread), it would be too embarrassing otherwise. At first, Parker tries to use his powers to become a pro wrestler (he squares off against none other than Randy "Macho Man" Savage), until those fateful events: A robbery that Parker could have stopped. The escaped crook pulls a carjacking, of whom the victim happens to be his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), who had earlier tried to tell Peter "With great power also comes great responsibility". When Peter realizes that the man who killed his uncle is the same one he could have stopped earlier, that is when he decides to become a superhero. Sam Raimi directs with an understated flair that isn't quite as over-the-top as his style on the EVIL DEAD movies, but you will still have a good time. The villainy of SPIDER-MAN is provided by businessman Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) who, after experimenting with equipment that was supposed to go to the military, goes insane and ends up becoming the Green Goblin. Dafoe's laugh rivals that of Jack Nicholson's Joker in BATMAN. In fact, there are some scenes here that will remind you of Tim Burton's 1989 blockbuster (The parade with balloons, the hero and villain fighting over the heroine in a dilapidated, abandoned building in darkness) as well as the 1978 SUPERMAN (Parker running down the street, ripping open his shirt to reveal his costume underneath), especially in the scenes set at the Daily Bugle, the newspaper run by the ever-cranky J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) that will recall Perry White and the Daily Planet in the earlier movie. Also on hand are Sam Raimi regulars Bruce Campbell (as the wrestling ring announcer) and his younger brother Tim (as one of Jameson's assistants). Needless to say, the movie ends with the possibility of a sequel, which probably would have materialized even if the movie didn't become the hit that everyone is predicting that it will be. After all, with the probable exceptions of Batman and the Flash, Spider-Man has the most interesting and recognizable rogue's gallery of any superhero. From the multi-armed Doctor Octopus, the ever-shifting Sandman or Spider-Man's evil doppleganger Venom (and his "offspring" Carnage), there are no ending to sequel tales. Of which I, like millions other, am looking forward to.
4.0~Its OK but just too over-hyped... mckillotd Sign in Permalink OK, first things first, this is not a bad film. It may actually have been quite good, but I seen it on the back of all this hype proclaiming it as the greatest comic book film ever made and a fantastic spectacle of special effects and this let it down badly. The effects are amateurish compared to other good CGI films and not a patch on the likes of Lord of the Rings, with the scenes of Spiderman swinging through L.A. looking more like a computer game than real life. I don't understand how it got Oscar nominations as surely the point of CGI is that you don't even notice it isn't real and this clearly looks computer drawn. The plot was OK and quite true to the comics but it just didn't grab my attention quick enough. I also found Kirsten Dunst a highly unconvincing Mary Jane. Toby Maguire is nerdy enough to play Peter Parker well and does a good job as the transformed Spiderman and Willem Defoe overacts superbly as Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin, but overall the acting left me feeling distinctly underwhelmed. Like I said, it may have been the timing and the very high expectations I had but I left the cinema feeling very disappointed, and as I was a fan of the comics and even the TV series in my much younger days and this just failed to fill the void of expectation. Worth watching on TV, but I wouldn't pay to see it....
10.0~This could be the start of a great line of summer movies for 2002 c_p_c Sign in Permalink This movie has everything going for it, a great and loved hero, an all star cast (any movie with Kirsten Dunst can't be all that bad, awesome visual effects, and a great appeal. Everything in this movie seemed so real, and I don't mean Toby Maguire climbing up walls, I mean the action and the fight scenes were incredible. The visual effects in this movie will send you for a major ride. I think this movie could be a great start to a summer of good releases. The acting is good, the characters are believable, they make spider-man look really cool, and after seeing it you will want to swing through the buildings in your city. However, there is one thing in the end that bothered many people. I won't say what it is for the sake of not giving anything away, but if they changed it the movie would be perfect. Because the entire 2 hours before the ending were absolutely awesome I give Spider-man a 7/10.
10.0~Could it have been better than this? Rev Tim Benjamin Sign in Permalink No way. This was one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. I have seen it in the theater three times and I have plans to see it again today. The acting was great. The special effects were great. The story was great. And to top it all off, Spiderman was in it. Movies don't get any better than this.
10.0~An Entertaining, Superb and Well Executed Superhero Movie Aly200 Sign in Permalink Bryan Singer's "X-Men" have started getting audiences excited for the modern superhero movies, but when Sam Raimi released his first "Spider Man" outing the expectations bar immediately shot to the stratosphere. Raimi delivered on his promise of an exciting and action-packed film about Marvel Comic's famous web-slinging superhero. We are given the basic origin story of how teenage Peter Parker gains his famous powers after a radioactive spider bites him, but we are treated to an engaging narrative as the newly minted hero must contend with his most deadly adversary in the wicked Green Goblin while also contending with normal teenage drama such as an at-times contentious friendship as well as harboring feelings for his pretty neighbor. Stepping into the web-slinger's famous costume is the well cast Tobey Maguire who deftly manages to play both the nerdy Peter Parker and courageous Spider Man with equal flair. Despite being nearly thirty years old at the time of filming, Maguire's youthful appearance convinces the audience that he resembles a teenager and not a mature young man. Even when inhabiting Spidey's famous suit, Maguire displays a youthful machismo mixed with some naivety as Peter is still coming into his element as a superhero but proves himself as fearless when confronted by his emerald-clad nemesis, the Green Goblin. While other more seasoned young actors were considered, the gamble to go with Maguire paid handsomely as he carries the weight of both average New York teen and crime-fighting legend in harmonious tandem. On the opposite side of the board playing the villainous Green Goblin and his unstable alter ego, Norman Osbourne, is the wickedly delightful Willem Dafoe in one of his most insane roles. When the film starts and Norman is running his successful company, Dafoe portrays a fatherly wisdom for young actors Tobey Maguire as Peter and James Franco who plays Norman's son, Harry, but also shows early signs of the soon-to-be shattered psyche that will doom Norman to the corruptible power of the Goblin persona (the result of a lab accident where Norman tests a power-enhancing drug on himself and kills a fellow scientist in his mania). Once the transformation into an unstable madman begins to take effect, Dafoe fully embraces the insanity and goes as over the top as possible, utilizing his vocal talents by using a lighter vocal tone for the tormented Norman while using his trademark gravelly sounding voice and a cackling demented laugh for the wicked Goblin, without becoming a cartoonish impression of the famous super-villain but as a calculating and dangerous adversary who strikes fear into everyone around New York. Added to the excitement of watching the actor in action is that instead of having a stuntman do the brunt work of maneuvering the Goblin's glider and engaging in fisticuffs with Spider Man is that Willem Dafoe performs his own stunts (the actor himself stated the fact in numerous interviews and the filmmakers backed Dafoe's statements). A talented supporting cast rounds out the compelling characters with Kirsten Dunst as Peter Parker's longtime neighbor and love interest, Mary Jane Watson, James Franco as Peter's best friend< Harry Osbourne who happens to be the son of his mortal enemy, Rosemary Harris as Peter's beloved Aunt May and cliff Robertson in the role of Uncle Ben (who sadly doesn't make it to the halfway mark of the film as comic book fans know well) and in a scene- stealing role as hot-headed and grouchy boss of the Daily Bugle, J. Jonah Jameson, is J.K. Simmons in what is one of the character actor's most iconic roles. The film's action sequences are well choreographed and executed from Peter Parker's first attempts to use his enhanced spider-like abilities to the infamous introduction of the Green Goblin at an Oscorp party to the dynamic final confrontation between Spidey and his emerald nemesis where the fists fly and ass-kicking just draws the attention in and doesn't relent till a victor is declared. The filmmakers use as little CGI as possible except for Spider Man's web-slinging across the city since director Sam Raimi is known for using practical effects in his films. The narrative of the film as mentioned before sets up the main action with the origin of Spider Man when Peter is bitten by the radioactive spider on a field trip with his class and we are given Green Goblin's origin as well with Norman Osbourne's ill-advised test of his company's drug on himself that causes him to become the demented villain we love to hate. The story then shifts into the main plot of how Spider Man comes to learn what he must do as a hero to protect his beloved city and loved ones. A truly masterful superhero film that really ushered in the modern superhero craze.
9.0~Great comic book adventure. kirk-246 Sign in Permalink 'Spider-Man' is a great example of a comic book based movie.It has plenty of style,action,heart and has a great message that everyone can swing to: With great power comes great responsibility.For example,if you wake up one day and you find out that you have superhuman strength,use it for the good of mankind.Don't use it for evil.When something great lands in your laps,use it wisely.Don't take advantage of it.That's why Spider-Man is such a great superhero.Well,many superheros use their powers for good,but Spider-Man is still great.So everybody should sit down and enjoy this wonderful superhero movie that's a feast for the eyes and imagination.But don't just watch this movie.Watch the sequels.They're even better.
8.0~Very entertaining jonmmartinez Sign in Permalink A great story and 'matrix'-like effects make this movie very entertaining. Some of the effects look a little unrealistic, but its a movie and I can't see how it could be made without CGI. Can't wait for Spiderman 2.
6.0~Entertaining, but cartoony and shallow charchuk Sign in Permalink While spectacular when first seen, this movie does not age well at all. Even now, only four years after its opening, the special effects look dated and cartoony, and the story seems shallow and underdeveloped. It could be because of the release of much superior comic book films in that time span, or simply because the film dazzles at first and then begins to fade. Still, this is a very entertaining movie, albeit a bit cheezy and campy, which works at times, but not for the whole movie. Though the origin story is done very well - one of the best of its kind - the main plot of the movie is weak and pales in comparison. Part of this is the poorly done villain - not nearly developed enough, with a horrible costume to boot. Had the Jekyll-and-Hyde aspect been done better, the Goblin would have been much scarier, but now it just seems laughable. Speaking of laughable, the romance in this film is terrible - some of the lines are cringe-worthy, and it doesn't help that the actors are mostly wooden. Maguire is decent, but better and more believable as the nerdy Peter Parker than the amazing Spider-Man. Dunst is terrible, and unfortunately began the tradition of younger female leads in superhero movies. Dafoe is way over-the-top, but still enjoyable, and Franco is moody and unremarkable. Only J.K Simmons as the newspaper boss Jameson stands out, as he is both funny and true to his character. That's not to say this is a terrible movie. As mentioned previously, the origin story is very strong, from the original spider bite all the way until his superhero status. Though some of the drama is poorly developed, the comedic aspect of it is perfect, and suits the story perfectly. The action scenes are spectacular, and the poor CGI is only really noticeable during the close-ups. And the film is never boring, and tells its (somewhat weak) story well. So, overall, an entertaining superhero flick, but nowhere near the best comic book flick ever.
3.0~This is the story of Peter Parker and MaryJane Watson... kby Sign in Permalink I have two words for this movie.... teen flick. Regardless of whether I'm speaking as a fan or as a movie-goer, these two words sum up exactly what this movie is. The impression I got from the movie was this...it's a teenage love story between a geek and a slut, oh...and by the way, the geek has super powers...the end. I think they should've saved us all a lot of money and a lot of grief by calling the movie what it is... "The Life of Peter Parker" because Spiderman actually appeared in less than 20% of the movie. The Spiderman component was so small; it was almost like an after thought that the producers squeezed in later. This movie seems to have started as an old fashion kiddies love story, but since that idea doesn't sell tickets anymore, someone decides to throw in the Spiderman bit. The title is really misleading because I truly felt we're looking at this backwards. The truth is, it's a teenybopper story that used the superpower idea as an excuse to show off their fancy computer work. This movie did not deliver as a Spiderman Movie; in fact, it didn't even deliver as a movie. The plotline was childishly simple and unbelievably inconsistent; action sequence was nothing but bad knock-offs of expensive camera tricks seen in "The Matrix", "X-Men", "Swordfish", etc. The entire movie looked like it was shot in Queens, NY and the rest was mediocre 3D rendered environments where we see a computer-generated Spiderman swinging from building to building. I'm going to guess that that's where all the money went, because it sure didn't go to the casting of good actors. Tobey Maguire was a perfect Peter Parker, but a horrible Spiderman. The only real actor that made up for this colossal casting mistake was the performance by William Dafoe as the Green Goblin. He seems to be the only one who actually knew what he was doing, and was performing "in character". Everyone else was merely regurgitating long run-on sentences in corny scenes that were completely irrelevant to the overall plot. This 2002 version was no better than the 1970's mini movies and the cartoon show. It still looks like some guy wearing a Halloween costume running around the city of Queens. You never wondered why Batman didn't look silly popping out gadgets from the rooftops of Gotham City, or how a group of mutants in tight black costumes wouldn't look odd running through New York. Why? In both "Batman" and "X-Men", the scenery, location, props, characters and dialogue were all created around the superhero, not vice versa. Anyone can just shoot a movie about a guy in a skin-tight outfit who catches poorly themed villains, but not everyone can do it so it doesn't look like one big costume party in your backyard. Once again, this movie is reminiscent of last year's "Tomb Raider", a movie composed of mainly photographic images of Angelina Jolie in her cool poses and badly choreographed fighting sequence, but no substance. So, if you haven't seen this movie. I suggest you save yourself some money, and just watch the trailers, which, like all movie trailers have spoiled it by showing you all the best parts of the movie. Then basically, leaving you high and dry and unsatisfied with your jumbo popcorn on your lap. I can honestly tell you, it's not going to get any better than what you see in those trailers. Other than this 30-second clip of high tech computer generated images, everything else are fillers.
7.0~A fun film, but could've been better freaky_dave Sign in Permalink Spiderman was a fun movie. It had some good action scenes, and good performances by both Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire, but I think it could've been better for a couple reasons. One reason is the special effects. I mean Spiderman looks like a bouncing ball as he jumps around and soars through the sky on his web. It just looked corny to me, and you could tell it was all CGI, except for one scene at night where he protects Mary Jane. The other part was the Green Goblin character. William Dafoe is a good actor, and he has a couple scenes here that were all right, but there were also some scenes where he appeared just as corny as the special effects. Also what about Aunt May and J Jonah Jameson. They appeared in the movie but had very little to do. That of course was improved in the second film, which is much better than this one. I'm not trashing the movie. I liked it enough to give it a 7 out of 10, but so much more could've been done to make it better. With the second one it was.
10.0~Excelent Movie with great adaptability for the Big Screen jim-582 Sign in Permalink Th movie, all in all, was an excelent example of another Super-hero flick from Marvel. To Stan Lee: Good on ya mate. I only have a problem with 2 parts of the movie. 1. In the beginning part, when our newly created super hero, peter parker discovers that he has these wonderful new ablilities, he goes running along the roof-tops. Great, excelent, wonderful. The problem I have with that is that he looks like Jar-Jar-Binks running along the roof - TOO MUCH FLUIDITY - (straight out of 3d Studio Max). The other problem I have with the movie is that it broke away from the original story-line in that his body produces the web, whereas the original, he develops the web fluid himself and has canisters of the stuff stored all over the city. But the rest of the movie more than makes up for these little problems, and all in all i give this wonderful piece of work 98%.
9.0~A new and exciting era for spider-man! jamiemarks-1 Sign in Permalink A friend once said to me that characters from a book, comic or computer game cannot be made into a successful film. Based on the evidence of this film he is wrong. Spiderman has been faithfully adapted from the old worn down but classic comic books of the fifties and onto the big screen. And it is fantastic. Sam Raimi a director before this who I was not familiar with had made this a winner. The concept of the character and the surrounding story is spot on. Toby Maguire plays Peter Parker/Spiderman with real understanding. He conveys the right tone a being smart but awkward around the love of his life Mary Jane Watson but and has the wit and the looks to show heart. Support from James Franco and Kirsten Dunst as Harry and Mary Jane keeps the central storyline strong. Who ultimately steals the show is Willem Dafoe who plays the villain. The Green Goblin. He dominates the screen with his menacing fashion and a hilariously cackling laughter making the Goblin a fearsome adversary. And the whole thing is done with splat stick humour on the side, which helps the characters develop. The special effects such as the Spidey's suit and the Green Goblin is excellent against the backdrop of set. A couple of minor criticisms about the film, which stopped me giving it a ten was that some of the special effects were a bit cliché in places noticeably when Spiderman is flying and character development like with JK Simmons could have gone further. But pushing that aside. This is a highly entertaining superhero blockbuster that captures the tone and essence of the comics and what promises to be a new and exciting era for Spiderman!
10.0~Bloody Awesome...Can't wait for the sequel nishan69-1 Sign in Permalink Spiderman is fantastic. I could definitely watch it again n again. For all spiderman comic book fans like myself it's a dream come true. And with GORGEOUS Kirsten Dunst in it..well..what more could you ask for. The storyline is brilliant, so is the directing....i am so excited with this that i can't wait for the sequel.
10.0~because I love the spiderman story jachen01 Sign in Permalink If you like the Spiderman story, you'll like the movie. I personally loved it. It's so twisted, it's just great. A lot of people didn't understand the ending, which is why they didn't like the movie. They don't know that the reason he acted that way at the end was to protect the people that he loves. Willem Dafoe and Tobey Maguire were the perfect actors for the roles. Willem Dafoe has always been a great actor, and so has Tobey. Kirsten Dunst was good for the part, even though she wouldn't have been my first pick. She and Tobey had good chemistry together.
7.0~Spider-Man the movie? Average. FlRELlGHT Sign in Permalink This is not the best comic book movie ever. That honor still belongs to the first Superman. I enjoyed the Peter Parker scenes, but felt let down by the action, and Danny Elfman's terrible score. I didn't hate the film, there were moments that were quite good. Like when Peter is first discovering his Spidey abilities. But it didn't have that same mythic quality that the first Superman had. The actors did there best with the script. J.J Jameson was real good, but the story felt pedestrian. The rivalry between the Goblin and Spider-Man wasn't developed enough. I give the film a 7 because it was better than most of the summer blockbusters last year. (Planet of the Apes anyone?) But it was missing certain qualities that would have elevated it to classic status. Go see it and decide for yourself though.
7.0~Fine Movie... Couldn't be great... noxhitman Sign in Permalink This movie is o.k. I recommend it to anyone who wants to spend some with a movie that finishes happy and wants get out smiling. Sometimes we all get tired of the same old sh*t, but this one does good and times in times you will have yourself inside the movie, that means this movie is really entertaining. The effects were a bit of a let down, if you pay attention you will see that sometimes he "throws" his web in the air ( I really don't know how can that glue in the air :p), although it has some flaws there is never a HUGE mistake. Go to see this one with an open mind and try not to pay attention to the effects, it is not good to see flaws in a movie, it spoils everything. All in all good movie. My Rating 7/10 ( by the way the USA flag in the end of the movie sucked )
7.0~A glorious New York! fabio-46 Sign in Permalink This movie is pretty good and shows up the best New York. In some frame it is possible to see the Twin Towers! Where else Spiderman could fly if not among the high building of Manhattan? The story is good, the special FX well realized. If you want to spend a couple of hours having fun and good time you'd better view this movie.
10.0~The hype is true! Warrior728 Sign in Permalink My second favorite comic book movie of all time. Nothing can top Superman to me, but this came just as close as any movie can. Spidey finally gets his place on the big screen, and it couldn't have been done any better. All I can say is, go see it. Looks like this could be the start of great things with Marvel inspired films hitting the big screen. As someone who has longed for the day when comic book movies would rule the box office, I couldn't be any happier.
5.0~Decent, but could have been better azjazz Sign in Permalink While this was an enjoyable film, it didn't quite meet up to my expectations (which were pretty high - the trailers for the movie were excellent!) I had three main complaints: (1) The movie would have benefited by adding an additional 15-25 minutes of final footage and a little more time on the editing floor. I felt that the director/Marvel tried to fit way too much plot & character development into a 2 hour film. The end result was a congested film that didn't flow smoothly. There were also odd plot "jumps" that could have been eliminated. (2) The love scenes could have been more polished and had less "comic book" script lines. It was clear that the actors struggled with many of the love scene lines. (3) Marvel/Sony should have spent a little more on the Green Goblin / Spider-man special effects. A lot of the action scenes looked obviously computer-generated. Today's technology could have provided a more realistic result. The claims about how the director "wanted" that look are purely ridiculous and just a cover-up for where they just didn't want to spend the money. (How did his webbing work in the movie? They weren't really clear on that ...) These points aside, I think Marvel/Sony did an great job otherwise. The film was fun to watch, and I really enjoyed seeing one of my favorite comic-book heroes come to life. Toby McGuire did an excellent job as Peter Parker, and many of the other characters were believable as well. The plotline of how he got his powers in the movie had a more realistic ring to it than the comic line of a "radioactive" spider bite. I look forward to a sequel that is better than the first movie... azjazz
5.0~this movie is not very believable yayamafiya-55211 Sign in Permalink This movie is strange or maybe I dont understand american movies. It is about a man or boy or teenage man who, he gets eaten by a spider and it gives him magic. It is weird and interesting and stragne at the same time. He wearing a kind of clothes that look more like something from american halloween and climbing him buildings. like he is a spider. It is interesting, but not like horror movie, which would be better if he is eaten by a spider. Instead, he is like "good guy." I dont really understand this movies, but it is ok. I think movie like this can be really good, if when, he is eaten by spider it making him more scary and turn him into actual spider instead of him wearing halloween pajaams. I like the story but I just don't believe it. Nobody can climb buildings if even you are eaten by spider. Magic spider dont make you climb buildings, but maybe in world like this it is possible. I notice many american movies like this. People put on clothes that are funny, making names about animals, and then they go fighting people. Dont watch this movie if you think it will be horror movie about a man who is like spider. Is more like a movie only kid children will believe. I dont know if this movie make much money, but looks like they spend much money on it, so I think they dont get the money back because it is not movie easy to believe. But if they spend so much money as it seems, I am not sure why they save money on giving him pajaams, and why don't just go ahead make him a spider. It is hard to believe he is spider man even if he can fly in movie, if he is wearing pajams.
10.0~The ride of my life sarahread Sign in Permalink I enjoyed Spider-Man. It is the second best movie I have ever seen (the best being Fight Club). The visual effects were stunning, and Tobey Maguire's performance was excellent. The only drawbacks to the movie were that it was inconsistent with the comic books. All in all, Spider-man was good! If you haven't seen it, you really should.
10.0~an awesome big screen debut for spidey disdressed12 Sign in Permalink this first Spiderman is an awesome movie.it has a great story,a great villain and excellent music.the cgi effects were not quite perfect,especially in scenes where spidey is swinging along or leaping from one building to another.however once you are immersed in the story you quickly forget all that.Tobey Maguire seemed an odd choice to play Spidey at,first,but he quickly grows on you.Kirten Dunst does a decent job as the love interest,Mary Jane Watson.However,it is Willem Dafoe who steals the movie with his portrayal of the Green Goblin.the Goblin is a great first villain for Spidey.i do wish though that the had chosen a better costume for him.i like the fact that they stayed fairly true to the comic,and kept Peter Parker/Spider Man as a(sort of)normal human being with problems in his personal life and at school.he is someone the average joe can relate to rather than some godlike being.summing up,this a great first movie for Spidey's big screen debut. 10/10
10.0~Great classic remake blackmamba99971 Sign in Permalink I was so surprised seeing this film. Sam Raimi did a wonderful job of remaking this classic to the most popular superhero genre today. Toby Mcguire is fantastic as the nerdy book worm who by happenstance gets bitten by a radioactive experimental spider, which results in Peter Parkers (Mcguire) new found powers. His new world changes as he begins his adventures on stopping the bad guys from evil doings in the big city. People either can take him as a good guy, or the bad guy but his results are still the same. His motivation is because of his uncle's death from a coincidental mugger who happens to be let go by parker after a wrestling bout. As he was trying to cash in, the robber passes him and he lets him go, resulting in his uncle's demise. This story is intricate, well thought out, and the graphics are excellent. It is a great story and wonderful thrill ride who still loves to read the grand comics by Stan Lee. And the sequel is just as much the roller coaster ride as this film.
10.0~Wow! Phenryss Sign in Permalink Well, I saw this movie 3 times in the opening week!! Wonderful adaption of the Comic Book Characters. The few updates and minor changes did not effect the on-target direction of the movie. The changes actually made sense in this decade...the original comics were in the scare-era of the 1960's...so some change was needed with the information we have now. Tobey Maguire is AWESOME!! Some people have griped about his deadpan delivery of the narration, but I kinda took that to be just nerdy enough to be believable. Willem Defoe was also wonderful as the Green Goblin...but the costume they gave him STUNK! He is great at playing twisted characters (See Shadow of the Vampire) Kirsten Dunst, I will try to be nice here, was just wrong. MJ is supposed to be a strong character, not a bubbly bimbo. Sorry. The costumes and effects were all right-on. Thanks to Sam Raimi for a wonderful homage to this character.
9.0~Best Marvel thus far fart_fire69 Sign in Permalink Well if you're a marvel comics fan, and you hate how they screw up the plots you hold so dear, then you won't be THAT disappointed in this movie. Unlike X-men and Blade, Marvel actually stuck the the story line and strayed only a little. Sure, Parker's first girl wasn't MJ, but hey... Betty was boring I think. Felica Hardy is hopefully in a sequel. Just 3 things ticked me off, watching the green goblin talk and not have his mouth move (it annoyed me for some reason), Kirsten Dunst just reminds me of a ditsy blonde from Bring It On, not a Red Head like MJ, and the fact that MJ said 'Tiger' like once, maybe twice... which is practically MJ's catch phrase. But those are minor details... still a good movie
10.0~The best Comic Book Film of all time. Nuff said. marc_wrz Sign in Permalink Wow, today I along with millions of others, saw Spider-Man today (opening day) and all I can say is wow. Every good once in awhile, a movie succeeds my expectations. I didn't think Spider-Man would, mine were pretty high, but guess what, I was blown away by the sheer fun of this movie! Is it the thinking man's movie, no, but is it what entertainment is all about? Yep, and that's why I gave this a rating of ten, course I'd really give it a 9.6 (more on that later.) Tobey Maguire must really be a nerd in real life because he captured of the essence of Peter Parker beautifully, and his Spider-Man? He got that in a big way too. His Parker simply shines though, as a very believable hero. William Dafoe, man what a great actor, shame the Oscar's will snub this film, because Dafoe simply scares me with his sheer ability to play an insane man. His reason in becoming the Goblin is very believable and well this villain is evil. Flat-out evil. Innocent lives? The Goblin sure doesn't care. Kirstin Dunst, she looks good, and she acts pretty good, course my only complaint is her scenes while good and give the film depth just kinda drag due to her. She's slow in delivering lines...She's the reason knock this film down to 9.6 The rest of the cast; Aunt May and Uncle Ben were great and especially J. Jonah Jameson, this guy shines throughout the entire film. And of course, Bruce Campbell, wow I love this guy, I also love the fact that he's integral to Spidey's name. You'll understand after watching the film. And finally for the comic fan, can you find all the homages? hehe, there everywhere and they were great. Overall, this film was excellent entertainment and kept me entertained the whole way throughout. Go see it ASAP!
8.0~Fun and smart billcr12 Sign in Permalink I admit expecting a silly, immature waste of time when I started to watch spider man, believing that I would last about ten minutes. Two hours later, as the credits rolled, I must admit that Sam Raimi made a really good and entertaining comic book adventure suited to adults. Toby Maguire is just right as Peter Parker, with the aw shucks, humble kid next store demeanor for the part. He is smooth and likable and Raimi made the right choice. Dr. Norman Osborn is the central villain and Willem Defoe is a villain from hell who is the right actor for the part. The weak link is Kirsten Dunst who is whiny, clingy and downright annoying. The strengths heavily outweigh the weaknesses so just sit back and enjoy the ride.
10.0~Pleasant surprise duraflex Sign in Permalink Although I grew up reading and watching Superman, Superboy and Batman, I ignored the SpiderMan comics entirely. On a whim, I rented the DVD and found it very entertaining - although I would have been a little lost without using the optional pop-up info windows. Tobey McGuire is perfectly cast as Peter Parker/SpiderMan. He brings a believability to the character and shows warmth and sensitivity as well as great strength and intelligence. The "flying spider" effects are phenomenally well-done.
8.0~Pretty faithful to the original comic book for a Hollywood production smberens Sign in Permalink Almost everyone applauded the film in the theater when it concluded. I haven't been to a film in years where the audience did that! If this film doesn't do well at the box office, I will be surprised. Bring on Doc Oc in Spidey 2!!!!!
7.0~The weakest of the films. Sirus_the_Virus Sign in Permalink The first Spider-man is probably my least favorite. I don't like it as much because it's kind of boring, and the film mostly focuses on Spider-man. In most comic book films, I want to see more of the villains. We do see plenty of the villain, the Green Goblin, but more of Spider-man. With Spider-man 2, we get both. I liked that. The plot: This film shows how Peter Parker was bitten by a radioactive spider and turned into Spider-man. His best friend's father turns into The Green Goblin, who is living a double life. Peter is in love with a crush of his named Mary Jane, but his best friend is dating her. The first Spider-man film is entertaining. The last ten minutes where Spider-man is getting beaten by the Green Goblin is cool. It sounds wrong I know. To think this is from Director Sam Rami, who did the Evil Dead Trilogy. Occasionally in the Spider-man films, Rami tries to make us jump. Because it's Sam Rami. All of the Spider-man films made me jump, I hate to say it. The first Spider-man film is entertaining, but not the best of the trilogy. I can't wait until Spider-man 4 in 2011. Spider-man is a fun thrill ride that will spin your head around.
8.0~One of the new century FX movies mynameoleg Sign in Permalink Ten years ago it was impossible to make movie like that. Watch for Batman 1 and 2 and feel the difference. XXI century bring us the new movie breed. And i'm happy that fathers of this breed are greatly talented directors - such as Peter Jackson, George Lucas and... of course Sam Raimi. Not only computers made the great job, that we beholds at Spiderman. For example, Chris Columbus never achieves this high new-century-entertainment level in disastrously boring "Harry Potter"... however he used the same computers. Raimi exposed all the depth and width of his frenetic creativity. And now we got the second great comics movie since Tim Burton's Batmans. Thank you, Sam.
10.0~Near-Perfect hockeyguy9 Sign in Permalink This is a near-perfect film, in that it not only provides the origin of Spider-Man, balancing the comic origin with film-friendly changes, but it also immediately introduces the Green Goblin as well as other great characters. I don't know that I've seen many films that could introduce so many characters in 2 hours, and give them some kind of depth and backstory. The first 45 minutes or so of this movie are tremendous. We meet Mary Jane and get to see the whole story of Peter becoming Spider-Man, testing out his powers (some of the best parts of the movie!) and learning that he needs to use his new abilities wisely. Then we are thrust full-speed into Spider-Man's conflict with the Green Goblin (played very well by Willem Dafoe), which does not disappoint as well. I was nervous at first about Tobey Maguire being Peter Parker/Spider-Man, but within the first 10 minutes he proves himself to be ideal for the part. I now could not see anyone else playing Spidey. He nails not only the nerdy pre-superpowers Peter Parker, but also the confident and determined post-superpowers Parker/Spider-Man. He handles the dualities of the character very well...shy but confident, clumsy yet intelligent, meek early on and brave as the story progresses. Meanwhile, Sam Raimi's direction is excellent. The CGI'ed scenes are wonderful and the fight scenes not only are exciting but tell the story well. These are what I think are the three keys to this movie's success. The feel of the movie is perfect. It's not dark like Batman was, but we understand from the get-go that Peter understands that his newfound powers bring great responsibility. Raimi did an excellent job of making this movie feel like what a Spider-Man movie should. He also does the tough job of helping us understand Spidey's powers. Particularly the Spider-Sense. In the comics, we see squiggly lines above Spidey's head to show us he knows something will happen. In the movie, Raimi SHOWS us how Peter can sense things before they happen. Expertly done. The direction is just excellent. The acting is between adequate and excellent all around. Even the small roles, such as J.K. Simmons as J.Jonah Jameson, are honest to the comic book characters and done very well without detracting from the realism of the story. After all, comic characters can get away with things film characters can't. The pacing of the story is perfect. I never felt that anything was rushed, nor that anything dragged. I saw this movie three times in the first week and a half, and it never bored me, and the pacing was the reason. And finally, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco were good in their roles as Mary Jane and Harry Osborn. Dunst didn't get a lot to work with script-wise, as her character wasn't given an enormous amount of depth, but she works with what she was given excellently and at least makes us understand why Peter loves her so much. Franco does a good job of showing Harry's struggle with his relationship with his father, and in a lot of ways, Harry is the character that develops the most throughout the film. All in all, an excellent film in every way. It is so good that I can only think of two extremely minor things that I didn't like. One was after the kiss, where they show Mary Jane in slow motion for a second, looking up. That was tacky and cliche, and it should have gone to the next scene after showing the sky with the rain falling. The other was when we get a closeup of M.J. swinging with Spidey. Spidey doesn't move whatsoever as M.J. is looking around, and it looks pretty awkward and fake. That's a total of about 3 seconds of film. Pretty minor flaws! Really close to perfectly done. A wonderful film. And as a side note, I can't believe people actually have beef with the organic web-shooters. Who cares? The way they happened naturally accounted for some of the funnier parts of the movie, so I've got no problem with it. And since when did comic book heroes need logic explanations, anyway? 10/10.
9.0~The amazing Spider-Man!!! jcirne Sign in Permalink Wow! My favorite hero on screen. I must admit I was very skeptic about this, after all I have most of Marvel comic books about Peter Parker (Spider-Man). But surprise! The movie is simply amazing. Very similar to the original characters, lots of action, very good argument. Maybe just a bit over the sentimental side, but even that follows the original story. I am a very happy man right now!
10.0~INCREDIBLE! yoyo21t Sign in Permalink This movie was, what can i say, INCREDIBLE! I was expecting as much from a spider-man movie, seeing how he is one of the greatest comic book/comic legend ever! Aside from some cheesy lines in exchanges of Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire, it was simply amazing. It was your classic comic book hero story, and i am happy to say it RULED! Along with the amazing adventure, came a message that many should remember when rising up in life- "Great power comes with great responsibilty."
10.0~WOW!Great Movie! DJ Kris Sign in Permalink ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** This was one of the few movies that I sworn to see for sure and i didn't wanted to search for spoilers.I liked the idea of seeing Spiderman,one of the coolest comic heroes ever on the big screen,especially after "X-men" set up new standards on comic adaptions. I was pleasantly suprised to see that Tobey Maguire wasn't so bad as i thought (my favourite canditate was...Freddie Prinze Jr.) but he surpased my wildest expectations.Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin delivers a great performance (his monologue/dialogue opposite his mirror was AWESOME!).Kirsten Dunst was sexy and believable.I didn't knew James Franco before but in this movie he delivers:He looks really like being Dafoe's young son (great casting here) and he has a great photogeny.And offcourse J.K.Simmons,whose performance and looking as J.J.Jameson made the audience in the theatre applause every time he was on screen. The performances were great,far superior than any other action movie and the great work on casting helped a lot.The effects weren't perfect but still they were very very good.The camera techniques used for this film blew my mind away!When Peter Parker hunts his uncle's murder through the skycrapers it is as if i were into a rollercoster!Breathtaking and in the same time never irritating. I don't know what many of you think but the last act in the cemetery,with Harry telling that he will take revenge upon Spiderman and Peter refusing the love of Mary Jane,is great job and something different than other movies (the hero wins the villain and takes the girl). My only instance has to do with two scenes.I don't want to be senseless but i didn't like the scene in the bridge,where the people of New York are throwing several object to the Green Goblin,saying that "if you mess up with Spiderman,you mess up with the whole New York city" or something.The second scene is the ending,where Spiderman crawls on the USA flag.Both scenes seem to be puted there just to satisfy the people after the tragical events of the 11th September.I don't have any problem against such of thing,movies are here to make people forget their everyday problems,but those two scenes seem to be just made up for this case.I hope i would not get missunderstood. Resuming,i would like to say that the movie gets 5/5 points for me.A great example of superb action movie.I hope that "X-men 2" and Ang Lee's "The Hulk" would follow the standards Spidey set on.And hopefully i beg that it would be a sequel!
10.0~How a Comic Book brought-to-life should be! disaacks3 Sign in Permalink A movie that appeals to both the purists and the casual viewer. While the romance may be a little too predictable and sappy, it still stands as a redeeming quality of the film. The action sequences were almost too fast to keep up with, but done extremely well. The history of the character was done as closely as today's Hollywood allows. An 'origin' story told as a 'coming of age' tale instead. Well worth your time...whether you're 16 or 60!
1.0~Spider-Man=Bad Moive zacarious Sign in Permalink What is all the hype about? This was just a bad, bad moive. Sitting through Spiderman was one of the most disappointing and excruciating experiences of my life. What was worse: the Green Goblins costume, the overly animated special effects, the non existent storyline, William Defoe's acting, or the gapping plot holes? Its a tough call. But the Green Goblin has to be one of the most uninteresting and dull villains in recent memory. Its sad to think that this movie has made so much money!
10.0~The perfect origin story for the not-so-perfect superhero! GoldenTalesGeek Sign in Permalink As a Spider-Man fan since childhood, I -like his legions of fans- were eagerly awaiting to see how the web-head's first adventure on the big screen was gonna fare. I knew from the get-go they were gonna tell his origin story, so we probably wouldn't see Spidey swinging through New York 'til at least 20 minutes into the movie. I liked the changes Sam Raimi made from the source material, especially the organic web shooters. The origins of Spider-Man and his nemesis the Green Goblin are also very well told. I especially love how the origins parallel one another. I also enjoyed the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde complexity they gave Norman and the Goblin. The cast is absolutely brilliant. I totally believed Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker and Spider-Man. I could definitely tell Willem Dafoe was enjoying himself playing Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin. Kirsten Dunst was perfect to play Mary Jane Watson. Cliff Robertson was so good as Uncle Ben, that I nearly cried when he was gone. I could go on... Danny Elfman's score does it all: It's full of action, adventure, romance, mystery and angst. I especially love the creepy quality of the Green Goblin's theme. It definitely felt like Elfman was sneaking in some of his love of Bernard Herrman into the picture. Not that there's anything wrong with that, mind you. The visual effects were absolutely fantastic for the time that this film came out. That final swing at the end really made me feel elated, yet I was also filled with a sense of wonder as to what they'd do in a second film. Long story short, what Sam Raimi did for "Spider-Man" is what Richard Donner did for "Superman". 10 out of 10 all the way!
9.0~Spider-Man tells a deep, entertaining story while doing the comic justice... PerpetualHaze Sign in Permalink I was blown away by Spider-Man. It is,by far, my favorite movie so far this year. I was more anticipated to see this film than any other in a long while. I read the comic book and followed the animated series in the 90's and this movie portrays the storyline so very thoroughly. It was the little things that made this movie great to me, i.e. when newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson mentions Peter Parker beating another photographer Eddie to the scoop on the Spider-Man photos. Those of you who follow Spider-Man know what I'm talking about. The dialogue of Norman Osborn with his inner demon, or should I say "goblin," was tremendous. This is very similar to that of the comic book and animated series. The pace, however, made the film for me. They gave the plot plenty of time to develop along with the character. Nothing was rushed like having Osborn transform into the Green Goblin in the first five minutes of the film. I walked away very satisfied. I even dug out my old comics and toys. This film meant a lot to me as a comic book fan. Spawn, X-Men, and Spider-Man were my three favorite comics during the 90's and I liked all the movies based on them, but even though X-Men was a very good movie, it didn't intrigue me as much as Spider-Man's deep yet simple journey into becoming a hero. No film based on a comic has done it as much justice as this one. ****1/2 This may be my new favorite movie.
5.0~lousy befcake71 Sign in Permalink the movie in it self was a major letdown i should of seen panic room with my 7 bucks its a shame for such great actors as willem dafoe and toby maguire to have such hollow characters. saying that the story in itself was decent i expected a rock em sock em ride, and what i got was a bogged down love story with a weak script. anyone who saw wonderboys with maguire will feel sorry for him. and as for dafoe he was the one bright spot as a perfect villain. As i sat in the theater i realized where the marketing went to the under 12 crowd which i thought was ridiculous since most of the kids there arent old enough to properly experience the true essence of what spiderman was for us.
10.0~The Amazing Spider-Man... You will be pleased true believers! Derek J Hunt Sign in Permalink Wow. Sam "Evil Dead" Raimi has crafted, what may be, the greatest film adaptation of a comic book to date. Tobey Maguire does an absolute perfect job of presenting Peter in a form that is fairly accurate to the comic books (sadly, Peter's sharp quips are almost completely absent). Willem Dafoe's performance as the Green Goblin truly captured the image I saw in the comic - a completely mad genius manifesting as pure evil... the perfect villain. Kirsten Dunst provides a decent representation of Mary Jane. Although she was not exactly as I pictured her when I read the comics, she does a great job with the material. J.K. Simmons was perfect as Jameson. The yelling, high strung, was conveyed perfectly exactly as I had pictured him. The cameo by long-time Raimi associate, Bruce Campbell, was a nice addition and garnered some applause during the film. The CG effects were a tad too fluid in some parts, but it fit perfect for the picture. It was almost as if you were going frame-by-frame through an old comic book. The action scenes were engrossing and very fun to watch. This combined with a perfect digital sound mix (Dolby Digital), made for a very entertaining experience. I have two grips with the film, one the blatant marketing shot (you will know it when you see it), and the theme by Danny Elfman. The theme was almost completely forgettable. The direction from Sam Raimi was great. Lots of decent shots and it fit perfect. It was nice to see a nod to Superman and a couple Evil-Dead style camera moves as well. Despite my two minor grips, I am giving the film a 10. I think this movie is easily the greatest comic book film to date. Thank you Sam. I know many other long time Spider-Man fans will be greatly appreciated. Nuff said.
7.0~Watchable, but.... rooboy84 Sign in Permalink .....The scenes aren't deep enough. The entertainment was 9/10, but what stops Spiderman from getting 10/10 for entertainment is a little lack of action scenes, especially of the Green Goblin. I'll most likely go see the sequel in a couple of years, let's hope it has more action. Otherwise, pretty good film! 75%
10.0~Do NOT miss this one! jalo8827 Sign in Permalink I grew up with all the COOL superheroes - Superman, Batman, Spiderman, The Green Hornet. Love those dark souls to death. So, when I heard they chose baby-faced Toby Maguire as the twilight lead in "Spiderman", I cringed and vowed not to see it. Well, I couldn't take it anymore, especially after hearing "Hero" (why do they ALWAYS wait until the last of the credits to play the best songs?). The dark possibilities drew me against my will, and I saw Spiderman today. Wow! WOW! Mom always said to watch out for the quiet ones as still waters run deep, and Maquire's performance as dear dark Spidey was no exception. He may appear cherubic, but there's definitely more going on than meets the eye. He was a wonderful surprise, and I live now for the sequel when an older, wiser Maguire takes on more evil in our world. His performance was powerful without being overpowering or over-the-top. He's an actor to be reckoned with. I've loved Kirsten Dunst's performances since I first laid eyes on her in "Interview With A Vampire" (as Claudia). She magically makes each role her own, and she's shown great range in her brief career. My only complaint with her role as MJ in "Spiderman" is superficial - she looks nearly asleep in many of her close-ups. (Perhaps pretty boy Maguire has her under his spell?) Willem Defoe let's it all hang out as Gobby (don't you just love Spidey's pet name for the nasty Green Goblin?) and he's a blast. He's completely convincing as the schizophrenic madman who tries to destroy Spidey and everyone he loves. I almost forgot he was the bad man a couple of times and felt sorry for him. This film would never have worked had it not been for the genius of Sam Raimi (another selling point for getting me to the theatre). He's shows more subtlety in "Spiderman" but his trademark slo-mo's are still there, and he takes what could have been another boring superhero flick and adds his unique brand of excitement (can you imagine "The Quick and The Dead" without Raimi's influence?) All in all, the film is a great afternoon romp, and I may go see it again (to hold me until the sequel). There are a couple of scenes that will bewilder the very young, though there were some in the audience and they didn't seem to be too disturbed. Still, I wouldn't chance it with anyone under 10. The Green Gob is pretty scary.
6.0~Lightweight version of the original Batman kismit Sign in Permalink Raimi does an excellent job on this film and it helps that Toby Maguire actually looks like a spider. A lot of what worked in Tim Burton's Batman works in this film. The most talented actor in the flick was the villain, and it showed the freak circumstances that created not only Spiderman, but his enemy. This show is definitely more for children than adults as the dronelike cartoon on TV is probably a source of more of the demographic than the comic book and your 5 year old is not going to find it as spooky as the darker Batman series.
8.0~A Bit Too Much Violence... DaDrill Sign in Permalink The casting was top notch, the special effects very good, although a bit suspect in a few swinging cases when Spidey seemed a bit out of proportion to his surroundings. The violence was aimed at teenagers who have been weaned on WWF baloney, and if Spidey can get easily cut, how does he live through a fire and getting slammed through numerous walls? I realize it's basically a cartoon, but even the kids with me commented on that aspect. There was a lot of random violence which minimized the value of human life, but that's how you make a bad guy bad these days. Not as good as the original Superman or Batman, although they are now very out of date due to our increased technology, but good enough that I will go see the sequel.
8.0~Good job, Sam Raimi! joshuadrake-91275 Sign in Permalink SPIDER-MAN is one of my favorite Comic Book films of all time and this is my review of the 2002 original. The film follows Peter Parker, an orphaned high schooler who pines after popular girl next door Mary Jane Watson. While on a science class field trip, Peter is bitten by a genetically- engineered "super spider". As a result, Peter gains superhuman abilities, increased strength, speed and the abilities to scale walls and generate organic webbing. After his beloved Uncle Ben is murdered, a murder Peter could have easily prevented, the teenager realizes that he must use his newfound abilities to protect New York City and he becomes Spider-Man. Meanwhile, wealthy industrialist Norman Osborn, the father of Peter's best friend Harry Osborn, subjects himself to an experimental performance-enhancing serum, which creates a psychotic and murderous split personality. Donning a military battlesuit, Norman becomes the freakish "Green Goblin", who begins to terrorize the city. Peter, as Spider-Man, now must do battle with the Goblin, all while trying to express his true feelings for Mary Jane. The feel of the comic book look and the film should be praised. Director Sam Raimi and his team really did a great job of bringing the Spider-Man character to life on the big screen was really amazing, and with today's CGI effects, they were about to make him jump and climb up walls. From the skyscrapers of New York to the warehouses to the film's web slinging sequences to the action sequences, this movie makes you feel like you wish you had the same powers as Spider-Man and the film has a great cast, who bring true performances to the characters they are playing. Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker and Spider-Man and who does an amazing job in the part and his performance won me over in this film and he would play the part for the next two films. When he is Peter Parker, he takes a serious approach, but once he is Spider-Man, man, he is super cool. The way that had his costume in this film was just wonderful, but the one thing that was missing was his web-shooters, but that was in the reboot. Willem Dafoe plays Norman Osborn and Green Goblin and he gives us a menacing, hilarious and serious villain who loves being evil and I will say, the costume is a bit stupid, but I like it though. It's not horrible, but it could have been worse, worse than George Clooney's Batman suit in Batman and Robin and that is for sure! The rest of the cast is just amazing. James Franco plays Harry Osborn and he does an amazing job. Rosemary Harris is sweet and was the perfect casting choice and he is just amazing and fantastic, as the grandmother and aunt of Peter Parker, Aunt May Parker and she does wonders. The late Cliff Robertson plays Uncle Ben and that was the best performance of his career. It was really amazing and fantastic to see him in that role, who would later be played by Martin Sheen, in the 2012 reboot. At last, but least, Kirsten Dunst plays the role of Mary Jane Watson and she gives an amazing performance in this film and her and Dunst won 2003 MTV Movie Award for Best Kiss and that kiss with them is one of my favorite moments in movies. The music by Danny Elfman is just amazing and fantastic. The theme is really amazing as hell and it is fantastic and so amazing. It was a really good musical score and I love his BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS musical scores and that was really fantastic. The visuals are amazing and the action sequences that I like the most are the fights between Spider-Man and Green Goblin and the fight choreography in those scenes were really well done and the dialogue in this movie is really wonderful and this script was written by David Koepp and he wrote a good script and this film is really amazing. Overall, SPIDER-MAN is a really amazing film and it is really fantastic and an amazing, spectacular, incredible, stunning and well done superhero film that does not get enough credit and it really gets a lot of things right and this was really fantastic and it is really amazing to see Spider-Man on the big screen. I could go for hours talking about how much I like this and talk about the action sequences, the dialogue, the effects, music, editing and the acting from the actors, but I know that IMDb has a word limit and I've got to keep this review short. Spider-Man is a really good and amazing comic book film and this will remain as one of my best superhero films of all time and one of my best superhero films on IMDb and it will not change. I'm giving this film a rating of an 8 out of 10.
3.0~Very Overrated Movie seaton-1 Sign in Permalink This film is so overrated. Spiderman is a very bland superhero because he is just another geek that transforms into his alter ego. This movie lacks the political undertones of X-Men and the darkness of Batman. There is no depth or mythological references like in Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, or Harry Potter. The leading man and lady are straight out of a teeny bopper magazine. I would only recommend this movie to anyone who does not like to think or to be challenged in any way.
8.0~The long-awaited big screen incarnation of the 40-year-old Marvel Comics superhero flickfreaks-70695 Sign in Permalink The pictures's first, and better, half is devoted to Peter's makeover from campus dweeb to physically unique righter-of-wrongs. While visiting a Columbia U. science lab, Peter is bitten by a mutant blue-and-red spider. Next day, his vision is perfect and he's newly buff, and it isn't long before he discovers he's capable of spinning industrial- strength webs and walking up buildings. He first uses his new strength and acrobatic skills to dispatch Mary Jane's a-hole b.f. in a school fight, then thinks to impress her by earning money in a wrestling challenge matched against a monster named Bone Saw. This entire apprenticeship section was always going to live or die on the charm and appeal of the actor playing Peter, and the initial sweet sensitivity Maguire conveys, followed by the growing thrill of self-discovery of his new superhuman abilities, proves captivating. Peter's strictly Lark use of his powers comes to an unwelcome end when his uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), who with wife May (Rosemary Harris) has raised the boy, is killed in a Manhattan carjacking. Donning Spider-Man gear and swinging via self-generated threads from building to building like an urban Tarzan, he dispatches the culprit while deftly eluding police seizure. Already in this early major action sequence, though, something feels a bit off; the movement seems jerky, the pursuit unnecessarily hurried, so that while the sight of the young crime-buster gallivanting through the nocturnal canyons of New York City is impressive, it lacks the desired visceral thrill. Naturally, Spider-Man requires an adversary, and he gets one in the form of the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), an Armour-plated fiend who zips around like a rabid snowboarder on a heavily armed glider dropping pumpkin bombs on uncomprehending foes. Like Spider-Man, the Goblin has a human identity, that of Norman Osborn, an ousted corporate arms manufacturer who becomes a Jekyll-and-Hyde upon consuming an experimental formula of his own devising. Unlike Peter, Norman can't control when he slips into his alternate self, and Dafoe's best moments come when the two sides of his personality argue with one another and flip back and forth as quickly as a light switch. Unfortunately, when "Spider-Man" settles into full superhero mode an hour in, the conventional contours of David Koepp's script come fully to the fore. With the Green Goblin committing such heinous acts as blitzing a World Unity Festival in Times Square top-lining Macy Gray and threatening to drop Mary Jane and a Roosevelt Island tram loaded with kids into the East River, he and Spider-Man face off in increasingly standard-issue good guy/bad guy fashion, with no bigger issues to give their rivalry special import. Further deflating the balloon is an abundance of over-cranked digital physical action that's singularly lacking in grace or the feel of real movement, human or animal. Welcome compensation comes in the form of Peter's continued pursuit of Mary Jane, who remains oblivious to his dual personality for some time but eventually warms to his newfound confidence. For many teenage boys, picture's highlight will not be found among the action interludes but rather in the scene of Mary Jane, her flimsy shirt drenched by rain, peeling back the lower part of Spider-Man's face-mask in order to kiss him while he's hanging upside down in a dark street. Ironically, it's when "Spider-Man" sticks to simple human interaction that the film breathes and ingratiates itself. Chemistry between Maguire and the winning Dunst is excellent, and there are good moments, too, between Maguire and James Franco, who plays Norman's unhappy son and Peter's only friend at school, as well as with Robertson and Harris as Peter's doting substitute parents. Cackling behind his armoured Goblin costume, Dafoe is stuck with routine villainy when not writhing through his transformations, while standout supporting turn is served up by J.K. Simmons, who brilliantly catches his piece's comic book origins while snapping out funny one-liners as a cynical newspaper editor. Physically imposing production is notable for Neil Spisak's production design, which involves considerable invention but also allows New York City to play itself without Gotham City-like stylisation. James Acheson's costumes, beginning with the terrific ribbed Spider-Man outfit, are splendid, Danny Elfman's score punches things up in customary form, and Don Burgess' lensing, while accommodating the countless effects, makes the actors look great.
8.0~Let it pave the way! thedarktruth Sign in Permalink I really enjoyed the movie! As did the other people who went with me. I am a spiderman freak..My friends are not. The greatest thing I can say about the movie is that it has proven that Comic books sell..even in the movies! I can't wait for the Hulk and Daredevil!
10.0~Raimi Delivers the Goods jhclues Sign in Permalink It may be a story lifted from the pages of a comic book, but with some strong performances, a focused story and some great F/X, director Sam Raimi puts blood in the veins of one of the best superheroes ever to hit the big screen. And let's face it, right now the world needs just such a character; someone who can right wrongs, stave off injustice, assuage fears and give people a sense of security in a world seemingly gone amuck at times, and thanks to the magic of the movies we have him now. His name is `Spider-Man.' Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a normal, if not typical teenager; mature beyond his years, he would rather attend a science fair than go to a rave, he lives with his aunt and uncle (Rosemary Harris, Cliff Robertson) and has been in love with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), the girl who lives next door, since about the first grade. `MJ,' however, doesn't even know he exists; except for an occasional `hello,' they barely know one another. But though Peter doesn't know it, all of that-- Peter's life-- is about to undergo a radical change. On a field trip to a science lab, Peter is bitten by a spider-- not just any spider, but one that's been genetically altered. And when he wakes up the next morning, he finds himself changed; it's not exactly Kafka's Metamorphosis, but he does have new life and new energy, and beginning with his vision (he suddenly can see clearly without his glasses), he gradually discovers that he has certain physical abilities that do not necessarily coincide with the kind of changes consistent with a young man of his age. Like being able to spin webs from his wrists and climb up the side of buildings. And now all he has to do is learn how to control and use his newly found prowess, and decide what to do with it all. Which he does very quickly, when circumstances provide him with a motive and a personal agenda that leads him to become, as Peter himself puts it, `Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.' With this film, Raimi takes a page out of the Tim Burton Book and gives us a character that is convincing and real, because he shows us the man first, and then the superhero. Like Burton did in the original `Batman,' in which Michael Keaton played to the man, rather than to the `bat,' Raimi takes Maguire down the same path, having him play to Peter, rather than the `spider.' And it makes all the difference in the world. Instead of merely thrusting a full-blown superhero onto the screen, Raimi first develops a plausible storyline (screenplay by David Koepp) complete with a central character to whom the audience can relate, and once that is established it enables the audience to suspend disbelief and go with the flow when Peter emerges as Spider-Man. The F/X are incredible, and Raimi uses the stunning visual aspect of the film to great effect, but it would all be for naught without the solid core of believable characters he puts into place and then uses as a foundation upon which to build the spectacular. It's reality based, but imaginatively presented-- Raimi definitely knows what works and how to entertain and involve his audience, which he certainly does here. And this is arguably Raimi's best work yet. When it was announced that Tobey Maguire had landed the role of Spider-Man, you could almost hear the collective audible gasp of fans everywhere. Tobey Maguire? Spider-Man? !!! But-- as it turns out-- it was inspired casting, as Maguire is perfect as everybody's favorite web-slinger. In fact, hopefully he's been signed to a multi-picture deal, because now it is impossible to imagine anyone else in the role. Without question, Maguire IS Spider-Man. His appearance, the way he carries himself-- his entire countenance-- combined with his attitude and the subtle way he expresses himself, are all part and parcel of what brings Peter Parker and Spider-Man to life. Maguire, as he has demonstrated previously in such films as `The Ice Storm' and `The Cider House Rules,' has a naturally pleasing and accessible personality that serves him so well in the characters he creates, and none more so than with his portrayal of Peter. He has the talent and ability to aptly convey that `ordinary person under extraordinary circumstances' scenario and make it believable, which is exactly what was needed to make this film successful; and Maguire nails it with a performance that is introspective and affecting, and it makes the character-- as well as the film-- work. Willem Dafoe also contributes to the film's appeal with his portrayal of Norman Osborn, aka, the `Green Goblin.' Not since the Joker sparred with Batman has the screen had such a memorable villain; and again, Dafoe first plays to the man-- to Osborn-- and then to the `Goblin,' which puts a real face on Evil and gives the character the depth that makes him more than just superficially `bad.' Defoe goes that extra mile to make a Osborn real, and deserves credit for giving him real substance, rather than being satisfied with a one dimensional character that has nothing going on beneath the surface. The Goblin is a complex character, and Dafoe plays him perfectly. Kirsten Dunst had something of a challenge with her role of Mary Jane, as the character is somewhat ambiguous; on one hand, she plays a pivotal role in motivating Spider-Man, while her own part in the grand scheme of things remains uncertain until the end. And only then are we given a glimpse of the direction in which MJ may go, and it will be interesting to see how the character develops in the next installment, now that the groundwork has been ably laid by Dunst. In the final analysis, `Spider-Man' is a winner that is going to attract a huge following; this is one film that definitely has legs. 10/10.
3.0~Very ordinary iedmonds Sign in Permalink I watched a pre-view of this at the weekend. As far as super-hero movies go and the amount of money spent on it. This was a most disappointing movie. I wasn't expecting much from this film other than hoping for an action packed movie. However the only action in the entire film was a couple of fight scenes and watching Spider-Man swing along some buildings!. There was never going to be a great script or great acting. But was hoping for some excitement. I think if you wanted to compare recent super hero movies your better renting out XMEN. As that has great special effects too but has enough things happening to keep you interested. Poor
10.0~What a great movie! smp31 Sign in Permalink Spider-Man was much better than expected. I knew it would be good, but i didnt think that it would be that good. Toby plays the part to a tee. I cant think of any actor that would have been better for that role. I heard that Sam didnt want people to think that Spiderman was a dork or not tough enough. Well, spiderman kicks major ass, and looks good doing it. I cant wait till the second one....and third.
6.0~Big hype, small delivery nanschmidt2000 Sign in Permalink Overall this was a good film not a great one. I, like so many others, grew up reading spiderman comics. With all of the hype preceeding this film there was no way it could live up to the expectation. The film had good (not great) action. After about the first 30 minutes the film began to drag on. However, as with so many trilogy films the first installment lays the groundwork, the next 2 usually surpass the first in storyline and action. Overall I would give the film 6 stars for sticking to the comic.
1.0~Just ok. Not the greatest comic book movie. Kellyann-1 Sign in Permalink Spiderman was just ok. It's not the greatest comic book movie. I still prefer the original Batman movie, Superman and The Daredevil movie. Spiderman had a few cool scenes but overall I was disappointed. Tobey was pretty good. Kirsten, uhh, liked her in Virgin Suicide, wasn't digging her in this role. Fell flat in my opinion.
9.0~Inspiring stuff from comic book genius sliverdeshard Sign in Permalink How often does a comic actually work well on the screen? Batman was good but, this is better. Special effects, quality performances from Maguire and Defoe, a beautiful young and upcoming girl (who looks great in a kimono!). Even the crazy comic lines are carried off well by Maguire, who manages somehow to carry off the well muscled nerd. And the little bits of Matrix style imagery fit perfectly into the film. A great one for curling up on the sofa with, its a lot more than just an action movie. Enjoy!
8.0~Courtesy, your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. ayushman98 Sign in Permalink As a die-hard fan of Spider-Man, I'll start by saying it still has its comic based charms and connections after 13 years. It might seem a bit cheesy at times but that's no big deal, all prequels feel the same. Spider-Man was one of the few awesome superheroes back then, along with the X Men. Comic book adaptations: 9/10 (The only freely adapted thing I suppose was his natural webbing, other than that, quite spot on.) Characters: 9/10 (I guess an argument can be made that Andrew Garfield is a better Spider-Man/ Peter Parker. Still, Spider-Man 1 and 2 haven't worn off yet with an 89 and a 94 on Rotten Tomatoes. Tobey fits in pretty well, along with the rest of the delightful cast. Soundtracks: 10/10 (Danny Elfman's soundtracks were essential and promising) Action: 8/10 (They were pretty impressive, but it's still just the prequel, it does have a lot of potential though.) Origin story: 10/10 (I could easily relate to it, it was damn near perfect) Overall rating: 8
6.0~Movie was much better than I though it would be. FoxEGibbs2002 Sign in Permalink There was a bit of a likeable love store mixed in, the special effects were done well, and the conflict seemed possible. I enjoyed watching this movie. It's a good one to see; for a lot of adults as well as children. I would imagine that those that enjoy fantasy would enjoy it.
6.0~Go see this movie ONLY if your kids want to... dima_frenkel Sign in Permalink It is not even remotely as good as the Batman was. Some moments are too predictable even though not bad. Special effects are NOTICABLE, which is normally the sign of slightly-above-average quality of special effects. The ending is awful. Looks like they got tired of making a good movie and ended things in the worst way possible. "With great power comes great responsibility...", US flag at the end.... give me a break!!! It was not supposed to be THAT kind of movie! There are many other very good movies to watch if you want to feel patriotic and proud. To me it looked a little ironic and a little inappropriate. Bottom line: not bad overall but sometimes very stupid.
10.0~"Spider-Man" Rocks! stormintk Sign in Permalink This is definitely one of the best superhero films I have seen! I was looking forward to seeing this film and I was not disappointed! The dialog, writing and plot flowed very well and remained true to the original Marvel Comics vision of Spiderman. A lot of the special effects are computer generated, but that does not detract from the film. I highly recommend seeing this film!
7.0~Superman's early years? MOscarbradley Sign in Permalink While "Spiderman" may be the darkest, most morally ambiguous, (and probably the best), superhero movie since "Batman Returns" it's hard to shake off the feeling that it is nothing more than a reprise of the Superman franchise rather than something original and out there on it's own. Director Sam Raimi may have given the film the look and feel of a Batman movie, down to the sets and Spiderman's tight-fitting costume but his derring-do, his heroic rescues and his inability to tell the girl he loves who he is, all belong to "Superman". Tobey Maguire is a nicely oddball bit of casting as Spiderman. He makes the teenage avenger a more morally ill-at-ease character than an older actor may have done and Kirsten Dunst is a plucky, spirited, if under-written heroine but as the Green Goblin Willem Dafoe doesn't quite cut the mustard even if he does get the best special effects.
8.0~Cool flick lawnboy1977 Sign in Permalink Definitely a good movie. I was skeptical like everyone of Tobey Maguire as Spiderman. However, he delivered. This film would have sucked if there was some overpowering hunk playing Peter Parker As much as I like guys like The Rock and Arnold, it just wouldn't have worked. I can't wait for a sequel.
9.0~He's not a bug .. he's an ARACHNID ;-) paulandmorganhamm-1 Sign in Permalink This used to be my favorite movie until I watched it more closely. It's pretty good. Tobey MacGuire did a good job! But the rest of the people in the movie were pretty annoying. I like the part where the New Yorkers are throwing stuff at the Green Goblin to try to save Spiderman, MJ, and the kids. There's a little too much violence though..a lot of little kids watched the movie (even though it's PG-13). The parents were probably mad at some of the jokes they said. But I guess that's what they get for taking their kids to a PG-13 movie. The guy who played Harry was a good actor, too. If you compare Mr. Osbourne and Harry they totally look like they're related!!! Overall it was pretty good.
7.0~Fans of the comic book will have a good time. claurell Sign in Permalink As far as authenticity besides a few character changes in appearance and skill level the movie did do the comic justice. With a cameo from the creator Stan Lee, and also some serious characters mentioned for maybe future sequels such as Eddie Brock aka Venom and the Lizard. Special effects were amazing, they did a really nice job showing the webslinger flying around New York, along with The Green Goblin on his glider. All and all it was good flick with good performances from Maquire and Defoe along with Dunst.
8.0~Inspired and exciting example of the modern super-hero film Wuchakk Sign in Permalink Released in 2002 and directed by Sam Raimi, "Spider-Man" stars Tobey Maguire as geeky teen Peter Parker, who is bit by a radioactive spider and acquires spider-like powers. Kirsten Dunst plays his wannabe girlfriend, Mary Jane, while James Franco plays his best friend and rival, Harry Osborn. Willem Dafoe is on hand as the schizophrenic Norman Osborn, who's also the Green Goblin. Cliff Robertson & Rosemary Harris play Peter's Uncle & Aunt while J.K. Simmons appears as newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson. Although it was 2000's "X-Men" that ushered in the modern superhero film, it was "Spider-Man" that drove it home. The movie remains an exhilarating example of the genre and is markedly superior to the merely competent reboot "The Amazing Spider-Man," which came out just 10 years later. Compare the costumes, for instance, particularly the masks; there's no contest. There are some flaws: The second half isn't as compelling as the first and the apartment fire sequence is eye-rolling in that there's zero smoke in the abode. Then there are changes from the comics, some which work great (e.g. scrapping Spidey's web-shooters in favor of intrinsic web-powers) and some which are just acceptable (e.g. MJ's noticeably different disposition). But such quibbles are made up for by the movie's overall mojo. Simmons nails it as the quirky & kinetic Jameson. "Spider-Man" remains the second best Spider-Man film, second only to "Spider-Man 3" (2007), not including "Spider-Man: Homecoming" (2017), which I haven't seen yet. The film runs 121 minutes and was shot in New York City & Los Angeles, as well as a few other areas in New York and Southern Cal, e.g. the cemetery scene in Valhalla, NY. The screenplay was written by David Koepp. GRADE: A-
8.0~Good movie, except for one odd detail... GH3 Sign in Permalink Spoiler Alert When I went to see Spider-Man I was very excited to see what Sam Rami had in store for me. Alone from his great Evil Dead movies, I wondered what he could do with such a high budget and different script. From a directorial standpoint he succeeded and the movie was great as a result. It had lots of action, especially considering this was the first Spider-Man and a lot of introduction of character had to be done, etc. Everything was going great, until the end when MJ, played by the BEEEEEEEEEAUTIFUL Kirsten Dunst, proclaimed her love for Pete Parker. Now, I don't care what genre of movie this is or what story plot came before the scene, no straight guy and I mean no straight guy is pulling the "let's just be friends" line in this situation. It blew my mind. The way I figure, if I'm Tobey Maguire, the studio needs me for the next 2 Spider-Man movies, so I go for a script change that lets me get Kirsten. I don't think it would change anything that much, plus it would make a lot more sense. Let's face it, there is a better chance of a radioactive spider biting someone, giving him super powers and him using them to become a super hero, as opposed to a man declining Kirsten Dunst's offerings of love. Good movie though.
10.0~the greatest super hero movie ever kylenygiants Sign in Permalink Spiderman is the greatest superhero movie ever. When i started to watch this, i was just thinking a mediocre movie. But after i saw it, i was in shock. I couldn't wait for the second one too come out. of course it wasn't as good as the first one though but it was good. Now i can't wait for the third one. This is one of my favorite movies. It was great. The special effects were good. The plot was awesome. There was no boring part in the movie. The cast was cool. Everything was cool in this movie. I thought the battle over time square could have been longer though. That was the only thing i would change in the movie. i would give it 10/10 stars
7.0~Slightly disappointing RikWriter Sign in Permalink Could have been the best superhero movie ever made...and came very close, but just seemed to lose steam. The initial hour or so, when Peter is discovering his powers, is excellent, but once he puts the suit on the movie seems to run out of gas. Add to that incredibly bad dialogue, poor costume design for the Green Goblin, a very bad performance as Mary Jane by Kirsten Dunst and inadequate character-building of Uncle Ben (why should we feel Peter's grief when it is never shown that the two are that close?) and you have just another summer blockbuster...entertaining, but very forgettable.
9.0~Best Marvel Film I Have Seen So Far. jerekra Sign in Permalink Spiderman is the best Marvel Film that I have seen in my life. It does a good job showing how Peter Parker becomes Spiderman and lays a good foundation for the series. Peter Parker is a smart student who is often picked on by other kids at school. However, after he gets bitten by a radioactive spider he becomes Spiderman his life changes. Soon Parker learns that with great power comes great responsibility. I think this film has a great flow to it. Not even ten minutes in Parker gets bitten by the spider that turns him into spiderman. That is good because then the rest of the film consists of Parker learning how to use his powers and get in a lot of great action. The action is great in this film. They really did a good job of using CGI in this film. At times you can tell that spiderman is not real and is computer animated, but for the most part everything looks good. I think Tobey Mcguire does a pretty good job as Spiderman. In the comics Spiderman is really funny, full of a lot of great jokes. However for the most part SPiderman is not that witty in this film and I think that a lot has to do with Mcguire not being a really funny actor. Good actor, but not humorous really. I do think that Mcguire makes a better Peter Parker than he does Spiderman. Overall I would give him a seven out of ten as spiderman. I think that the main villain in this film, the Green Goblin, was actually really good. I wondered who they would use as Spidermans first film villain and I think they made a good choice. Goblin gets to do a lot of fighting with Spiderman and also has a good back story, so he is a deep villain. A few complaints. I did not like how they had Spiderman get the ability to shoot webs from his body. I think it is better how in the comics he made his own web shooters. Just my opinion though. The comics of Spiderman are better than the film but that is the case for most super hero films I think. So this is the best Marvel Film that I have seen. Great action, good flow, and also a good villain. Highly recommended.
4.0~Wait for it to come out on video. fruchtman Sign in Permalink First the good: Great effects, good fight scenes, fantastic acting, direction, and cinematography. Now the bad: Formula, formula, formula. This movie was as designed and engineered as N-SYNC. The producers didn't even try to disguise their quest for money with an interesting plot. And the ugly: The smarmy love-story. It made me want to wretch. How the actors kept straight faces while reciting some of the corniest and sappiest lines I've ever heard is worthy of an Academy Award. I haven't seen anything so maudlin since the Sammy Maudlin show.
9.0~Authentic and Fun Recreation of Marvel's Most Popular Super-Hero LeonLouisRicci Sign in Permalink Director Sam Raimi and Actor Tobey Maguire manage to Formulate 40 Years of Web-Slinging with an Origin Story that is remarkably True to the First-Run Series Created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko that started in, Believe It or Not...Amazing Adult Fantasy #15 in the Early Sixties. It didn't Take Long for Spider-Man to become Marvel's #1 Seller and one of the Most Popular Comic-Book Heroes of All Time. This Film captures the Angst and the Adventure, the Trials and Tribulations of Peter Parker/Spider-Man that made the Comic a Super-Hit. The Movie Looks Great and Director Raimi Sneaks In some of his Off-Beat Humor and Edgy Action. The 2002 CGI is Milked for all its worth and at times is Stunning and You will Believe that a Spider-Man can "Fly". Willem DaFoe as Mr. Osborn/The Green Goblin is Fine, although He Waivers sometimes (in costume) of Batty Beyond Belief. The Slugfests between Goblin and Spidey are Brutal and Visceral adding some Weight to the Web-Head's more Light-Hearted Roundup of the City's Street Thugs. Kirsten Dunst is Serviceable as Mary Jane, Peter's Love Interest and James Franco as Harry Osborn (Goblin's Son) is as usual, Stiff to say the Least. Other Characters from the Comics are on hand to Flesh Things Out a bit. Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben gets to Recite Stan Lee's Famous Line..."With great power comes great responsibility." There's Aunt Mae, and J.Jonah Jameson, the Stingy Editor of the Daily Bugle Newspaper, who is a Returning Character in the Comics as a Nemesis of both Pete and Spidey. Overall, this is a Grand Entertainment full of Fun and Danger. Colorful to the Max and a Really-Cool Cinematic Recreation of the Beloved Spider-Man.
1.0~god-awful loveisweakness Sign in Permalink i have seen a lot of movies in my time, but this is one of the worst. they bastardized the story of spider man, relied far too much on 3d graphics, and somehow made the worst superhero ever even more boring to sit through
6.0~Review: Spider-Man (2002) B-R-M Sign in Permalink Apart from the disproportionate action by the annoying zooms, then, Spider-Man is a Film enjoyable, it is, the problem is its script half opplausado, (ie, medium incoherent), in the film is never explained in depth why Peter wants to be a Supehéroe Out of the fact about the murder of his uncle (who killed him tégnicamente by his fault) Likewise, the affection that has to MJ is re forced, the scenes seen in the movie never show the true affection that Peter has to MJ, (not counting the final scene that is Desprop Orcional first of all that was seen in the film) while, the villain is little memorable (something like the Largarto in the amazing but more mediocre) I say. If Norman Osborn wanted to escape the curse of the Green Goblin, minimum he has asked for help, (ask for help almost to his death, which makes the character a unibidimensional) or if you want to explore well his motives of remaining the Green Goblin, and his scene of death It is forced because it is not explored very well with its character, which makes it a moltiviero, (Sad scene with shoer) it was not necessary the fact to kill itself when trying to kill Spidey, the action is somewhat decent but annoying, when a character strikes makes a kind of Zoom, (This is shown in the final battle in the abandoned English). Although on the other hand, Maguire does well to Spider-Man and knows the basics of the performance, what does not convince me are his facial expressions where they are half subrealists or make strange sounds (like one that makes in the final battle where the Green Goblin gives a blow and Spidey the M Walk away). MJ I feel that it was wasted, I say, not explore much of the character beyond that has problems with his family and that is the love interest of our protagonist. Norman is half unibidimensional, shows a lot, tells Little. Cobwebs seem to be loosened by the effects that look somewhat false and are badly positioned. However, and continuing with the character of Peter, then, is well developed seeing, of as it is questioned why it has to be a superhero, pity that this was not explored very well in depth, out of the murder of his uncle, therefore, 0 reasons to be spidey. 3/5.
10.0~Oh Hell Yes personguyman Sign in Permalink Alright, so I saw this movie this movie on Saturday with the expectation that I was going to love it, I had loved the cartoon from the mid 90's (which was the cartoon that I grew up with) so I went in wanting my socks to be blown off. And I was not disappointed, even the fact that I was in the front row and to the side could not reuin this movie for me. The action sequences were amazing, the lines where memorable and the acting was just great. If you ever liked spiderman, as the comics or one of the old shows or had a spiderman fix that you liked whatsoever, or even if you just like movie's with great action, then I suggest this movie: 10/10
8.0~Better Than Darkman SpecialAgentMaxwell Sign in Permalink Upon hearing that Sam "Xena" Raimi was directing the big screen treatment of Spider Hyphen Man, I was shocked. Of course I loved the Evil Dead series, but everything he's done since then has bit the big one. However I really did enjoy Spider Hyphen Man. It had some amazing action sequences and an okay plot which is all you can really ask for in a big summer movie. As for Mary Jane though, I just don't get why people think you have to be a damn supermodel to be in a movie like this. She was fine. Before I go I do have to vent two gripes...One, the CG used in certain scenes (i.e. when Peter goes after the robber) was a little too XBOX for me. And two, Mary Jane is a tramp! I lost count of how many boyfriens she mowed through. Overall though, very fun.
6.0~Nothing Great... Kind of Dissapointing... malcolmallancrossfield Sign in Permalink I was looking foreward to seeing "Spider-Man". All of the great reviews, being on the IMDb top 250, and, last but not least, making over 800 million dollars worldwide. I just watched it, and I don't see what all of the fuss is about. Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate it. I was just expecting something "great'' and ''amazing'', but nothing in this movie made me say "wow". Acting is solid, yet not oscar worthy. Story is okay, yet predictable, but special effects are actually pretty good, but there not the best. You could tell when spider-man was swinging from building to building that it was computer generated. The thing that kind of makes me angery is that a movie like this, totally predictable, not surprising, and nothing oscar worthy what so ever, gets on the IMDb top 250 movie-list, and an amazing movie like Black Hawk Down (2001) with great acting, great story, great directing, great editing, great sound and a story that actually tells us something, doesn't even get on the top 250 list. Rent the DVD and watch the special features. My rating: 6*'s/10*'s. I gave it so much because i liked the acting and directing.
10.0~Just Plain Radical...hella radical deathcloset Sign in Permalink wow! this movie was great! it followed the comic nicely and, despite the Pseudo-cheeze - i.e. people pointing and saying, "there he is!", the movie managed to be just excellent! I will absolutely, without a doubt go see this movie again.
9.0~It's Fun! OctaviaGold Sign in Permalink Spiderman is a superb comic book adaptation. Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast as Peter Parker and Willem Dafoe is brilliant as the Green Goblin. While some have criticized it's cartoonish fight sequences, I feel that they were wonderfully done in such a way that makes them slightly inconceivable. After all, this is a film based on a comic book that has a premise which is a little bit out there. Another great casting choice was that of James Franco as Harry. He and Willem Dafoe look so much like father and son it's astounding. Kirsten Dunst gives another great performance to her resume, I'm a big fan of hers. She plays her roles beautifully with great charm. She really is the girl next door, having looks that aren't spectacularily drop-dead gorgeous and a smile that will melt your heart. The plot is delightful, my favorite line of the film being "We'll meet again, Spiderman!" It's so deliciously cheesy and yet it works so well. All in all, I had fun at this film and that's exactly what it should be, an exciting night out that leaves you with a smile on your face.
10.0~It still holds up really well, after about 14 years vivekchandra007 Sign in Permalink Saw it again, last night, after a long time and it still managed to catch my attention and I noticed such small (intrinsic) details embedded throughout the movie that it looks like Sam Raimi really spun an amazingly entertaining movie through strings of comic-web. One of the best origin stories that like an old wine, keeps getting better because it is laden with story, a soul that only gets more enlightened by CGI. Sam Raimi researched the material well and it shows, be it having some inside jokes, Easter eggs and how he got the hero got name. The first 30 minutes is simply the best "origin of origin", a superhero flick has shown till date. Best thing is he got so much comfortable with it that he made even amazing second part (one of the best sequels till date) (tied up with T2) but still nothing beats an origin story because it shows "Even you can be".
10.0~Spider Man 2002 milo3334 Sign in Permalink There is something very endearing about Toby and Kirsten in this Spider Man 2002 movie. Their acting represented truth and honesty and that is something.
10.0~Absolutely unmissable! FrancesD Sign in Permalink Having waited for well over a year for the release of this film I had a terrible fear that it wouldn't live up to my expectations. I was wrong to be concerned. This film lived up to all of my expectations - and then some! I am usually sceptical when it comes to comic book adaptations, mainly because many of them have a tendency to play things more for laughs, believing somehow that the movie going public won't accept the possibility of a "real-life" superhero. This may be true but everyone would like to believe such realities are somehow a possibility. The actors performances were very impressive. Toby Maguire put in a trademark astounding performance. But the real star of this film was William Dafoe. Despite some occasionally ropy dialogue Dafoe was breath-takingly good as The Green Goblin. Perhaps the only real problem that I had with the film was the Green Goblin's costume. I'm not entirely sure whether it was too 'cartoony' or it just transferred to CGI badly but something seemed wrong with it. It didn't always fit in with the rest of the scene perhaps as well as it could have. But this is a minor issue and in no way taints the overall feeling of the film. Finally, kudos to Raimi for adding the original Spider-man theme at the end of the credits - a huge cheer went up in the cinema!
10.0~ummm....AWSOME!!!!!!!! supremesuperior Sign in Permalink I mean what should i say its simply da mofo best movie out there "now" Damn i heard people complaining about "its a love story" and "they made a love story out of it too" well people F**** you man you got bad taste but hey thats what you think =) I think it was a pretty good idea with the love story in it and there wasnt sooooo much love in there...i mean thats a part of the storie u know....now i dont wanna complain all a long.... This is a great great GREAT movie. The ideas were great the special effects are great.. hell the movie is great. And i think to that they did a good job on remaking the movie. The first movie i enjoyed but this one man is just awsome. Spiderman 2 is in the making and im verry excited to see it... peace ps:sorry about my spelling im from germany =)
8.0~Satisfying ayric Sign in Permalink Satisfying but not mindblowing. More could have been done with the excellent material, but it still portrays the story well with quite some depth shown particularly in the ending. Parker's inner conflicts are central as they should be. The CGI is so-so compared to Jurassic Park, which is now nine years old. But the costume is amazing. This is a good introduction to the sequel, which will be better. Rating - 8/10
9.0~Good, but not perfect SnobbyDude Sign in Permalink This was a great movie. I remember seeing it a couple of times in theaters and telling everyone to go see it. The story is great-I thought the twist in the beginning was great where Peter Parker learns that ignoring his responsibility (with great power comes great responsibility) causes grief in his personal life. I hear that this is similar to what happened to him in the comics as well, but I wouldn't know, having never read the comic. I also loved the action scenes. I understand that a lot of CGI was used, but I have no idea where it was used. It's all transparent to me, so I think they did a pretty convincing job. I'm glad that the action was fast and they didn't recycle that slow-motion action that was first seen in the matrix. Watching someone leap in the air, have the camera stop, and pan is now a trick that has outstayed its welcome. Fast action conveys a sense of urgency and excitement and is suits this movie. There are a few strikes against this movie. One thing I wasn't crazy about was the sugar-coated feel of it. There are a number of scenes that feel like they were tweaked to lure in the teenaged girls. I found myself cringing at some scenes that were a little cheesy and I didn't feel that happening in some of the other, more recent superhero movies. It doesn't reach the heights of cheesyness that Titanic does, but I would have liked a more serious spiderman. It doesn't have to be as serious as the Hulk or Daredevil, but maybe something in between would feel right. I would also like a more interesting villain, with a real motive for his behavior. The costume was a little silly too...I just wasn't afraid of him. A good villain should instill fear in your heart. Maybe these issue will be addressed in Spiderman 2. I'd give this movie a 10 and subtract a point for some of the dialog and the power-ranger outfit of the goblin.
10.0~I've never had so many thrills at a movie before.. Thalya Sign in Permalink There's so much I could say about this movie and it wouldn't be enough. Let me put it to you this way. After seeing it last night I wanna see Spiderman 4 (after seeing this one 10 more times). And I thought XMen was a well made comic book movie, but this one had an amazing comic book feel to it, requisite episodes and all, and not just had the feel, but felt like you were inside the comic world and seeing more than the blocks would show you. You saw the meaning of ZOOM and KABLAM. The story was an excellent coming of age as you saw Peter evolve into the hero that is Spidey. Something I particularly liked was how Peter was Peter, but once in Spidey's suit, had Peter's voice but which felt exactly right as Spidey's too (kudos to Tobey Maguire). I had only seen a bit of the Spiderman cartoons when I was a kid in the 80s, but the villains had always seemed stupid and too whimsical/fantastical to really care about. Not so here. Willem Dafoe was superb at creating a real menace, A REAL MENACE! Something that was unpredictable and could snap at any moment, adding tons of suspense to any scene where Norman was in control, especially the one where he hugged Harry. In superhero movies you always know that the hero will beat the villain and that there's usually an Achilles heel, but not so here. Here the villain was clearly the stronger of the two, and while our hero has spider-strength and all, he's still human and less armored. It makes you appreciate the victory all the more. As for the score, it was generic (no themes). In a good way. Compared to something like FOTR where most of the emotion came from the score, the score stayed in the background save for some Green Goblin touches, letting the emotional quality of the story take center stage. I came to the movie needing a respite from life stresses, and heavy as they were, I got sucked in by the story. Not to mention it may have been formulaic, but I couldn't tell. I'm not up to snuff on the whole Green Goblin mythos, but it was great to see the chaotic villain calling the shots in a wild and fastpaced world where anything could happen. Even when things were predictable and you could tell what was going to be said, something that followed brought the cliche back into reality (the scene where MJ & Peter talk outside their houses for instance). Here is the cultural mythology we've been lacking for some time, and while we're living in a golden age when comic book movies are all the rage (with some Marvel-icious stuff like The Hulk and Daredevil coming soon to a theater near you), it's a shame that only now are all these wonderful stories coming out of the ghetto. Heroes with a solid moral code instead of all the Stallone/Schwarzenegger/Willis/Gibson crap that we've been fed the last 20 or so many years. I'm also thankful that studios are getting great directors like Raimi with real respect for the material instead of hacks like Schumacher. In summation, I loved everything and the details made it come alive. To quote my favorite line: Woooohooooooo!!!!
9.0~This is a great movie jacobjohntaylor1 Sign in Permalink This is a great movie. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. It so mush better then V for vendetta. This a great work of art. It is a classic. It is one of the best movies ever.
7.0~A lot of fun. Definitely revival05 Sign in Permalink It's with a mixed feeling of different expectations I sit down in the cinema to watch SPIDER-MAN. I had a hope to see a Great Superheroflick, in the same class as Tim Burton's masterpiece BATMAN (1989). Then I had this more realistic spidersense telling me that "you know, this'll probably be a lot of fun, but really nothing else". Well, my sense was more right than my hopes, but "a lot of fun" is kind of an understatement; It's REALLY a lot of fun watching SPIDER-MAN. First off, there is two things that made me want to see this film; 1. As a kid Spidey was my idol, and Marvel my heaven. This resulted in me knowing state-of-the-art-geek-stuff for the rest of my life. Therefore when time came for "Spidey the movie", my ancient knowledge sparked to life, at least for a while, and for just a couple of hours I was all back to my 11-year-old-mania. 2. My favorite director, Sam Raimi isn't, but I have faith in the man and I trust him to make a fun flick. As a horrorfan his THE EVIL DEAD (1982) remains more or less as a gift. His directing is wild and crazy, unstoppable but therefore also guaranteed to float out of the frames. But I heard Raimi would be a bit more down-to-earth, in SPIDER-MAN. Well that sounded good. Indeed, Raimi doesn't get all that carried away, even though the movie ooze from his fun directing manners. If you've seen DARKMAN (1990) or ARMY OF DARKNESS (1993) you'll see that SPIDER-MAN has the same crazed tempo. Of course BRUCE CAMPBELL does a semi-cameo, Raimi holds up his traditions. Yeah, about the actors, SPIDER-MAN's lineup gives us three stars in the leading roles, Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe and Kirsten Dunst. They are no real favs of mine, but it's a good combination: all three of them are just about as OK actors. Dafoe did his thing, Dunst was cute (as always), I think Maguire stood out making Peter Parker a truly sympathetic character. Of course, to make an a-lot-of-fun-actionadventure these days requires some heavy artilleries from the digital front. True, the digital effects are slick and perfect for the entertainment-meter. When Spidey swings around Manhattan, I can't do nothing else but kick off my shoes (I literary did this) and lean back and just enjoy the ride. 'Cause that is what you gotta do in a movie like this. Forget that it contains two love-declarations, one from Maguire and one from Dunst, that are absolutely ridiculous (and that the dialogues overall are no hotshots). Then you'll have a lot of fun. My rating is 7/10, a bit of a challanger to BATMAN RETURNS (1992) and proving that BATMAN (1989) still is the best. Buy the way. There is a Spider-Man 2 and 3 coming up. Good idea. This movie was very true to the comicbook it was based on, but Spidey lacked his unresistable wits and some of the stuff that are basic to the Spidey-reader are not yet shown off in the movie. Hopefully we'll see more of this in the sequels. Even though I wonder... Sam Neill as DocOc? Bring in Eddie Brock!
10.0~Eye lye kit, eye lye kit eh lawt wipster Sign in Permalink In my youth back in the 60's, I went to the local drugstore every Tuesday right after school to use my allowance to buy all the newest editions of the Marvel comics available (Fantastic Four, Thor, the Hulk, Daredevil, Captain America, etc.) and Spiderman was one of my favorites. I far preferred Marvel comics to DC (Superman, Batman) because they illustrated real people put into extraordinary circumstances, complete with emotion and angst. In my opinion, Sam Raimi captured the essence of what Stan Lee intended in creating these masterpieces... I honestly don't know how it could have been better. Spiderman the movie brought back a lot of memories from my youth, as I used to identify with Peter Parker (the nerd) quite a lot. The casting was perfect, the special effects were great, and the story conveyed exactly what the comic(s) always emphasized: "With great power comes great responsibility." But, in all honesty, I would have like to seen Peter get a chance to boff MJ, at least once... All in all, a masterpiece that raised the significantly raises the bar for movies made from comics. I can't wait for some of the other Marvel comics to be made... it's about time Stan Lee got his due.
8.0~Not too bad. DarkCrimson Sign in Permalink Spiderman the movie was definitely better than I had expected it to be, I am no comic book fan, but I am a movie fan. I think it was about time they brought Spiderman out from the frail pages and onto "The Big Screen." Superman was good, Batman was good (with exception of the ones after the first.), but they all weren't this good. I recommend if you haven't already, to go see this movie. (1-10) I'd give it an 8 which is better that 7, at least.
9.0~Great effects marianagan Sign in Permalink Spiderman the movie is an action packed (focus on plot) hero versus villain (theme) story with a touch of romance. Average boy, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) finds himself with spider-like qualities after being bitten by a genetically altered spider on a field trip to Columbia University. His admiration for his neighbor, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) also known as MJ, has inspired him to use these new found abilities to impress her and others with acts of heroism. This story brings an emotional closeness of family. Peter Parker and Harry Osborn (James Franco) are the best of friends; Peter has lost parents and lives with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris). Harry Lives only with his father, Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe). Don't forget about MJ, she lives with her father next door to Peter's and his family. They have all lost loved ones and are doing the best they can to get by. The conflict of Spiderman and the Green Goblin is very intense; this brings technology in filming to its finest. The lighting used was fabulous, the low-key lighting used when someone was in danger or high-key lighting used when Spiderman had saved the day. The angles used to catch Spiderman and the Goblin was fantastic, as they fly through the air in many different directions. Spiderman casting his webs, swinging from place to place and the Green Goblin riding the glider brings a challenge to produce the film but great entertainment for the viewer. What made this movie stand out from others, even Avatar was great visually, but the sound effects used in Spiderman were exceptional. Sounds to intensify or calm a scene, such as a scene full of conflict had great audio to intensify the scene, sounds of calmness when the conflict is resolved, and sounds of sorrow in times sadness. This made Spiderman, the movie, so impressive. This,hero versus villain, film is absolutely one of the best films of all times, and provides a variety of entertainment for everyone; action, fantasy, and romance. Great characters, great actors helped this movie be a fabulous film to view over and over again. The sequels Spiderman II and Spiderman III are available now, and are anticipated to be just as great or even better. More villain, more romancewho could turn that down? Enjoy the movie.
9.0~How sweet it is! adam8478 Sign in Permalink I've been a Spider-Man fan for a very long time, and fortunately, this movie didn't dissapoint. What I really liked is how this film didn't take itself too seriously, but had some nice dramatic moments sprinkled in there as well. Solid storyline, and some great performances from a number of the actors makes this film well worth seeing.
9.0~Nicely done! ramshot Sign in Permalink I've been a Marvel-fan all my life basically, and I have to say that Spider-Man gave me JUST those vibes that I get when reading the comics, and was the first movie to do so. X-men was an ok movie, but it didn't quite manage to capture the feeling of the original comics. The most disturbing flaw in X-men was the fact that the powers really didn't seem all that "powerful" in the movie as they did in the comics. I mean I could have taken Cyclops on any time with a Luger, you know what I'm saying? Also, these was serious lack of depth in the characters, wherein the comics character development plays a huge part. Now Spider-Man is a totally different story. While all of the effects do not look as good as they could, they certainly do their job well - spider-man is just as fast, agile and flexible as he is in the comics. A friend of mine complained that it didn't look real, but hey, how REAL would a guy who can dodge bullets look in the real world? The story is great. It's basically been told before in the comics tho, but some modifications have been made and things removed to make it better for our viewing pleasure, I guess. However, unlike in many movies based on comics or books, the changes are not too vast. I truly felt like I was watching a movie made out of the comics I've read for years, not something that was loosely "based" on them. This is a good thing, as Spider-Man is not Marvel's most popular character for nothing. Last but not least, Directer Sam Raimi had earned my respect already with the hilarious Evil Dead movies, but now has proven that he is capable of much more than just blood and guts - Spider-Man is simply great quality entertainment. Go see this one people, Marvelist or not. Just don't take it seriously, it's a _fantasy_ story and you should treat it as such. 9/10
10.0~Great Movie borntrini Sign in Permalink I am a big comic book fan and Spiderman, along with the Hulk were my favorites. I like the fact that even though their were a few differences in the character and the story, the movie pretty much stayed on point. The differences actually made the movie that much better (i.e. - shooting web straight from his wrist, as opposed to the "web shooting" gadget he used in the comics). Overall, it is a great movie. Tobey was a perfect fit for the role. I am concerned that he will not likely reprise the role in the second release.
9.0~Best Comic Book Film Yet s10ace37 Sign in Permalink While I do like the film versions of X-Men, and the first of both the Batman and Superman films, I have to say that Spider-Man stands out above all the other comic based movies. I caught a sneak preview of what I believe will be the biggest film of the year, and it delivered. Tons of fast paced explosive action, and the story is timeless, and teaches many an important lesson as well. Tobey McGuire was a perfect choice for Peter Parker/Spider-Man, and now I can't picture anyone else in the role. And while not as memorable as Jack Nicholson's Joker, Willem Defoe is a great Green Goblin (just wait till you hear him laugh...it'll freak you out). Sam Raimi has just made his best picture, which is hard to believe seeing as Evil Dead 2 is genius. This is a great film that many will see over and over again, and it is DEFINETLY going to give Episode 2 a run for its money. 9 out of 10.
9.0~Great fun Mitch-25 Sign in Permalink I am no fan of comic books. I am also not a big fan of Spiderman. However, this movie was just plain fun. The visual effects were stunning, and I really liked Toby as the geeky Peter Parker. Yes, there were slow moments, but they were necessary in order to setup the character. I really liked Defoe as the Green Goblin. He was cool. BTW, there WILL be another Spiderman, you can count on it. There is a HUGE hole at the end of the movie for one.
8.0~As a fan of the comic books, I was delighted with the movie. jknettle Sign in Permalink My parents owned a variety store when I was young, so I grew up reading all the comic books they sold. The Marvel comics were the best - and I followed the adventures of Spider-Man for years. I was doubtful when I heard that Tobey Maguire was going to star in this movie, but he did a great job. The movie, itself, was very faithful to the comic books with the exception of the spider webbing - which was invented by Peter Parker and shot out from little packs at his wrists. I loved the part where Peter first tries out swinging from building to building using the webbing and has a few crashes. Very much like it must have been for the novice web-slinger!
10.0~Breathtaking!!!! mgayoso Sign in Permalink All I have to say is that this movie is Unbelievable. There are no words to describe it. If anyone has not seen it, I don't know what you're waiting for. Tobey Maguire plays the perfect Spider-Man. I can't wait to see it again.
9.0~Exciting, well-put-together story almost cheese-free Jeff M.-3 Sign in Permalink I haven't had any contact with Spider-Man since the newspaper canceled the comic strip in 1993, so I went into this without many if any preconceived notions. The credits at the beginning are a little long, but when it starts into the story it starts right away. The first thing that happens is the trip to the lab. As Spider-Man first develops his senses, he seems to get a handle on them a bit faster than you might expect, leaping from roof to roof the next day. Perhaps it's a little too effortless, but you get the idea that he is trying out his new powers (and it takes him a bit to master the web thing). His costume in the wrestling ring is hilarious, although you later wonder just how it goes from sweatpants to Spandex. The filmmakers tie the wrestling story nicely in with Uncle Ben's death, as the robber Peter lets go past him at the arena kills Ben in a carjacking. After Osborn becomes the Green Goblin, the internal conflicts of personality are portrayed very well. Spider-Man's fight to become a hero is attacked by the editor of the Bugle and others in the city, and the headlines certainly help show that. Peter Parker does a great job of taking pictures of Spider- Man, if you know what I mean. The city scene at the end with Spider-Man swinging between the taxis to the skyscrapers seems like a bit of SFX ego-building, but it also helps show that Spider-Man is here to stay. If you watch fast enough, the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center are still in the background. (Note: A mention of "the bombing" in an earlier scene is NOT a reference to Sept. 11, but to the Green Goblin's first attack on Quest Aerospace.) The character of Peter Parker himself is a wonderful Everyman, full of human emotions, and Tobey Maguire is cast well. Kirsten Dunst is a good MJ, and that first kiss is one to linger over. In a slight twist at the end, MJ is confessing to Peter her feelings, and he sort of brushes her off, because it's part of his curse that those he loves are in danger. But the comic books tell us how that turns out. Willem Dafoe is at his best when holding dialogue with himself, in the Jeckyll/Hyde good/evil scenes 'with' the Green Goblin. It's alternately a movie to sit back and think, and sit back and enjoy the action. With great power comes great responsibility; use your power to enjoy this movie wisely. 8 1/2, maybe 9/10.
5.0~Not a Good Movie ohhaimark-14300 Sign in Permalink I know a lot of people like this movie, but hear me out: this is not a good movie. This is most due to the fact that every second of Tobey Maguire's acting makes me cringe. He gets way too much credit for this movie. I also thought the Green Goblin villain was weak, despite a strong Willem Dafoe performance. The only part of this movie I ended up enjoying was J.K. Simmons' J. Jonah Jameson, who was well-acted and hilarious. This movie, also, every time I see it, can't help feeling campy. I'm sure at the time, this was probably a (small) step up for superhero cinema, but movies like the Dark Knight, which is celebrating its ten year anniversary at the time I'm writing this still have a huge impact all those years later, whereas this just doesn't feel special anymore.
10.0~Awesome Movie Maximus4614 Sign in Permalink I just got back from watching Spider-Man and I have to say that it lived up to my expectations.The Special Effects were just amazing.Tobey Maguire was just the perfect fit for the role of Peter Parker and Spider-Man.William Dafoe was also excellent as the Green Goblin and Norman Osborn.Kirsten Dunst was good as mary jane.The action sequences were just out of this world.I can't wait till they come out with the sequel.
9.0~Geinuinley flawless. A bona-fide masterpiece. ***** out of five prendevi Sign in Permalink Tobey Maguire is a a brilliant actor. Hes so natural.When I heard that Freddie Prinze Jnr was tipped to play Spider-Man. I thought it was a terrible shame. But when I heard Tobey was then tipped I thought ''fantastic''. He is again great here and Sam Raimi -director of the great ''The Evil Dead'' and its even better sequel directs this fantastically.This unlike a lot of recent thrillers builds up the characters brilliantly. This reminds me a lot of The Matrix and it undoubtably the best sci-fi thriller since it.
10.0~Just Plain Genius ! borkar_chin Sign in Permalink This is a story of a very nice-but-not-so-smart scholar, named Peter Parker, Who gets bitten by a genetcally enhanced spider, just to have spider-like super-powers, which he uses to fight a bi-personality villain, the Green Goblin. The story is of-course excellent, but the acting of both Toby & Willem Dafoe is just amazing. I Rate it ***** . A MUST SEEEE !
9.0~Watched the whole film with a stupid grin on my face. tenten76 Sign in Permalink Is it spot on to the comic? No. Is it close enough? Yes. Is the villain scary? No (he looks silly). Is it funny and exciting to watch? Yes. Are Tobey, Kirsten and Willem any good as their characters? Yes, Yes and Yes. Are the stunts and effects excellent? Yes. Does it have a good ending, does it set you up for the sequel? Yes and Yes. Who'd have thought it - a really good superhero movie, that manages to be as entertaining but not as dark as Batman (1 & 2) or as earnest as X-Men. (all of which I also really liked) The (Incredible) Hulk looks really good.. Daredevil (from what little I've seen) looks rubbish.. and Hellboy (from even less information) could easily go either way. But Spider-Man has made it. If you see (or have seen) Spider-Man and don't agree - then it's your own fault for watching a film not aimed at you. Superhero fans (and it's a film about a superhero you miserable nay-sayers, duh!) should not be disappointed.
8.0~Good madheed Sign in Permalink For a film of this type I enjoyed it. I am not a one of thoses comic freaks and am not interested in spiderman, batman or anything of the sort. But with a persistent friend i was dragged along to go and watch it. I was supprised to find that i enjoyed the film and went back to see it another 2 times. There was no boring parts or anything like that. I would suggest for people that think it's not ur sort of film to go and see it u mite get a pleasant supprise!!!!!!
9.0~It rocks! Nahret Sign in Permalink Pardon my language, but it does rock. It rules. It's beyond what I had imagined. After seeing a movie that fulfills almost impossible expectations, a little teenage language can be forgiven, I think. Let's not forget that Spidy is a hero with a cult following, so, naturally, there will always be those who see sacrilege in the few (good! necessary! favourable!) changes the creators of the movie made with respect to the original comic. To those: Come off it! This is a great film; it has the perfect balance of action, drama, laughs and the mandatory romantic element. And, of course, in this kind of event cinema, everything hinges on the right choice of a leading man, and in this aspect, Tobey Maguire is absolutely perfect (am I overusing this word?) as the slightly nerdish Peter Parker. As Auntie May rightly points out, Spiderman is not Superman; Peter's process of discovering and learning to control his powers are among the most hilarious scenes in the film (that spider web thing isn't as easy as it looks). Kirsten Dunst is as lovely as always, and Willem Dafoe would make a good Goblin even without the mask on. Speaking of the villain, not only are we given one whose motivations are understandable, but being who he is, he even opens the door to the sequel. All I can say, if the rest of the movie summer comes on as strong as this film, then we're in for a memorable year indeed. Not to mention the possibility of multiple sequels. 9 out of 10.
8.0~Really looking forward to the sequel taffysmommy Sign in Permalink I enjoyed this more than I thought I would, although it did drag in some spots, but that is understandable for character introduction. Because of that I am really looking forward to the sequel, where we can get into, and stay with the fun stuff.
8.0~Succeeds Like A Spider Can. GeorgeRoots Sign in Permalink Finally, "Spider-Man" makes his debut to the silver screen after all the 1970's Nicholas Hammond TV serials. How well has it been adapted? The casting is debatable even to this day when among my friends. Do you remember when Michael Keaton took heat for Tim Burton's "Batman" (1989)? Well Tobey Maguire is constantly lauded and berated among my peers, but I personally think he did very well and continues to hold up nicely. No doubt I think he gave it his all in "Spider-Man 2" (2004), whereas "Spider-Man 3" (2007) feels no more than a burnout for everyone involved. Though Maguire remains a nice debate for fans, everyone else is casted brilliantly. James Franco and Kirsten Dunst hold their own as great supporting characters. J.K Simmons "IS" J. Jonah Jameson and though William Dafoe is undeniably cheesy in his execution, he steals the show in every scene (That costume however is utter crap, and I highly recommend looking online for the original goblin designs). The action scenes are also very decent, yet the films dated CGI can be a little jarring nowadays. However, scenarios throughout the film kept it engaging as the 10 year old me was blown away at the times release, and it still remains one of my favourite movie going experiences. Though Sam Raimi deviates far from the original storyline, the characters motivations and morals stay true to the original source. It's awesome to see a director incorporate this kind of imaginative camera-work into this movie as he did his older work. Even the final battle arena echoed that of "The Evil Dead" movies. Final Verdict: An American icon brings super heroes into the new millennium with stunning confidence. 8/10.
4.0~Good story, but could hardly have been executed worse CinematicInceptions Sign in Permalink I give this movie a 6.7 out of ten, but I rounded down on the integer rating because it deserves a rating lower than what i gave it. The story is good, and there wasn't very much that I would have changed with that. The character is good as are his various predicaments. Spiderman is a very classy superhero that has some pretty cool abilities. So I give credit to the guy who originally came up with the character and story whose name I haven't bothered to look up. The storyline gets an 8/10. However, the rest of the film gets about a 3 or 4/10. The special effects are less than realistic, and some of that is probably due to the advancement of CGI in '02, but there isn't much of an explanation of making the blood that drops from Spiderman's cut arm look like ketchup when it hits the floor. I'm not that pleased with Toby McGuire's acting either. Peter Parker is often described as mild-mannered, but his constantly star-struck face makes him seem more like an awed three-year old than a quiet high-schooler. The guy getting carried out on a stretcher after fighting the pro-wrestler is hardly convincing in his cries of pain. The other main roles of Aunt May, MJ, and Dr. Osborne/Green Goblin are also not performed with anything spectacular. Even though I'm not really a fan of James Franco, I think he was the only actor with a decent performance in this movie. I feel that the main issue with the movie lies in the fault of the screenwriters. The Green Goblin firing out cliché threats to accompany his missiles makes for more of an annoying than menacing villain. Peter Parker is given so little personality that some of his attitudes contradict each other. Mary Jane is also just sort of there, and not really given a personality. And I'm not really that up on which superheroes are in the DC and Marvel universes, but I do know that Superman and Spiderman are in different fictional universes. So, yes, Aunt May, you are right that your nephew is not Superman because in your world, Superman isn't supposed to exist even in the imagination. Even the film score was very lacking at times. The Green Goblin should not have background like Dracula during the climatic scene. And somebody must think that Mary Jane looked like Tweety Bird while getting chased by the guys who jump her in the street because there is no other explanation for the flute solo in that scene. On the whole, I would not suggest watching this movie to anyone except people that are genuine fans of the character.
8.0~A Great Movie dlantz-58368 Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is a 2002 American superhero film directed by Sam Raimi. it is based on the Marvel comics character of the same name. The film stars Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker. Spider man is about a high school student who develops spider-like super powers. at around the same time as he obtains these powers, his uncle is killed by a common thug. Peter Parker is devastated and leads him to hate all forms of crime. this is what makes him become spider-man. at first, Peter Parker just goes after low level crime. we see him in a montage stopping several crimes and gaining popularity in New York City. this all changes however, when Spider-man meets the green goblin, played by Willem Dafoe. They fight several times in the movie, and their final fight is by far the best. The movie ends with Peter Parker continuing to hide his identity so that he can continue to fight crime. Overall, i would say that this movie is Very good. i don't believe that it's as good as Spider-man 2, but it showed just how great spider-man can work on the big screen. Tobey Maguire as Spider-man was a great choice in my opinion. i really like how he was able to make Peter Parker look weak in the beginning, and make him look strong later in the movie. one thing i didn't like was the relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane. it never really felt real to me. i think the actors did great, but i think they needed better writing. In Conclusion, Spider-man is definitely a movie i recommend.
10.0~Best comic book hero movie yet released Viz79 Sign in Permalink I have to say, I came out after seeing this movie and thinking 'wow'. Its not often that I come out for a movie and think that it was definitely worth seeing but this one was because it managed to capture a comic book character that would have been hard to display on the screen. But to just see him swinging through the city, the special effects managing to capture his agile nature is breath taking. But the story is surprisingly well done managing the portraying the characters to a depth that is unusual for such a movie. At the end, you will have really managed to get a good understanding of Peter Parker, Mary Jane and even the Green Goblin. This first movie has at its core a romance and while I was dismayed at the amount of romantic scenes during the movie, I realised how important they were at the end for introducing the character of Spiderman. The Green Goblin is a superb adversory for Spiderman but I wish there were more actions scenes if anything else although the ones that were displayed were unbelievable visually. But in maintaining a balance between action scenes, character depth and overall movie length, I am happy with what they chose. I am betting that the sequel will be more action packed now that the important character integration is done. I previously enjoyed X-Men but I think it pales in comparison to Spiderman which displays great skill in making you believe the fantasy story and how it could fit into a world like ours. I just can't believe I will have to wait for the sequel, argh! P.S I had always liked Spiderman but after watching this movie and seeing him in full splendor on the silver screen, I am now a *fan* and watching Superman/Batman/X-Men never did that for me. Go Spidey!
6.0~All the subtlety of a sledgehammer... The_Core Sign in Permalink ... but that's OK in a comic book film. Perhaps unfortunately, this has all been done before in the first couple "Batman" films, and the first couple "Superman" films. The entire movie carried a weight of "haven't I seen this scene before?" over and over again. I'm a great fan of the original "Spiderman" series of comic books (which I read avidly as a kid), but I have to agree with Ebert on this one -- the action just looks unrealistic. A physical body cannot move that quickly or smoothly, defying the laws of space, time and gravity. That took a lot of fun out of the action sequences for me. The plot itself is interesting and involving, but *very* rehashed from a number of other superhero-type movies. Nary an original moment in the entire running-time of the film... nothing genuinely creative at all. "Spiderman cereal" will probably leave a sweeter taste in your mouth. My conclusion is that I can't recommend you pay US$7.50 to see this one in the theater, unless you honestly loved the recent "Planet of the Apes" remake and the two "Mummy" films. Wait for the DVD release (rumored to be in November 2002 I think), the film will look just as good (if not better) on the small screen. This movie is NOT a blockbuster... see the 1978 version of "Superman" if you want superhero action, it out-does this film in every conceivable aspect (even the special effects category). 6/10
10.0~Good, Clean, Fun Family Entertainment sspangler01 Sign in Permalink I really liked this movie. It contained all the elements of enjoyable entertainment - action, humor, well acted, no inappropriate language or bedroom scenes. It is about time movies were made that were enjoyable, clean and had a good message for kids. I hope more movies are made like it. I have put Spider-Man in the category of Spy Kids for enjoyable, uplifting family films that help bring families and the community together, instead of tearing them apart.
8.0~Well, this just blows your mind away bullseyez Sign in Permalink There are just a few words I have to say about this movie, which are two. GO SEE THIS MOVIE! This movie's got everything: Action, comedy, romance you name it. So if you wonder which movie you want to see this summer, stop thinking and go see this one. That's what Erlin and I did.
9.0~Seconded. It does indeed "rock"... FilmFan2001 Sign in Permalink ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** First of all, I suppose I ought to say that from the age of about ten until around six years ago when I finally stopped reading the comics, I was a huge Spider-man fan. I suppose, deep down, I still am, though I hated what they ended up doing to the comics (the clones) and that's when I stopped reading. So, it's fair to say that I was extremely excited about this and that my inner twelve-year-old had been waiting his whole life to see it. So. From the perspective of a serious fan, and one with absurdly high expectations, I absolutely loved it. They got everything right - cast, effects, plot, atmosphere. *Everything*. Furthermore, I think the changes they made (organic web-shooters, Green Goblin's costume) were the right decisions to make, since the original Goblin costume would have looked utterly ridiculous and been impossible to get right. More good news - the original theme tune from the 1970s cartoon features on the end credits. It's worth sticking around for - I had a ridiculously silly grin plastered on my face afterwards. Basically, the plot takes perhaps the two most famous Spiderman stories (his origin and The Death of Gwen Stacey) and mixes them together, only with an appropriate time period between them, allowing Peter to both graduate from high school and move to New York. POSSIBLE SPOILERS *Comic geek alert! - Feel free to skip this bit.* (In the original comics, the most famous story involves the Green Goblin discovering Peter's secret identity and then using his gorgeous blonde girlfriend Gwen Stacey to get at him. He throws her off the Brooklyn Bridge, Spiderman catches her with a web-line but the fall breaks her neck anyway. Spiderman is furious with rage and almost kills the Goblin, who is then killed by a trap he has set for Spiderman. In the comics, it's only after Gwen has died that Peter eventually gets together with Mary-Jane. Anyway, the film substitutes Mary-Jane for Gwen for obvious reasons, but there are a lot of similarities otherwise, which will be a real treat if you ever read those comics). DEFINITE SPOILERS As I said, the best thing about this is that they get everything right. All the familiar characters are there, including Flash Thompson and Harry Osborn (James Franco from Freaks & Geeks!). There are also appearances from un-named characters such as Betty Brant and Robbie Robertson - more treats for fans, I suspect. There's even a name-check for 'Dr. Connors' (aka The Lizard), who'd be a good bet for one of the sequels, as Spiderman's best foes always have some sort of close connection to him. The set-pieces are terrific. They include: Peter discovering his Spidey-powers (no 'wakes up having 'webbed' himself scene, sadly); beating up Flash Thompson ( Yeah! ); the wrestling match ("The Human Spider!"); chasing the thief; the first attack by the Goblin; the frankly jaw-dropping bridge sequence and the -as promised- extremely violent fight at the end. (It's very very violent for a 12 - yet another example of them not copping out). Raimi was the perfect choice for this - it's comic-book-ish but in the way it should be. It never takes itself too seriously, but it never dumbs it down or winks at the audience either. And, it has to be said, the effects that count (web-shooting, web-swinging, wall-crawling) are amazing. Okay, so some of the CGI Goblin stuff is a bit disappointing and some of the 'jumping' scenes are over-CGI'd (if that's a phrase) but overall it works beautifully. Raimi also pulls off some excellent 'shock-moments' that work really well. The cast are terrific. Maguire is perfect, as is Dunst. And that rain scene...wow. When it started raining, the men in the audience all suddenly sat up to pay close attention. Let's just say, this movie will be HUGE on DVD... Minor criticisms? Well, for one, J.Jonah Jameson isn't in it enough. He's fabulous in the scenes he's in, but then pretty much disappears. Hopefully they'll do the Scorpion in the future and then he'll have a bigger part. Secondly, as much as I loved Danny Elfman's score, it wasn't memorable in the way that his Batman score was - I'd forgotten it before I even got out of the cinema. Thirdly, it's not quite as funny as it should be (particularly in terms of Spiderman's trademark wise-cracks), though there's lots of humour in the first half. Having said that, though, given the tone of the second half, it was probably the right decision. Anyway, these are really minor criticisms, given the film overall. One more thing. The ending doesn't cop out and is decidedly unexpected, but definitely the right decision. Congratulations to whoever fought (and won) that particular battle. (Incidentally, see it in the best sound-equipped cinema possible - the sound in one scene in particular was amazing). SPOILERS END So, in short, the effects are spectacular , the cast is amazing , it's extremely dark in tone and it doesn't cop out at the end. I'm unashamedly putting this straight into my Top Ten of the Year. Having said all that, I feel duty-bound to confess that not that many other people seemed to like it - I heard a lot of disappointed opinions on the way out of the cinema. So...it definitely won't be for everyone. But I bloody loved it. So there.
9.0~Surprisingly enjoyable psycholemming Sign in Permalink This film was definite entertainment from start to finish. Although I could smell the stink of James Cameron in the dialogue (don't get me wrong, I love the guy's directing, but anyone who allows him to write dialogue should be beaten with a stick), it never failed to amuse and entertain me -- something movies haven't been doing lately. I hope Stan Lee and the legions of Spidey fans feel proud of this one; it's a keeper.
8.0~Finally, my favorite comic is brought to life! muchneededescape Sign in Permalink Spider-Man comic's were the greatest. They out did every other comic in Marvel and DC. The movie had great casting. Maguire fit the personality and build of Peter Parker almost too well. No ther actor could ever play Spidey that good. One thing you must admit was the movie was very faithful tot he comic books and the little additions here and there were a nice taste as well. Simmons fit Jameson well and Dafoe was splendid as Green Goblin/Norman Osbourne. I was surprised that the computer effects looked so real because in all the movie trailers I thought that the graphics would be much lower quality. However, they seemed to fit right into the battle scenes. Good acting, good graphics, good movie.
8.0~"With great power comes great responsibility" jimbo-53-186511 Sign in Permalink A nerdy high-school student Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) gets bitten by a genetically modified spider and wakes up the next morning with a completely new lease of life; he has perfect vision, is stronger and faster than he was before and can also swing through New York City due to his ability of firing webs from his wrist. However, Spider-man isn't the only person in New York with superpowers and he finds himself fighting against the Green Goblin (the alter ego of brilliant scientist Norman Osborn - Willem Dafoe) who will stop at nothing to destroy both Spiderman and everyone around him that he cares about. Perhaps it is the sweet nature of this origin story that makes it such a winner; we have Peter Parker who is perhaps one of the most unassuming comic book anti-heroes to grace the screen. As Parker, he has a nerdy-goofy charm about him that endears us towards him and as Spider-man he is cool and a great action hero. In the same vein as The Fantastic Four, Peter Parker struggles getting to grips with his super powers and it takes a bit of time for him to adjust to what he has become. This transition is fun to watch and the scene where he kicks that bully's ass was brilliant. The real story here kicks in when Spider-man isn't paid properly for defeating a fearsome wrestler; he is only paid $100 dollars rather than $3,000 dollars. I won't say anymore than that, but this incident sets off a chain reaction which makes Spider-man the beloved anti-hero. The only minor negative with this story set-up is that you do feel that he becomes who he is out of a sense of guilt more than a sense of duty, but this is minor and is something that I was prepared to overlook in this film. I normally hate love stories in film, but the blossoming love between Parker and Mary Jane Watson was quite endearing; Watson is a little misguided and can't really see what is right under her nose, but she is never unlikeable and the blossoming relationship between Watson and Parker did feel quite natural. There are some minor flaws with this film such as there being no investigation into the death of Osborn's colleague after he performs the experiment on himself; they say he was murdered and that someone stole Osborn's prototype, but then that thread is conveniently dropped - we learn the truth later, but it still makes no sense that no-one would follow-up this crime with an investigation. It's also terribly convenient that Spider-man happens to be around to save the day with every crime committed in New York (which is incredible), but again I can suspend disbelief for these things due to how involved I was in the main story. The acting is also of the highest calibre; Maguire is very good as both the nerdy-geek and as everyone favourite anti-hero. Dunst is good as the female heroine; she has a nice naïve charm about her, but is also good at playing the damsel-in-distress. The likes of Dafoe and Simmons both have fun chewing the scenery, but the latter comes off as the best putting in a brief, but memorable performance. Franco is perhaps the only weak link in the film, but that's mainly because he is given so little to do. Spider-man is one of the best superhero films out there and contains a great origin story, a believable romance, an impressive villain and good anti-hero. Despite its two hour running time, it moves at a lightning fast-pace, is never dull and boasts some pretty good special effects. Brilliant stuff
6.0~The Green Goblin's silly costume hurts an otherwise very good film taikman Sign in Permalink Spiderman has all the ingredients of the best comic-book superhero movies: a likeable leading man, a beautiful love interest, strong sexual tension, a villain played by a top-notch actor, cool special effects. What lets it down is an odd thing for such a big-budget movie: a silly costume. The movie is strongest in its opening half, when the characters are being introduced and Peter is learning his new powers. One of the best scenes in the movies is when Peter stares in delight at the new muscles he's grown overnight and flexes them in the mirror. Every skinny man's dream. Tobey Maguire is an excellent Spiderman: he has a wide-eyed sense of wonder and innocence about him that helps us feel both his pleasures and pains. There is also genuine chemistry between him and Kirstin Dunst, something which feels all the more real after the horrible attempt at romance in 'Attack of the Clones'. There are some corny lines and sometimes when Spiderman is web-slinging his way across New York it does feel like you're watching someone else playing Playstation, but overall director Sam Raimi has done a fine job. But back to that costume. It's not Spiderman's that is the problem, indeed reliable sources tell me that Maguire looks quite sexy in his skin-tight suit.Rather it is the Green Goblin, who looks like a cross between a carnival clown and a cheesy, plastic-armoured 'Star Trek' extra. Willem Dafoe is convincing as both loving father and vicious killer, but as soon as he puts on his mask he becomes just another raving maniac in a ridiculous outfit. Because of this it is hard to get involved in the fights between the hero and the villain, the centrepiece of any superhero movie, which is why I would rank this below such films as 'X-Men', 'Superman' and Tim Burton's brilliant 'Batman' movies. That aside, Spiderman is a good film, and its huge success in the States will produce several sequels. I look forward to seeing Maguire and Dunst in them. 6 1/2 / 10
10.0~Go Spidey!!! shopkins-1 Sign in Permalink I loved this movie, it is the first comic book based movie since the original Batman that lives up to it's hype. I thought Toby Maguire did an outstanding job of portraying Peter Parker. Spiderman Rules!!!!
9.0~Greatest Comic Book Adaptation since Superman: The Movie KMM Sign in Permalink It has been a long time since I went to the movies to watch a comic book adaptation and come away so completely and utterly satisfied. I drove 65 miles to an AMC Theatre in Overland Park because the theaters in Topeka are relics that should be condemned. It was worth the trip out there!! Sam Raimi hit a bull's-eye with Spiderman sticking closely to the comic book's central theme. He also succeeds in having a good balance between the drama and the humor in the film as well as presenting a lot of storyline detail in a movie that is just over 2 hours long. I have quickly become a huge fan of his over the last few years, and after seeing Spiderman, I enjoy his work even more than before. There are some minor problems and changes with Spiderman compared to the comic book, but they are just that...minor. Tobey Maguire made a believer out of me as Peter Parker. I was quite skeptical when I first heard the announcement he was going to play this role. He turned out to be a great pick proving me wrong. I felt he did a good job carrying out the transformation his character goes through from high school nerd to an individual presented with great gifts who, through various trials and tribulations, quickly learns that with great power comes great responsibility. Willem Dafoe pulled off Norman Osborne beyond my expectations playing him and his evil alter ego, The Green Goblin, with diabolical delight. I liked the fact that the director allowed the movie to be dark in tone when it needed to be and also to be violent in its portrayal of The Green Goblin as he wreaks havoc and carnage towards his enemies and in the finale as he meets his demise. The movie doesn't necessarily have an upbeat ending, but rather nicely sets up for the upcoming sequel. It showed the viewer that the abilities Peter Parker now possesses are not just a gift, but are also a curse because of occurrences that took place due partly in fact to his being Spiderman. For example, the events that took place with Mary Jane and his Aunt Mae. When his enemy learned who the man behind the mask really was, those closest to him were tormented. There is also great tragedy in the fact that Peter Parker is between a rock and a hard place as his alter ego, Spiderman, when it comes to his best friend Harry Osborne. As the movie winds down, Harry has animosity and bitterness toward Spiderman because he thinks he murdered his father, but at the same time considers Peter Parker the only real family he has left. It was also very cool to see Bruce Campbell have a cameo as the ring announcer during the wrestling scene. Although brief, it is a memorable scene for Bruce Campbell fans. I will definitely see this one again. Just a wonderful 2 hours of movie making that gives me hope knowing there are still moviemakers out there that know how to bring superhero flicks to the big screen with major success. This movie was meant to do nothing more than entertain its audience and it goes above and beyond that. Go and watch Spiderman today!!! 9/10
10.0~Best comic book movie ever!One of the best of any movies ever! lt20 Sign in Permalink I saw this movie the second day it was in theaters and right away it was one of my favorite movies ever(if not my favorite. Tobey Mcguire was a great Peter Parker. He was A much better pick then a flavor of the month actor. Kirsten Dunst was great. She isn't only one of the most beautiful women ever, but she is a great actress.Willem Defoe is the perfect Green Goblin. He was really creepy in some parts of the movie. The origin story was done perfectly. I also like the bridge seen at the end. It reminded me of the famous issue of the comic which basicly had the same situation. Sam Raimi did this movie the way it was meant to be. I can't wait for the sequal.
7.0~A Classic movie NicolasWong Sign in Permalink I just watched it yesterday. I was really amazing for the human acting of the cartoon's SPIDER MAN. I've seen someof the SPIDER MAN's cartoons a few years ago. All came from the TV. The whole story was quite interesting. In the whole movie. I think it caught my eyes in every moment. Pretty girl--Kristin Dunst and a good looking guy--Tobey Maguire. Tobey Maguire seemed to be a kind of genius. Moreover, his acting was quite good when I discovered his talking with Kristin besides her aunt's patient bed. He just showed how much he loved her. And the most interesting point was that the spider man was a elastic man. He could fly freely.. even stronger than the comics. WORTH TO SEE IT! 9.5/10
10.0~One of the best movies of the year!!! Smells_Like_Cheese Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is seriously the best movie of the summer! I couldn't believe how much fun I had watching this movie: the fights, the costumes, the characters I'm not even a comic book nerd, no offense to those who are, just I couldn't believe how much of a nerd I felt like when I was jumping and getting excited to see this movie. I waited an hour in line to see this movie with my friends and I have to tell you that it was completely worth it. This is the crazy movie of the summer, but it's one of the best blockbusters to come out of the new millennium. I was never into Spider-Man, didn't really know about the story, but seeing this movie, I think I'm going to take a trip to the comic book store probably. Peter Parker, his best friend Harry Osborn, and Peter's secret crush Mary Jane Watson visit a genetics laboratory with their high school class. While taking photos in the laboratory, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically engineered "super spider". Feeling unwell, he passes out shortly after arriving home. Meanwhile, scientist and owner of Oscorp Norman Osborn, Harry's father, is attempting to preserve his company's military contract, knowing that its loss will mean the end of his business. He experiments on himself with his company's new, but unstable, performance-enhancing chemical vapor which increases his speed, strength, and stamina. However, it also causes him to become insane and kills his assistant. The next morning, Peter wakes to find that his previously impaired vision has improved and that his body has changed into a more muscular physique. At school, he finds himself producing webbing and having the quick reflexes to avoid being injured in a fight with bully Flash Thompson. Peter escapes from the school and realizes that he has acquired spider-like abilities from the spider bite. He quickly learns to scale walls, long jump across building rooftops and swing via webs from his wrists. Norman being ticked off that he didn't get a muscular body he decides to destroy the world! OK, that's not exactly the reason, but I did sense tension there. I had so much fun watching this movie, I can't tell you how many incredible scenes there were, I think my favorite was between Norman coming to Thanksgiving dinner and the high tension when he finds out who Spider Man is and the last fight scene between Spider Man and the Green Goblin was awesome! The ending is a cliff hanger, so I'm looking forward to seeing the next Spider Man. This was a great movie, I highly recommend it, Spider-Man has great effects, cheesy acting, fun one liners, and the upside down kiss that will be talked about for generations to come. 10/10
9.0~Danny Elfamn, the Greatest compositor in the world. truenks4 Sign in Permalink I admire Danny Elfman,he is a great compositor.When i had 'Danny Elfman compose the score of Spider-Man',i had no bad things against him.The score is of the most best, more than Superman score by Jhon Williams.Danny did a god jab on the music.By now, i still admire his score,the music is something god on a movie.I don't think there's someone ho can ''crash'' Elfman score.I recommended this score to everyone who like the music.Spider-Man can't be completed with a great music like this one, so, they call Danny Elfman to it.I still hope this: Danny will be back, one day,to compose once again a Spider-Man score.¿You are with me?
10.0~AWESOME AS HACK! todd2u Sign in Permalink I love this movie. Comic book based movies has really done good in the past. From Superman to Batman to X-Men to Blade 1 and 2. Spider-man is well passed movie. When I write a review I not trying to be professional about it. i just want to give my opinion on he movie. I'm a movie watcher. I love big special effect filled movies with lots of action. Spider-man had good music in it. From beginning to end I loved it. Like I hope this becomes as big as X-Men or Superman. The acting and casting was good. The actors were believable. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good comic bood based or just likes a good movie.
9.0~As Good As It Gets clandestine Sign in Permalink Adaptations are tough; an adaptation of something as uniquely magical as a comic book is tougher. Ask the legion of directors and writers who have tried it over the past quarter century. But Raimi, Koepp, and company have come about as close as is humanly possible, and with one of the most difficult and nuanced characters ever to grace a comic book panel: Spider-Man. The resulting film captures the essence of the whole Marvel Universe, moreso even than "X-Men" (which was a solid, enjoyable movie). Given 30+ years of storytelling, it's rare when screenwriters actually mine the vein for classic storylines, but Koepp expertly weaves several classic threads into the plot. Spider-Man always sported an ensemble cast and it's nice to see it preserved in the film: Aunt May and Ben Parker, MJ, Flash, Harry, and, best of all, a superb J. Jonah Jameson! A delicate balance between flashy action scenes and quiet moments, Raimi really succeeds in keeping a comic book feel in a modern big-budget film. The good: the casting is wonderful. Dafoe really sells it as Osborne as does Franco as his son (you can tell they studied the books). J.K. Simmons nails JJJ in some of the best scenes in the film. The costuming and effects are well done. Some people have been bothered by the CGI (although many of the action scenes really are Maguire), but some restraint was actually used. It's not as though the effects dominate the picture. The action perfectly captures Spider-Man...his movement, his ballet-like agility, and a bit of the humor as well. And this movie does have humor, though perhaps not as much as the comic. The bad: well, nothing bad, but yes, some of the dialogue is a little over-the-top, most likely by design. It IS based on a comic book, after all. And the usual plot holes and continuity errors. But in light of the accomplishment, bringing the heart along with the flash, it's a great film and a rollicking good time, too.
8.0~Good job, Sam Raimi! joshuadrake-39480 Sign in Permalink SPIDER-MAN is one of my favorite Comic Book films of all time and this is my review of the 2002 original. The film follows Peter Parker, an orphaned high schooler who pines after popular girl next door Mary Jane Watson. While on a science class field trip, Peter is bitten by a genetically- engineered "super spider". As a result, Peter gains superhuman abilities, increased strength, speed and the abilities to scale walls and generate organic webbing. After his beloved Uncle Ben is murdered, a murder Peter could have easily prevented, the teenager realizes that he must use his newfound abilities to protect New York City and he becomes Spider-Man. Meanwhile, wealthy industrialist Norman Osborn, the father of Peter's best friend Harry Osborn, subjects himself to an experimental performance-enhancing serum, which creates a psychotic and murderous split personality. Donning a military battlesuit, Norman becomes the freakish "Green Goblin", who begins to terrorize the city. Peter, as Spider-Man, now must do battle with the Goblin, all while trying to express his true feelings for Mary Jane. The feel of the comic book look and the film should be praised. Director Sam Raimi and his team really did a great job of bringing the Spider-Man character to life on the big screen was really amazing, and with today's CGI effects, they were about to make him jump and climb up walls. From the skyscrapers of New York to the warehouses to the film's web slinging sequences to the action sequences, this movie makes you feel like you wish you had the same powers as Spider-Man and the film has a great cast, who bring true performances to the characters they are playing. Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker and Spider-Man and who does an amazing job in the part and his performance won me over in this film and he would play the part for the next two films. When he is Peter Parker, he takes a serious approach, but once he is Spider-Man, man, he is super cool. The way that had his costume in this film was just wonderful, but the one thing that was missing was his web-shooters, but that was in the reboot. Willem Dafoe plays Norman Osborn and Green Goblin and he gives us a menacing, hilarious and serious villain who loves being evil and I will say, the costume is a bit stupid, but I like it though. It's not horrible, but it could have been worse, worse than George Clooney's Batman suit in Batman and Robin and that is for sure! The rest of the cast is just amazing. James Franco plays Harry Osborn and he does an amazing job. Rosemary Harris is sweet and was the perfect casting choice and he is just amazing and fantastic, as the grandmother and aunt of Peter Parker, Aunt May Parker and she does wonders. The late Cliff Robertson plays Uncle Ben and that was the best performance of his career. It was really amazing and fantastic to see him in that role, who would later be played by Martin Sheen, in the 2012 reboot. At last, but least, Kirsten Dunst plays the role of Mary Jane Watson and she gives an amazing performance in this film and her and Dunst won 2003 MTV Movie Award for Best Kiss and that kiss with them is one of my favorite moments in movies. The music by Danny Elfman is just amazing and fantastic. The theme is really amazing as hell and it is fantastic and so amazing. It was a really good musical score and I love his BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS musical scores and that was really fantastic. The visuals are amazing and the action sequences that I like the most are the fights between Spider-Man and Green Goblin and the fight choreography in those scenes were really well done and the dialogue in this movie is really wonderful and this script was written by David Koepp and he wrote a good script and this film is really amazing. Overall, SPIDER-MAN is a really amazing film and it is really fantastic and an amazing, spectacular, incredible, stunning and well done superhero film that does not get enough credit and it really gets a lot of things right and this was really fantastic and it is really amazing to see Spider-Man on the big screen. I could go for hours talking about how much I like this and talk about the action sequences, the dialogue, the effects, music, editing and the acting from the actors, but I know that IMDb has a word limit and I've got to keep this review short. Spider-Man is a really good and amazing comic book film and this will remain as one of my best superhero films of all time and one of my best superhero films on IMDb and it will not change. I'm giving this film a rating of an 8 out of 10.
10.0~Better than I expected! tcano Sign in Permalink I was very impressed with how the movie was done- I was a little apprehensive about the casting, but everyone did a brilliant job. This is what a summer action movie SHOULD be, and I know my husband- a hard-core Spiderman fan- was very pleased with how Raimi translated his hero to the big screen. Great entertainment, whether you're a long-time fan of the comic or just a casual watcher. This will be in our DVD collection the day it's released, and I'm sure we'll go back to see it again soon.
9.0~Best Comic Book to Big Screen Movie Ever! kevcav Sign in Permalink Spiderman has made a crossover that puts Batman and Superman to shame. No other Comic book Hero has ever made a big screen appearance as Spiderman. This movie is for every generation to watch, young and old. You wont be disappointed.
9.0~Awesome!! mrmunkoms Sign in Permalink I had the distinct pleasure of seeing this movie opening day. When I left the theater I was in awe at how great that movie was. I was also happy to see that Sam Raimi stuck to the original cartoon plot and everything. The special effects were kind of like a video game and cartoon, but that is the point. It started out as a cartoon why not stick with it. If your going to see a movie this summer. I suggest you see this or Episode 2.
10.0~Exactly what you'd expect if a great comic book came to life podo Sign in Permalink I grew up reading Marvel and DC super hero comics, and Spiderman was one of my favorites. This movie is a superb and faithful live rendition of the comic book (with the exception of the absence of the mechanical web gizmos on the wrists). The action is tremendous, character development unexpectedly complete, and the special effects are UNBELIEVABLE. You will believe a man can really swing on webs and ride a rocket powered glider. I can't wait to see it again on the bog screen, and I rarely go see the same movie twice in theaters.
1.0~Special Effects are horrible!!!!! ucgrad Sign in Permalink Ok, so what happened here?!?! They had a HUGE budget yet completely botched the special effects! What the heck? And the Green Goblin was terrible...the makeup was so ridiculous that I wanted to burst out laughing. I cannot believe this movie has made so much money. Dont waste your time. If you want to see a movie deserving of $400M box-office go see LORD OF THE RINGS!!!!!!!!!!!
9.0~Simply the best!! mljohns Sign in Permalink Words can't describe the elation felt from viewing this movie. For a long suffering Spider-Man fan like me, seeing Spidey done right on the big screen is like a dream come true. Sure, the non-mechanical web-shooters bothered me a little, but I can forgive Raimi for doing that because he stayed faithful to the soul of the comics and the characters. The character development and interactions of this movie should be a model for many films to come, both comic book related and non-comic book related. The casting of Tobey Maguire as Peter/Spidey....PURE GENIUS, can't think of another actor that could capture the essence of those characters the way he did. This was, hands down, the best comic adaptation I've seen. Can't wait for the DVD!!!! My rating...**** (out of ****)
7.0~You think you know the story... Asentiff2004 Sign in Permalink Peter Parker, an intelligent but awkward teenager's life is forever changed after he is bitten by a genetically altered spider, giving him spider like super powers. Peter learns that with great power comes great responsibility as he must fight evil as a superhero after tragedy strikes within his family. Based on the MARVEL comic, many people consider this a fantastic film, and why i do agree up to a point, certain aspects of the film fall short with me. The action is superb but much is left to be desired with some of the over the top hokey dialog and cheesiness throughout the film. Now granted there is a good bit of this film that is extremely enjoyable, the pacing of the film is well and most of the acting is decent, personally i believe Tobey Maguire is a perfect Peter Parker but a let down as Spider-Man. Let be known that as a child I grew up reading Spider-Man as he was my favorite MARVEL comic book other than Captain America, so the character holds special relevance to me. Now I'am not saying this is a bad film, not at all, but certain aspects of the film left me flat and I felt as though much more could be perfected and achieved through this film. Now granted compared to its eventual sequels this is by the far best of Raimi's Spider-man trilogy, but not the best comic book film. Enjoyable action sequences, a true to form story and with a decent pacing within the film. The biggest drawbacks are in its acting and in its dialog throughout. Spider-Man is an enjoyable film, just not the best.
9.0~good comic book adaptation with great visual effects and action benmet420 Sign in Permalink i really enjoyed spider man. it kept me busy, it was one thing after another. i have been a fan of sam rami's work since the evil dead movies and you can tell that his work is there. the only thing i did not like was there seemed to be some holes in the story. don't get me wrong, the movie was great and full of action, but some things just were not answered in the stroy. some things seemed to happen to fast and not as gradual as i am used to. well overall spider man is great movie, with lots of acton and GREAT effects.
10.0~A film that you will want to see again and again!!! tekman228 Sign in Permalink This movie was great, even if you haven't even read the comics like me. The CGI effects were unbelievable, and the fight scenes were awesome. The music, composed by Danny Elfman, is very unique and beautiful and blends perfectly with the movie. The only down side to the movie are the scenes where Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst talk to each other with nothing else going on for what seems like a long time. Otherwise, Spider-Man was brilliant, and I recommend seeing it again and again until Spider-Man 2 comes out on May 7, 2004.
8.0~The bar for comic book adaptations is officially raised! katdady Sign in Permalink Much praise goes to Tobey Maguire. I figured he would play a good Peter Parker, but not a good Spidey, well he proved me and I'm sure many others wrong. Kudos to Maguire and director Sam Rami for bringing my favorite superhero to the big screen. Just as we all think of Christopher Reeves anytime we think of Superman, Tobey will be the name that pops into heads when Spider-Man comes up. I have to admit that my opinion is very biased since i am a huge Spider-Man fan, but when you consider how hard it is to please die hard fans when comics are made into movies, the fact that I was delighted with this film should speak volumes. I appreciate the liberties that were taken with the original Spider-Man story, but love the how the director was able to keep the story so very accurate to the original. I can't wait until Spider-Man 2!
10.0~Hands down the best comic book hero made into a movie of all time. whit9757 Sign in Permalink Spiderman pulls you in and keeps you there and if you don't believe me you can ask my wife who is insisting we go see it again. I was unable to put my finger on what it is about this movie that makes it so much better than other comic book movies to hit the big screen. I guess it comes down to the characters believability. Peter Parker as a young kid about to graduate highschool gets bitten by the genetically created spider that makes him spiderman. We get to see what any real teenager would do when he finds out he's just turned into a superhuman spidey. We get to see him fumble, play with his powers, design his suit, and all the while keeping you in your seat wanting more. Unlike movies such as Batman and Superman that started off slow and stayed slow until the end, Spiderman has a little for everyone. As a huge Star Wars fan, I'm fairly sure that Spiderman will be the movie most talked about this summer. Kirsten Dunst was also a surprise. I'm not a big fan of hers and yet she was fairly believable. One of the things that originally turned me off of her in this movie was the "Wet T-shirt" scene in the trailer and indeed there are some cleavage shots, but they in no way take away from the movie. In fact considering her characters background her dress was appropriate if not expected. Toby *IS* Spiderman, after seeing him in this film, there is no one else who can ever play Spidey again. Go see this movie, you won't regret it.
10.0~Spider- man meets a girl of his dreams until a nightmare comes crashing down on him! howellgirl2011 Sign in Permalink I loved the story concept. A nerd bitten by a spider then turns into a superhero and battles his greatest enemy the Green Goblin. I loved every bit of this film, like the spider-man costume, the green goblin costume, the fight for superhero world and your love world, all in one whole movie! The fight scenes were amazing and really impressive to millions of viewers that have seen this film. My greatest scene was when the Green Goblin tried to persuade Spider-man to join him or die with the city.I was really afraid that Spidey would join forces with the Goblin at first thought. If he did do that it would be hell in that city, believe me it would. I really loved the idea that the Goblin tried to destroy everything that Spidey had in his life family, a girl-friend, friends, and his responsibilities to his city and neighborhood surroundings.
10.0~Oh yeah ! zoran_kamen Sign in Permalink I truly don't know what to say about this movie, which got already all possible praises and all possible critics ! But I will write what I can from my heart, cause my post cannot match any reviews from grammatical super humans and ultra intelligent movie critics ! OK lets start : This movie is directed by one of my favorite film directors Sam Raimi who directed and produced so many good movies and one I love the most is TV series adaptation of Evil Dead (also directed by him) movie, Ash vs Evil Dead which also have mostly positive reviews by top critics. I think ratings go well over 90% on rotten tomatoes ! Spider-Man is supremely made from beginning till end. Every scene is so fresh, playful, innocent and there is no second of boredom in this one ! I think its the best movie of all movies about Spider- Man and they surely knew why Sam Raimi would be perfect man for directing it ! Special effects are just right amount and they don't look artificial at all ! You really have feeling like being part of this world of super heroes and super villains ! So if you wanna movie to look good give it to Spielberg, Peter Jackson or Sam Raimi ! In all three cases you cannot miss ! Acting could be flawed but movie will look good ! Cause I really love movies about super heroes, with Superman first part being one of my favorite movies ever, but I love also Batman and actually all marvel produced world of super heroes, including X-men franchise (Nine movies until 2016, Deadpool is really great, as well as all others, yup I like also those three banned by critics) Why I wrote this review in 2016 if movie was made 2002 ? I always loved this movie,I guess I would like to support its ratings to go for tiny bit higher ! So for me everything is perfect in this movie - acting, effects, story, scenery for me all this is 10/10 ! On of rare movies I can say that without least doubt ! Just one more thing- 3rd part of Spider Man from 2007(also directed by Sam Raimi) was little bit over criticized by movie critics ! I know they know what to write, they are not stupid of course, but still maybe we became little to spoiled by both mega successful and genius parts before that one (2002 and 2004) cause they said ; in this 3rd part problem is there is too much of everything, but I think Sam Raimi just wanted to conclude franchise with spectacular finish, so in my eyes it was unjustly rated and my rate for all three parts is 10/10 without any doubt ! Thank You Sam for so many excellent movies and to make our life more fun !!
1.0~This movie is rubbish!!! peacepit Sign in Permalink Don't waste your money going to see this piece of rubbish. Once again hollywood has hyped up a movie that is a load of trash. The acting was terrible!!! Toby McGuire can't act to save himself, I was more sorry for myself sitting there having to watch his bad acting than anything he was trying to portray on the screen. The worst bit of the movie was every scene the green goblin was in!!! Action man at K-mart looks better than that green, plastic looking idiot. The effects were ok, but nothing to great to talk about and not on screen long enough to be interesting. The only good thing in the movie is Kirsten Dunst, at least she can act and saved the movie from reaching the all time low score of ZERO. My one point vote goes entirely to her. This movie must have been aimed at a 5 year olds audience, but mentally all you needed to watch this piece of haggis (cooked sheep intestines for those who don't know what haggis is) is rocks in your head. But wait theres more, hollywood will marvel at this piece of gut rot and probably give it the oscar for "movie of the year" anything can happen, a beautiful mind won over lord of the rings so spiderman must be up for best movie 2002, I know I won't bother to watch the academy awards if this movie gets even one nomination!!!
1.0~Enjoyable movie for everyone Aeris4ever Sign in Permalink First off, I want to say I'm a huge Star Wars fan and thought AOTC kicked butt. That seems irrelevant, but with the "war" between Spider-man and Star Wars fans, it needed to be said. Especially since I've never been a Spider-man fan or a fan of any other comic book hero. The whole thing is new to me. But I saw "Spider-man" and thought it was excellent. It's not without flaws, but what movie isn't? The CG effects worked out well and weren't overused. Some of them looked super cheesy in the previews, but you hardly notice them in the movie. I'll never understand why so many people are against CG effects, especially with this movie and Attack of the Clones. Sorry, but stringing up a 2-inch Spider-man model with a piece of dental floss isn't gonna cut it anymore. I'm amazed at what can be done in movies today and CG is the only way to achieve certain things. The characters were excellent, especially Tobey. I had doubts about him playing such a physical character, but he really fit the role. Kirsten did well with what she was given, but her character was the type who couldn't have saved herself from drowning in a puddle. But this is comic book material and unfortunately, the women must be totally helpless. Her character was the only one I didn't like. Peter's aunt and uncle were very likeable, though. The story itself was very cool. Not knowing a thing about Spider-man, it was great that I was able to understand the entire movie. This is where it outshines Star Wars. Anyone can watch "Spider-man" and fall in love with it, whereas first-time Star Wars viewers will get almost nothing out of AOTC. My only personal complaint of "Spider-man" is that it has no repeat value, at least for me. I saw it, liked it a lot, and that's it. I've seen it once and that's all I need. But fans will likely see it again and again with good reason.
10.0~They did it right! dominatr37 Sign in Permalink This was undoubtedly the best comic adaption ever made. Far, far better then the campy junk like Batman and even Superman. Everything was there, all the right elements. Sure, they deviated from the origin story slightly, and the webs coming out of his wrists instead of mechanical webshooters annoyed me a little. But that's about it. I thought the story was great, the action , basically amazing. and the scenes of him swinging through the metallic and stone canyons of NY was simply spectacular. The best super-hero flick ever !!! I've seen it 3 times already. And I've exited the theatre every time with a huge grin on my face.
9.0~Insert Cliched Praise Here happytown79 Sign in Permalink I saw Spider-Man before it was released, and I am only now writing a review of it, so I don't know what I can add that hasn't already been said, so I'll be brief. Tobey Maguire was the perfect choice for Spider-Man (duh), Kirsten Dunst is easily the best looking, and possibly the most talented (although Ms. Portman and Ms. Ricci may have something to say about that) actress under the age of 25 working now. Sam Raimi has always been an underrated director (overshadowed by the likes of Tarantino), but he finally gets a big hit to put him more into the public spotlight. I noticed some similarities between "Spider-Man" and Raimi's other "superhero" film, "Darkman". While "Darkman" at times looks like it was directed by a mental patient (which is an oh-so-good thing), "Spider-Man" has a more honed look, although it is clearly a Raimi film (most notably in the climactic fight between Spidey and the Green Goblin). J.K. Simmons steals every scene that he is in as the newspaper editor, and if he is not in the sequel it's a bigger loss to the cast than anyone but Maguire and Dunst. Randy Savage is laugh out loud funny as wrestling champion Bonesaw McGraw, as well as a quote machine ("I got you for threeeeeeeee minutes!!!"). There are just so many wonderful elements to this film, both large and small, that I don't know what to talk about here (and I know I will be kicking myself in 5 minutes for leaving something out of my review). So, fantastic movie, see it if you haven't yet for some reason, and see it again if you've only seen it once, 9 out of 10.
3.0~the comics were good but the movie isn't alucifer Sign in Permalink when i was younger i was a huge spiderman fanatic.i used to have lots of the spiderman comics.but after sitting down and watching this movie now i am not a spiderman fanatic anymore.if they would have concentrated on the action as much as they did on the boring waste of time love story i would have liked this.hard to believe sam raimi made this mainstream comic book bore since he is the one who made the awesome evil dead.of course most people who like this movie won't know that anyways because this movie was obviously intended for ten year old kids who wouldn't be interested in evil dead.since most movies that are based on comic books suck it isn't much of a surprise that this movie did too.stay away unless you're ten years old.
10.0~Amazing, Spectacular... Lick It Up 112881 Sign in Permalink Both of those words are Spider-Man Comic titles, and both of them suit the movie. It was phenominal! GO SEE THIS MOVIE! Don't be left out of the conversation Monday morning. This is a film not to miss. :)
9.0~The perfect spider-man movie.... utahmaids Sign in Permalink Leave it to marvel to make a perfectly good spider-man movie. I loved every minute of this movie there was nothing wrong at all. You got Peter Parker who is just an average teenager, he goes to the science thing and is bitten by a radioactive spider. On the other side we have the green goblin who is the perfect villain for Peter to fight against. The other thing I liked about this movie is that it kind of followed the comics a little bit. Like when hes at the museum, when his uncle is shot, and the part where he goes after the robber. Another thing I liked about this movie was the actor who played Peter Parker I just have to say that Toby Macguire is the perfect Peter Parker, the guy who played green goblin was awesome too. I urge every marvel fan out there to see this I repeat if you have not seen this watch it it is awesome
10.0~Video Comment! Movie Nuttball Sign in Permalink I just bought the Spider Man film and I must say I like it a ot more than when I first saw it. Willem Dafoe`s performance is great and the character he plays "The Green Goblin" is an awesome villain! Great voice and everything! It was so neat to see the wrestling match featuring legendary wrestler he Macho Man Randy Savage (Randy Poffo) and Bruce Campbell as the ring announcer.The slow motion and fast paced action scenes are dandy!I did notice a couple errors Though it seemed like it took forever for Mary Jane to find out who Spider-Manwas after Peter Parker said something to her and then Spidey said the same thing and even when M.J. and Spidey were hanging on for dear life near the end Spidey called here M.J.When did she introduce herself to Spidey?Ohwell.I can`t wait for the sequel!
9.0~this is what I think of it. vampyre94 Sign in Permalink Well it still is the amazing spider-man. The special effects were incredible, stunts were very well coreographed, the acting was excelent. Toby Maguire is Peter and Spidey. Kristen Dunst definately MJ, no doubt there. Mr. Defoe is the Green Goblin 100%. The direction was very real, down to earth, the story was kept faithful to the comic book which is always what keeps the film great, there's nothing worst than when the writting and directing loose sight of the original stories. over all I give it a 9 out of 10.
9.0~Great fit to the Comics twigster Sign in Permalink Bummer. :( couldn't see it opening day as I originally planned but, my wife made it up to me and went with me the next day! I really enjoyed this movie! Been a fan of 'Spidey' for as long as I can remember. Been collecting the comics for some three years now. SPOILER AHEAD!!!!! This movie touched on things from the comics that I really hoped it would. Little things, like: the nickname 'Tiger' or that he never admits he's spider-man to her. (you know who 'her' is). Let me say this, I can easily take my brain give it the heave ho, not look back, and enjoy the summer movies with action. However, the dramatic scenes were so good they sort of distracted from the action scenes. Huh, go figure? You know what? I'm gonna go see it again here in an hour or two. Just as soon as I get someone else to go with me. Wanna see a good movie?
10.0~LOVED THIS MOVIE vampyress84 Sign in Permalink I've never read a Spider-Man comic and I've never really been all that interested in super heros (well maybe the TV show "Lois and Clark the new adventures of superman") aside from that I really loved this movie and I think every one should go see it not just guys and not just kids but everyone! in fact I don't think it's really a kids movie.
7.0~It's not great, but it's fun crukeg Sign in Permalink Spider-man is a good comic book movie. I have a few complaints though. It is about a science project that goes horribly wrong. Peter's best friend Harry's father has been affected, and is now the green goblin. Peter has been bitten by a spider, and his Dna has given him the characteristics of a spider. And of course, they battle. The girl he lusts after is MJ, the girl next door. This development of their friendship is interesting throughout and it gives the movie some focus. The bad: The green goblin is unconvincing. The Speed at which SM swings through the air is just ridiculous, and some of the FX are shoddy. That aside, I enjoyed the film thoroughly.
8.0~Best one yet kosmasp Sign in Permalink I know that many regard Spider Man 2 as the best Spider Man movie to date (part 4 and 5 are on it's way, but not here yet). For me personally, Spider man does the job. It's a fun (even quite a few times dark) intro into the world of Spider Man. Tobey Maguire seems so perfect in his role, it would be a shame, if someone would replace him for future installments (even though in part 3, he seemed like a mess, I do think it was the script that let him down on that one). Of course we are talking Spider Man here and not Batman, so the Origin story is lighter and more teen/kids friendly. But having Sam Raimi at the helm of the movie, it still crosses some small boundaries. The story, the character arc, the beginning, the villain ... everything fits together. It's simple, it's fun ... and it even has Bruce Campbell in it! ;o)
10.0~Oh Yeah... This Rocks! Media_guru Sign in Permalink I Absolutely LOVED this movie! It lacks no interest through out the whole thing! it's great from the very beginning and Tobey is adorable! I highly suggest this movie to anyone! after seeing it you will certainly learn what all the "hype" is about! I hope to see this one again!
6.0~Marvel-Comic-Film with high tech and no suspense! Luigi Di Pilla Sign in Permalink Yes at the end of this film I have to admit that this one is without many suspense and the story is very predictable. This movie is perhaps the best of all Marvels. Sometimes I had the sensation that the movie has been adapted for teenagers. Well it is in fact a story based on a comic book for children and comic fans. But anyway from director Sam Riami I expected more. The most of the integrated action scenes seemed to be like a video game or an animated film for kids. Okay the actors did her job at partly well and the film has some good plots. There were some unexplained situations like how Mr.Osborne turned in a bad guy but finally you have to accept that it is a comic story and that`s really all. It is too overrated. 6/10.
9.0~'It is my give and it is my curse' freemantle_uk Sign in Permalink Spider-man, Marvel's most popular superhero was finally made into a film in the early part of the 2000s after years of development hell. Many people were attached to the project, from the great and good like James Cameron, David Fincher and Tim Burton, the average Chris Columbus, to down right awful Yoram Globus. It was horror expert and Spider-man fan Sam Raimi who got the go ahead for the Spider-man project. Spider-man tells the origins of our favourite web-slinger. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is the high school geek who is bullied had has a unrequited love for Mary-Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). After a school trip to Columbia University our hero is bitten by a genetic modified spider and as a result he ends up with spider powers. He uses his these newly required powers to try and raise power for a car to impress Mary-Jane. He ends up fighting in a wrestling tournament where the promoter screws him over. As a result Peter's beloved Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) is killed. After that tragic event Peter pleads to fight crime as Spider-man. A new super-villain also comes to being, the Green Goblin. He is a major industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), the father of Peter's best friend Harry (James Franco). Norman struggles with the guilt of his evil deeds, but is a man who is facing the lost of his company. After Spider-man gets involved he develops a hatred for the super-hero. There are a lot of positives to this film. They is a decent storyline which is a much for any film. They is great action scene and Sam Raimi has a flair for the direction for this superhero film. But the winning feature is character development, from Peter's early reluctant and his longing for Mary-Jane, to Norman Osborn's guilt and duel personality. The supporting characters are also great, Mary-Jane, Harry, Uncle Ben, Aunt May and J. Jonah Jameson. The casting is fantansic. Raimi pick actors from indie backgrounds. Tobey Maguire is excellent as Peter, playing his geeky qualities and has a good dose of humour. He is an excellent actor. Willem Dafoe is also an excellent actor and makes a great villain playing the Green Goblin. Kristy Dunst and James Franco are good actors and grow into their roles in the later films. J.K. Simmons was perfect as J. Johan Jameson, adding humour to the film and Cliff Robinson and Rosemary Harris are great as Peter's aunt and uncle. David Koepp is a man who knows how to write blockbusters and excels himself here and Sam Raimi is a man who cares about the story and characters. Sadly some of the CGI is a little ropey, but Spider-man is a great start to the series and Spider-man 2 is even better.
10.0~The AMAZING spider-man!'Nuff SAID! marz1966 Sign in Permalink I have just seen one of THE best comic book adaptation movie...ever! That's right. I said it. Sam Raimi and company have sucessfully translated the 40 year old comic super-hero,Spider-Man,into what I hope to be the STANDARD of comic adaptation films. Raimi balances drama,action,humor,and romance perfectly in this film. Tobey Maguire was the best choice as Peter Parker. He is excellent. He doesn't over or underplay this part. This role will forever be his and no one elses.EVER. Kristen Dunst? With what they gave her,once again,she delivers. We see Mary Jane's fears and insecurites..but in the end how she learns that she doesn't need a man to give her an identity. Willem Dafoe as Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin gives us a deliciously evil schizo villian. There is one scene when he and the "Goblin" are having a discussion...chillingly convincing. The special effects were good,but yes,there are times where you can tell it's total CGI. Yet, the story,the action(some of the best and kind of brutal fight sequences I've seen in a comic book flick.) and,listen up you hollywood big shots,CHARACTER DEVELOPEMENT, made it forgivable. Elfman's score was good,but what is kind of distrubing,is that it sounds like the REST of his stuff.(Unlike the music he did for a Simple Plan.) Spidey fans,for the most part, will love this movie. Yes, there are a few things that could have been better..but hey, it could have been a lot worst too. I can't wait for the sequel. We got the origin story out of the way now come 2004...let's get into the GOOOd stuff!!! SEE THIS MOVIE.....and be AMAZED.
8.0~An action packed hit with a strong character-driven core. c-dub Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi's done a marvelous job of capturing the spirit and integrity of the classic comic. The first half is pure joy as we see nerdy Peter Parker transform into the human spider. The pacing and plot development is great and Raimi throws in some neat unique cinematic devices to show the development of Peter's power. Tobey Maguire is, dare I say, perfectly cast in the roll. His awkwardness, the bewilderment in his new powers, the realisation that he has become obligated to do great things, all come off in a genuine and moving progression. Equal to the task is Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborne/The Green Goblin. Raimi does a nice job of building up his character's decent into madness which lets the audience fully understand why he becomes bad. Dafoe even gets some really great 'actorly' moments that truly sell the character in an inspired way There is a bit of a letdown in the back half, largely because they're trying to juggle and wrap up a fairly complicated story. While not dissappointing, some scenes, especially the final, come off forced, but they all serve a purpose for future installments so one can't judge too harshly.
9.0~Amazing alzisdabest Sign in Permalink I loved this movie, I went back to it, expecting it to be still this good in 2019, but it's aged really well.
10.0~Sam Raimi stays faithful mojojojoap Sign in Permalink I must admit- at first, I was apprehensive. I love Sam Raimi, I love his movies, but I was not sure he'd be prepared to take on this task. Luckily, Mr. Raimi has proven me wholly, shamefully, utterly wrong. I do not believe this film could have been any better, no matter who was directing it. This film has the aura of Sam Raimi throughout, a wonderfully welcome addition. This man stays true to the fable, takes us to the test, and passes with flying colors. Anything better would have been impossible.
3.0~Extremely OVERrated noonaya Sign in Permalink I went to spiderman thinking that it is going to be childish,but entertaining. It turned out to be very childish and not entertaining at all. The movie is dull and the characters are so shallow and they dont develop anyhow throughout the film. it is not a funny movie nor an action adventure. spiderman even fails to give us the glamour of Batman movies. The ending is very annoying and it made me wonder if there is a part 2 of this movie. In conclusion if u want to see this movie i think u should wait till it comes on tv. 3/10
10.0~Simply Amazing SHB_73 Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi's Spider-Man ranks up there between Richard Donner's Superman and Tim Burton's Batman. What sets it apart from other superhero movies is it's heart. Raimi was a smart choice to direct because of his love for this character and his determination to make it more than just a two dimensional action movie. Spider-Man, (created in 1962 by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko) was the first comic book hero to have real problems and the movie centers that around all the action. He worrys about money, dates, and all the problems a normal teenager suffers, which is why the characters popularity rivals that of Superman or Batman. When Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire who was the right choice) becomes Spider-Man he uses his new found powers not to fight evil, but to make money. After being stiffed by the promoter of a wrestling match, he heads toward the elevator at the same moment a crook is running down the hall chased by a cop yelling at Peter to stop him..He does not, thinking it's not his problem. That same crook would then go on and kill his beloved Uncle Ben in a carjacking incident. Peter is beside himself with guilt knowing he could have stopped the crook, but did'nt. The movie then moves in a very fast pace which is typical of Raimi's movies, The action scenes are exciting to watch from the battles with Spider and the Green Goblin. Willem Dafoe is one of the best onscreen comic book villians since Jack Nicholson's Joker, his scenes alone are worth the price of admission, Kirsten Dunst also does a good job as Peter's love interest as Mary Jane Watson. The one problem I do have with the movie is the Green Goblin costume, It looks like something out of Power Rangers!! J.K. Simmons small part as Daily Bugle publisher J.Jonah Jameson is also hilarious. Spider-Man delivers big time!!
9.0~Great Movie, I couldn't have expected anything Better! knighty04 Sign in Permalink Now this movie was awesome; a true blockbuster. I would fullheartedly give this movie a 10, however some things could have been made to make this a "perfect" movie. Despite that, the wallcrawling action of Spider-man is exactly how a child-hood comic fanatic would envision him in reality. What is amazing is how they crammed the whole storyline of Spider-man's beginnings in such a short time without taking away from the movie or the history. Sure, you can be nitpicky and cry about how Spider-man has natural webshooters (in the comics, Peter Parker invented a spider web shooter), but I always like the idea that he had natural ones myself. With what I seen, Spider- Man could have came out in a pink tutu and I still would have been impressed. Great movie, HIGHLY recommended. Will leave you walking out the theatre as a true Spider-man fanatic!!!
9.0~Who Am I? I'm Spider-Man zurnd Sign in Permalink If there is one superhero I relate to the most, it's the web slinging Spider-Man. Ever since I was a kid, this red and blue, wall crawling arachnid has also been the superhero I saw myself in, the superhero I can see myself portraying. When the 2002 film starring Tobey Maguire came along, I was as excited as a leprechaun locked in a chamber full of beer. This superb superhero flick is up there on my favorite superhero film list and even if sequels have come along as well as a stellar reboot, this film still holds a special place in my heart. This is a shining jewel in the comic book based movie category and when it comes to Spidey films, this is a feast fit for any Spidey fan. The comic book look and feel of the film must be praised. Sam Raimi and his team surely came through in delivering a great comic panel to silver screen transition and making us feel like we were watching a comic book come to life. From the New York skyscrapers to the abandoned warehouse to the film's web slinging scenes, you really feel like your sucked into the motion picture and every, jaw dropping moment. You feel like a piece of the pie, and this film is a pie that will make any comic book guru go bonkers. This film hearkens back to the great Steve Ditko stories of the golden age of comics and really delivers a scope and feeling of epicness. Spider- Man is mighty and the actor portraying him is radical. Tobey Maguire gives us a more serious Spider-Man than the wise cracking one seen in the panels of the comics, but he still has a touch of humor here and there and really fits in Spidey's shoes perfectly. When it comes to playing Spidey's alter ego, Peter Parker, Tobey also hits a home run and really portrays him as an average ordinary everyday teenager. Many people, including myself can relate to Maguire's take on Parker/Spidey, for he plays him as a realistic, determined fellow just trying to make his way in the world. William Dafoe is great as the Green Goblin, giving us a menacing and hilarious villain who loves being villainous. I will admit, his costume is a bit ridiculous, but it's not the worst I've ever seen. It's a lot better looking than Halle Berry's Catwoman, that's for sure! The other actors are also good in their aliases. James Franco is a rebellious, yet headstrong Harry Osborn and Rosemary Harris is a sweet, grandmotherly Aunt May (More wheat cakes, Petey?). Kirsten Dunst is as Mary Jane as you can get, although she can be a little petulant at times, especially in the later films. And of course, the great Bruce Campbell in all his glory makes an appearance. Him and Sam Raimi are like peanut butter and jelly, and Campbell always knows how to make his cameos work, giving us brief, yet funny and memorable moments. Did anyone see his cameo in the latest Oz movie? Overall, Spider-Man is a fun, whirling and twirling action packed suspense thriller that will have you entangled in it's awesomeness ever second. Honestly, I could sit here for countless hours talking about the grand action scenes, the iconic dialogue, and the cheesy, yet comic book inspired special effects, but IMDb has a limit, and I gotta keep it short. Spider-Man is just a head spinning ride of unexpectedness and epicness, but doesn't hold a candle to the sequel that would follow two years later. We'll get to that one some other time.
9.0~"Who am I? I'm Spider-Man!" MatrixG Sign in Permalink A favorite of my.End of discussion. When I first seen it in cinema I knew it that it going too be.And it still is even if it past almost a decade from the release. The movie leaved in me the feeling of the super heroism what brings too responsibility in a way that no other superhero movie did. Beside the great story of Spider-Man, in this first movie the atmosphere is greatly managed with the great romance between Peter and M.J. (The Spider-Man Kiss winning MTV Movie Award for Best Kiss). The action is great, there are a lots of funny moments in the movie, specially when Jonah Jameson the publisher of the "Daily Bugle" is on the scene, and the money spend on the movie can be felled in every moment of the picture. Tobey Maguire is great as Spider-Man , and the rest of the cast the same. With no doubt on of the best comic-book adaptation, the movie made his expectations in every way Thank's Sam Raimi
10.0~THIS'S GREAT!!!!!! tzdacy Sign in Permalink This is the greatest movie I've ever seen. I really like the story. I've never see the spider-man comic book before. After I seen this movie, I'm crazy about spider-man!!! Spider-man COOL!!!!
8.0~BAD...REALLY BAD!!!!!!!! bcwashburn Sign in Permalink This movie was so lame. I thought it was going to be really good but when I saw it, I wanted to pull my hair out, The acting is what killed the movie, Tobey and kirsten dunst were really bad, This isnt the kinda movie for Tobey, he needs to stick with those stupid drama's and kirsten dunst needs to take more acting lessons. If people think spider-man 2 will be better then the first, dream on, if they stick with these actors, then the movie shouldnt even be released. Kinda sad when so many people go and see a stupid movie like this
6.0~Didn't suck, didn't rule Alucard 6 Sign in Permalink I have been a fan of Spider-Man for more than 20 years, so watching this film while not being too critical over every detail meeting my expectations, was quite a challenge. To me, it was a roller coaster ride of kudos and de-merit points. Kudos on his costume, J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, the special effects of his webbing, the parade scene, and keeping somewhat true to the original story. Major de-merit points for the Green Goblin. He is my #1 Spidey villian and they made an atrocity out of him. Not only does his costume design bore ZERO resemblance to the original, it's also missing it's signature two-tone color combination of green AND purple.(For shame on you!) And Defoe's casting, along with Dunst, Franco, and especially Manganiello will always be a mystery to me. They look NOTHING like their characters. (That is, if you're like me, coming from the original Ditko/Romita Sr. versions) As for bringing these comic book characters "to life", I can't say they bowled me over with their performances. On the other hand, there actually were times were Maguire would look a certain way and I thought "Wow! That really IS Peter Parker!" For someone who could care less about these details, this is an exciting movie to watch, and I must give them credit for taking it seriously, instead of approaching it as a big summer blockbuster with no plot or meaning. The only sad thing is, is that it wasn't "special". Like when you watch Star Wars. Spider-man is a very special character, with a special story to tell, and this movie, although it gets a A for trying, just didn't hit that "special" mark.
10.0~Fantastic👌 iprincechaurasia Sign in Permalink The first Spider-Man film is a great one. Marvel arrived on the scene in 2000 with the solid if unspectacular "X-Men," but it was kicked into higher gear in 2002 with the release of "Spider-Man."
1.0~sub par characters and sub par effects martind1 Sign in Permalink With the costumes the Goblin and Spiderman wear their dialog is all voice, and no facial features. Watching a dialog between the 2 is as uneventful as watching a film with dubbed voices. There is just no emotion with the voices. IF you add this into unspectacular special effects. Too much fakeness and its not even fake in the comic book sense. In my opinion it does not hold true to the comics. *** - semi-spoiler ahead - *** My last complaint is with the story line of how Spiderman creates his webbing. In the comic it is created chemically and deployed mechanically. Why did they feel it was necessary to change this in the movie?
9.0~A Fantastic Ride ObiWanDan131 Sign in Permalink Movie Production When I first heard the rumours of a Spiderman movie I was not really convinced that it will come, because there had been rumours for many years with directors coming and going. There were many directors being named nearly every year like James Cameron and even Tim Burton. But I most say I was always excited about the idea of a Spiderman movie, because I really enjoy superhero films like X-Men and Batman (except Batman & Robin). But when Spiderman was eventually green lighted and a Director named it ws great. But I most say a was pretty shocked about the Director turning out to be Sam Raimi because he was never named before. But after the shock past I thought the Evil Dead director will be brill at bringing Spiderman to life. But with each cast member getting named I could not stop myself from getting excited about this movie. Tobey Maguire- Peter Parker/Spiderman (Genius) Kirsten Dunst- Mary Jane Watson (Thank you) William Dafoe- Norman Osborn/Green Goblin (Brilliant) I have always enjoyed Tobey Maguire in all of the movies he has been in because he always plays a luckable character that you can take in, like in Cider House Rules, Plesantville, Ice Storm and Wonder Boys. The Movie The great thing about this film is that it focuses on Peter Parker and how his life chances after being bit by a genetically enhanced spider. The movie is a fun ride from Peter Parker trying out his knew powers all way through to the final battle between Spiderman and the Green Goblin. The dramatic scenes in the movie are very well performed also with them really showing the emotions of the characters and it really shows the audience how human Peter Parker is. In the Batman movies Bruce Wayne never felt human just a stone cold person with no real personality, but Peter Parker does. All the other characters are evolved well also and they just don't fall into the shadows. The Green Goblin was the best villain I have seen in years and William Dafoe was the perfect casting. The scenes with Spiderman and the Green Goblin were really entence with them really feeling like a good verses evil battle. I especially liked it when the New York citizens decided to help Spiderman. Some of the scenes with Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson were a bit to sickly but I guess they needed some of that emotion to show the audience the strong feeling between them. The special effects were great and I glad they waited this long to make the film because the effects would not be as good as this 5 years ago. I believe that the parents who want to knock down the certificate to PG so there kids can watch it, should go and watch it first because I thought the violence was definitely to violent for a PG cert and closer to a 15. Verdict This film really shows other directors how to make a good superhero movie. Sam Raimi is the Spiderman king. 9 out of 10
5.0~stupid ending donzup Sign in Permalink The whole film is quite enjoying though a bit childish, but the end, with the violin scene, the ridiculous tear-drawer love story is completeley ridiculous and screws the whole movie making the whole theater die of laugh !
8.0~The best comic book portrayal yet J-Dogg Sign in Permalink When I was a child, I wasn't really into comic books or cartoons all that much. On occasion, I would watch The Adventures of Batman and Robin, The X-Men, and Spider-man. Out of these three cartoons that eventually became movies, Spider-man is by far my favorite. While I don't remember much about the storyline from the cartoon, the specials I have seen on television about the making of Spider-man say they tried to make it as accurate of a depiction as they possibly could. It showed. It did a great job of telling the story of how Spider-man came into being and why he became the crime-fighter he is (and for those who are like me who weren't a big comic-book follower, I'm not spilling it). The action sequences and computer generated effects were also amazing. The casting was very good as well. My roommate and I actually had an argument over how he couldn't believe they would cast a "dork" like Tobey McGuire as Spider-man, but I actually had to remind him that Peter Parker WAS a dork. I don't know if I'll ever convince my roommate that Tobey McGuire was the perfect role, but he is. And it's incredible how much time he put into getting into shape in order to be Spider-man. Word is he spent sometimes more than 4 hours a day getting 'ripped.' Kirsten Dunst (who is my on-again-off-again favorite actress) was also perfect in her role as MJ. She has played similar role types in the past (such as Torrance in Bring It On), and I must say she is SO attractive in red hair! :) So, yes, I would recommend this movie to anyone who is up for a good action movie, regardless of whether they had a detailed comic book following or not
9.0~Raimi spins a charming web. onebadshutyourmouth Sign in Permalink This movie has everything a film needs to be successful... big budget effects, solid cast,romance, and humor. However, the one thing it has a lot of blockbusters lack is a general concern to tell a good solid story with fully realized characters. Raimi's version had to put a smile on Stan Lee's face, because the first hour of the film captures the charm of the character and the comic. At then end of the movie, the theater I saw this in broke out with applause. The cast and crew deserve that applause for not relying only on the effects and gee whiz action scenes (attention Mr. Lucas LOL). Spiderman is a charming, fun, and well put together movie. 9/10
3.0~Spider-man, a superhero who falls flat beckbee-2 Sign in Permalink I was going into this movie expecting a light, fun, entertaining action movie, and for the most part I was right. I was interested in how Peter Parker was turned into spider-man, and I found the scenes where he came up with the concept for "spider-man" amusing, but once he decided to become a "superhero" I started looking at my watch. This movie did not hold my attention, and I found the costume of the Green Goblin laughable. The fight scene at the end was trite and EXTREMELY predictable. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are cute together, but they don't have very many scenes together. (Not that anyone would go to a movie like this expecting anything but a love interest that spider-man has to save). I think that this movie could have been a lot better if it was re-edited. It seems to jump for one part to another with no rhyme nor reason. Willem Dafoe's scenes where he is talking to the Green Goblin are interesting, but why was time getting the audience to pity the bad guy? Going into the movie you already now that something will happen to Mary Jane, and that Spider-man will save her and get rid of the bad guy, all the audience cares about is how it plays out. To me this movie was slow, (we didn't see the Green Goblin until 45 minutes into the movie) and never did anything to make me engage with the characters. Spider-man is a beautiful looking movie and we all know how great CGI can be, it no long impresses me to see how real they can make stuff look, now it is important to use CGI with a purpose. All in all the movie was slightly entertaining with way too much set up and a rather jumbled plot. But, it is light and for the most part it is fun
1.0~Good effects, but story way too thin mgerben Sign in Permalink Granted, the movie deserves a few points for the effects. But the problem with making a movie about Spiderman is that you are bound by the frame of the original comics. You can't go too far, so the storyline is fixed. The story takes one of his many enemies from the comics. He has to fight this ultimate bad guy, nearly looses, and I don't want to spoil it for you, but he gets up and wins in the end (where have we seen that before?). Of course we've seen that genre before, but this film lacks everything original. Bat Man, Superman, Robocop: this movie is just more of the same. But Spiderman stands apart in that it has nothing going for it whatsoever: not an interesting story, no incredible effects, no humour. The film ends unfinished and unsatisfying, with an opening for follow-ups whenever the Hollywood-producers are short on cash in the near future. You'll miss nothing if you don't see this film.
9.0~web slinging at its best hcalderon1 Sign in Permalink Peter Parker is a typical 18 year old who is smart, but is picked on by Jocks and is too shy to talk to the beautiful Mary Jane Watson who lives next door. Until the day he is bitten by a radio active spider, then the next day he feels different, he can sense things coming at him, he can spin a web, he also has incredible strength, and he can stick to walls. At first Peter decides to use his new powers for show, but after a terrible tragedy, Peter decides to use his powers to stop crime and help people, by becoming Spiderman. Then a super villain called the green Goblin is bent on mass destruction, it is then up to Spiderman to stop him. I enjoyed this movie because it had a lot of action and was not boring.
10.0~a very fun experience! captain619 Sign in Permalink Let me just start with that I am not a big comic book fan. I read a couple but they never grew on me. I went to see this movie because I am a real big Sam Raimi(the director)fan. I loved his early work such as the EVIL DEAD trilogy,& DARKMAN. they are great films, but with SPIDER-MAN, Sam Raimi and crew delivers, big time. With a mix of stunning special effects, great costuming, wonderful actors,and a great story line, this film makes other super hero films look like kareokee at your local bar, sure it would be fun to participate, but when its time to watch, you can't help but cringe. I love the way this movie is shot. somehow they were able to film this in such a way, that when Spidey is swinging, it feels like your right there swinging with him. With all of those things I mentioned and a Danny Elfman score, this movie is a very fun experience. I give it a 10!!!!
6.0~Best Comic Book Adaptation Ever! simian123 Sign in Permalink I have seen many different comic-to-film attempts. There have been some succeses such as X Men and Blade. However, none come any where close to this new land mark of a movie. Bringing new dimentions to spider man while keeping all of his famous trade marks. Toby Maguire is a really believable Peter Parker and plays the part beautifully. The Green Goblin is a scary yet not too serious arch-rivle for the webbed wonder. Special effects in the film are astounding and bring the film to life on the big screen. An epic film, excellent SFX, funny, witty, exciting and truely mind blowing. This is a film for every one not just fans but all the familly.
8.0~A cool movie Mission31 Sign in Permalink This movie is the best superhero movie to date. It does not just show you spider-man it shows you the emotion of peter parker as well. The action scenes are well directed as well as dialogue. The only bad thing is that in the comics spidey would always crack a joke, but in this he doesn't. The director,sam raimi is a comic book fan so he is the perfect choice for this film. The costume design in this film is amazing, especially the green goblins costume. The green goblin dies in the end but peter learns that with great power there must also come great responsobility. I think it is an excellent film to sit in and watch on a Friday night.Definitely the best super hero film in the last decade,if not the last two decades. Buy it on DVD now!!!!!
6.0~Not a Top 250 film Flicks-11 Sign in Permalink I got to see this at a sneak as well. Maybe if I had read the comics when I was younger I would appreciate the film more. No, I don't think so. Granted, Spider-Man was my favorite superhero when I was a kid. I had an action figure with a motorcycle, helicopter, etc. and Dr. Octopus. Now, I'd like to see Dr. Octopus in a movie. This movie, I feel, did not live up to its billing. I enjoyed and even laughed during the scenes where Parker is just learning the ropes of his new powers ("Go web go!"). But once he, or should I say a CGI, started swinging around I lost interest. It was too fake. I guess if the movie had come out about five years ago, the images would have wowed me, but it just didn't flow together. It did seem a little anti-climactic as well. Willem Dafoe was not used to his fullest potential. His Goblin was too impersonal (perhaps it was the ridiculously robotic outfit). Anyway, it's not a Top 250 film, but I guess the comic book geeks have spoken.
5.0~Tobey Good, Willem Bad Bradford-4 Sign in Permalink Not a bad movie all around, but I don't understand the $114 million opening weekend. Chalk it up to great marketing, I guess. Tobey Maguire's performance is great, and though I love Willem Dafoe, I felt he was a bad choice to play the Green Goblin. On the other hand, the scene with Kirsten Dunst in the rain was nearly worth the price of admission by itself.
1.0~Horrible for something that should've been better drosales Sign in Permalink With the expectation that the summer 2002 season was to be one of the most exciting in years for moviegoers, I was hopeful that the fierce competition would rub off in finally bringing about the better qualities often lacking in blockbusters these days. Not only did Spider Man fail in that regard, but I was quite disappointed by the fact that it actually had the potential to be a very a decent film. The liberal use of cliches which I wasn't expecting really caught me off guard. Didn't these guys learn anything from the dismal Batman 4 movie? That wasn't the worst part, however. The wooden acting by what should've been a stellar cast, at least on paper, fell flat on its back, while the continuity and lackadaisical visual effects suggested to me that this was a rush job. How the heck duffers like this and ~Batman & Robin~ were even allowed to see the light of day, and still be able to pull in as much money as they did is totally mind-boggling and disheartening. This I can only attribute to "business as usual" in Hollywood.... it's less a matter of quality, and one more of hype and hype and hype w/TV commercials until the masses come a flocking like sheep to a shepherd. Baa-aa-aa-ah! If somebody recommends to you that this movie is great and you should go and see it, don't believe them! If you're curious, just wait until it comes out on video and rent it for $1. You'll feel a whole lot better knowing that you could've wasted an extra $9 (but didn't) at the AMC for this bile garbage!
7.0~Tobey Maguire carries the film mjwworld Sign in Permalink Tobey Maguire is great as Spiderman, and it's neat that he finally got such a big break (not that his earlier accomplishments were small, as "Cider House Rules" was magnificent.) All in all, it was a very fun film to see. However, it's not one of those that will make me come back to see it again, so therefore it gets a 7 in my rating scale.
10.0~A new superhero is here! filkingian Sign in Permalink I don´t want to spoil this movie for someone(cause it is one of the best I´ve ever seen in the genre!!), so I´ll make it short. I saw it today and it was perfect! I´ve missed a REAL superhero sence Chritopher Reeve and Michael Keaton retired as superman and batman. X-men didn´t quite fulfill my expectations, but spiderman were even better than I possibly could hope (and I´ve reed the swedish spidermag for 16 years). Sam Raimi have created a masterpiece and Tobey Maguire feels like the "real" spiderman, just like Reeve and Keaton once did as super and batman.
7.0~A film for comic lovers and action buffs rowrulz Sign in Permalink I went into the cinema expecting big things from this movie. It's been a huge success in the States and has been critically acclaimed for being a great action blockbuster. Getting straight to the point, the movie wasn't quite what I was hoping for. I still enjoyed it as the action sequences were pretty cool and Tobey Maguire was excellent as the gawky Peter Parker. I think they could have done with a bit more humour and a bit more character building. The Green Goblin was a little TOO outrageous in my opinion also. The worst thing for me though was the lovey dovey scenes...bleh! Definitely worth seeing. Fans of the comic book will love it, as will action fans in general. 7/10.
7.0~Not A 100% Attention Grabber brfcarecrap Sign in Permalink Having watched the first 25 minutes or so I thought I was in for a treat. Well, I was partly right. The film had my attention right from the off, with some, as expected, nice special effects & some good dialogue. Sadly for me it all seemed to become a little boring through much of the middle part of the film. A few loud bangs, the odd fight, but nothing that actually continued to grab my attention. Then, to my pleasent surprise, the film picked up again for a nice finale. As I've said, the expected special effects were very good, but for me the best part was the bitter sweet ending. The writing was on the wall for an old fashioned weepy happy ending, but it never came. Peter Parker 'Spiderman', unable to give his love to Mary Jane Watson for the cursed reason of him being Spiderman.
8.0~Great fun La Gremlin Sign in Permalink Well, you've heard it enough times that it's like a broken record, but you are going to have a grand old time at "Spider-Man". I will say that you'll appreciate it a lot more if you're familiar with the story. Even so, go and have fun. Trust me. At this point, you'll feel like a mutant if you don't.
5.0~Another so called Super Hero jari.hamalainen Sign in Permalink I don't know if this movie should be compared to X-Men, but because they both are made by Marvel Comics I feel necessary to do the comparison. After X-men I expected a lot from this movie, but after seeing it I am quite disapointed. For my taste it was far too much ment for early teens. And the cast was not so impressive either. As a conclusion I'd say 6-0 for X-men.
9.0~Oh yeah! tekfreak Sign in Permalink Nicely done, well paced, well acted and fun movie. Effects were ropey in places and the goblin is a power ranger, which was probably the most distracting thing in the whole film. Still, if this is the sort of movie we can now expect Marvel franchises to be turned in to, I'll be queuing up on opening night every time. The final swing through the city is excellent. My hope is that all the CGI in the next movie excels it.
9.0~The awesome power of Sam Raimi and Stan Lee AwesomeWolf Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi is awesome. Stan Lee is awesome. Stan Lee created Spider-Man, who is awesome. And then Stan Lee had a love-child with Sam Raimi - it was the long awaited 'Spider-Man' movie, and it was awesome. Sometimes even I don't understand what I'm talking about. Growing up, I was a fan of the 'Spider-Man' cartoon that ran from 1994 to 1998. It was awesome. I never really collected the comics, I read the occasional one, and I still do, and the games on Super Nintendo were fun. One day, I picked up a Spider-Man comic, and at the end was a page from 'The Daily Bugle', announcing that 10 years of legal battles were over. A 'Spider-Man' movie would be made. I was so happy, that my head nearly exploded with happiness. Thankfully, any head explosions were avoided. I still don't quite understand what I'm talking about. Onto the movie. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a science-geek who doesn't fit in at school, and whose only friend is Harry Osborne (James Franco), the son Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe), a scientist and head-honcho of his own company. On a field trip (to genetics laboratory of all places), Peter is bitten by a spider (a genetically enhanced 'super-spider' no less). Naturally, instead of any negative side-effects, Peter finds he now possesses spider-like powers. Meanwhile, on the evil side of town, Norman Osborne is working on a chemical human performance enhancer. With the threat of his funding being pulled, Norman tests the prototype out himself, and it works perfectly, save for him going rather insane. With a super-hero in town and no super-villains in sight, Norman dubs himself 'the Green Goblin' and runs off to cause some chaos. Any movie based on a comic is going to have mess around with the facts of the comic, the story, characters, order of events can't stay exactly the same. 'Spider-Man' is no different, but the core is the same. The reason for Peter Parker to be Spider-Man is there, the original moral of 'Spider-Man' is maintained throughout the whole movie - "with great power comes great responsibility". It was good to see the message was still there. Don't discredit it either, I can think of various examples where this message can be applied to the real world (American foreign policy, for instance). The acting is the strongest point movie. Tobey Maguire does the whole geeky Peter / uber-cool Spider-Man thing so well. If I said to Randy Savage, a pro-wrestler and rapper, what Spidey did, I'd probably be killed straight away. Willem Dafoe is great as the insane Green Goblin, ditto Rosemary Harris as Aunt May. Better yet, was J.K. Simmons who seemed to be J. Jonah Jameson to a tee, and Jameson is cool. Speaking of cool, Bruce Campbell has a cameo. It might not be as Ash, but its still the King, baby. Bruce Campbell is awesome. I'm not even talking about the movie anymore, am I? Unfortunately, the action scenes are the only real down point of the movie. Most of them very heavy on not-so-good CGI effects. I'm probably being a little unfair, as I think nearly all CGI effects are poor. That being said, I still enjoyed Spider-Man's showdown with the Green Goblin. Honestly, 'Spider-Man' never really seemed all that violent to me anyway, so it isn't much of a problem. Action aside, 'Spider-Man' is still one of the best super-hero movies out there. Worth a look for anyone - 9/10
9.0~You'll Definitely Get Caught In The Web BlackX Sign in Permalink Firstly, my only major complaint is James Franco as Harry Osborn. He is a total Dawson's Creek reject who's terrible at acting. He talked in one tone the entire movie: "Whatever.". Hate him. Otherwise, a great movie this is. James Franco mercifully has a minor role. Tobey Maguire was an excellent choice for Peter Parker, and if you don't like him as Spider-Man, too bad, because he really pulled back the troubled yet determined Spider-Man we all knew and loved, and he's coming back. As you may expect from a super-hero movie, this film had a big budget, special effects, known, if not major, actors and actresses, and great sets. But Spider-Man has been known to push the envelope a lot in the comics, and the same is said here. The special effects, though mostly good, lacked in realism when it was replacing a human figure. It immediately changed colour, speed, and stuck out when it went to CGI. Other than some web-swinging, the special effects lacked when they were really 100% necessary, and the screen tests on the DVD show that they were not really improved as the movie was made. It seemed like as they darkened the scene it was all supposed to look better, and it did, but only to a limited extent. The acting is the core of this movie. Tobey Maguire was an excellent if surprising choice, really bringing back the days of the new, teenage Spider-Man compared to the expected major action of today, yet modernized it effectively, one of their goals, so we believed the movie happened in present day, not the swinging sixties. Kirsten Dunst was another surprising yet excellent choice as Mary Jane, improving on the damsel in distress character with a new flair to make the relationship with Parker more believable. I'll just skip the paragraph or two on James Franco. I unfortunately had never heard of Willem Dafoe before this movie, which is a shame, because he's an excellent actor, especially his voice difference. Uncle Ben was strangely modernized to the 21st century, apparently with a great sports interest. Aunt May was perfectly played, except for the shocking introductory scene when she calmly tells Ben not to fall on his a**. J. Jonah Jameson, slightly taller but with the exact same personality that made him such a joy to hate, is greatly played, and half of you wanted more footage of him, and half of you were glad his jerk character was short. Unfortunately, I forget all these wonderful actors' names. The sets were grand, big and detailed, and Times Square(also apparently a set!) really brought the webbed wonder to 2002. I didn't like the eventually annoying marketing gimmicks, with everything from Dr. Pepper to Cingular Wireless network. The action scenes were well choreographed, always in the right mood or atmosphere and never repetitive or boring. But it could've been a little better. It still suited Spidey well. The wardrobe was one of the best of a movie I've ever seen, and thank God they rejected the clothes from the screen tests. The main costumes focused on, Spidey and the Green Goblin, don't disappoint. Sam Raimi should be really proud. A grand movie worth whatever you paid to see it. Please, though, keep it safe and don't make any risks for "The Amazing Spider-Man"(the second movie). We don't want this to be another Batman. The 4 decades of risk-taking, moral-teaching, twist-and-turn-stories of the Spider-Man era should not be let down. No pressure, though!
10.0~Beautifully done! dwillson Sign in Permalink I know that lots of people will have differing opinions of this movie, But in my opinion, Spider Man was one of the best movies that i had seen in a long time. It was fulfilling on so many levels for me. I laughed at the comedic parts and I teared up in the sad and emotional scenes. I never really read any of the comics but i knew what to expect in general. I thought that the roles were beautifully casted, and even though I could see the transition from real people to CGI, it didn't take any enjoyment away from the movie. This is definitely a movie that I will go see again!
8.0~A hair raising Film handcomp Sign in Permalink When I first saw this I couldn't believe it Growing up you see the cartoons but seeing the movie was a whole different experince. I loved this and if Toby MAguire doesn't come back to do the next film I'm not seeing it. He did A great job and no one else could fill his shoes or costume. This movie was not just the top grossing film in the box office for 2002 but it also was the best.I think that the only thing the could have done better was that MJ's Boyfriend could have been a bigger star. I would have liked to see Toby take down a big star! Movies I would reccomend:Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship, The Lord of the Rings:the Two Towers, How to Deal, Legally Blond 2, Pirates of the CArribean, League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen, X-Men2, Finding Nemo, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days Movies I would not reccomend: The Hulk, Bringing Down the House
10.0~Awesome!!!! TheMan3051 Sign in Permalink This is the greatest comic book adapted movie since Batman in 1989. Everyone is amazing and every sequence is amazing and Kirsten Dunst is amazingly sexy in this movie. Especially during that rain sequence. ****out of**** stars
7.0~No 'X-Men,' but still entertaining aliceboy Sign in Permalink I should preface anything I'm about to say by saying I don't like superheroes. These men (and women) in tights are holdovers from when comics were aimed strictly at kids, but now are being read by adults. They cast the world in tones of black and white (or, in the case of this movie, red-and-blue and green...) and oversimplify morality in a way only the real-life comic logic of organised religion does better. This said, I have to admit that I liked this movie. I worked in a comic shop for 10 years, and during that time witnessed the beginning of the recent boom in comic-book movies. Customers would get completely worked up over the latest spandex thriller to hit the big screen, but I'm only catching these movies years later on the small screen. Originally, I hadn't planned to give any synopsis on this story, thinking that if you were going to see this and didn't already know the story behind the spider I had no sympathy for you. However, I then found my own wife had no idea how Peter Parker got his superpowers, so here goes... Mild-mannered ubergeek Peter Parker lives with his elderly Aunt May and uncle Ben, next door to his longtime crush Mary-Jane Watson(who doesn't have any interest in him, of course). On a field trip, he's bitten by a scientifically altered spider, and finds himself endowed with special spidery powers...and a buff new physique! Naturally, being a much-downtrodden teenager, his first instinct is to use these powers to impress girls. Or, more specifically, one girl: Mary-Jane. However, through a series of events, his own actions lead to his beloved uncle's death, and he realises what his late uncle said was true: 'With great power comes great responsibility.' He thereafter commits himself to fighting crime with his newfound abilities. Wackiness ensues...I mean, ADVENTURE ENSUES! The story, at its roots, is pretty true to the source material, for better or worse. On the plus side, the movie maintains the childish charm of a comic book; on the minus, the movie doesn't really surpass the childish charm of a comic book. My only real beef with this movie was probably just a technical limitation of the time (only a few short years ago) when digital effects were STILL not up to bringing this particular character to the screen. While Tobey Maguire pulls some great physical acting out of his performance, it becomes all too clear when the switch is made to a computer-generated 'person' clumsily climbing the side of a building or swinging through the city. I can only imagine such effects looking much, much worse twenty feet high on the big screen. Sam Raimi, who brought us the much-beloved 'Evil Dead' trilogy (and countless other truly crappy movies), is a good choice to helm this flick. His work in 'Army of Darkness,' 'Darkman' and others show he has both an understanding of what makes these stories appealing as well as an appreciation for faithful adaptation of the superhero ethos. The downside of this, is that Parker, arch-nemesis Norman Osborn, Aunt May and the others end up consigned to the otherworldly realm of comics. They never at all approach believable real-life characters, and this removes the viewer from the 'reality' of their world (both the viewer's AND the characters' worlds). Compare this to Bryan Singer's work on 'X-Men.' He managed to take the equally ridiculous other Marvel/Stan Lee icons and mold them into acceptable members of the world we live in. Sure, they have superpowers/mutations, but they also have believable personalities and interactions with reality. I suppose the difference lies in what you want from your superhero: for a reasonable adaptation of the superhero into our world, see the 'X-Men' movies; for pure escapist fantasy, see 'Spider-Man.' Either way, you're not liable to be disappointed as both pack thrills and visual excitement into their brightly coloured packages.
8.0~Best Visual Effects this year! MovieCritic20497 Sign in Permalink When I saw this movie, I thought it wouldn't be as great as what it seemed. But, boy was I wrong? This movie was really good. The graphics were awsome, it had a pretty good plot, and Kirsten Dunst! I advise anybody whose anybody to go see this movie. It's the best movie this year next to John Q. (2002)
5.0~Great movie, poor FX stevenfallonnyc Sign in Permalink Spider-Man was always my fave comic character after The Thing from the Fantastic Four, so I have been waiting for this film for a LONG time. With Sam Raimi directing, you know it's gonna be good, and Spider-Man certainly was. Unfortunately, the "special effects" sucked big-time. What is with all the CGI in movies today? "Spider-man" during the action sequences especially, looked like a cartoon. I don't care if you do it with a pen, pencil, or computer - it's a DRAWING. A cartoon. And it shows. CGI "special effects" are making movies look like crap. The action sequences in "Spider-Man" looked like scenes from a Playstation videogame. "Superman" and "Superman 2" were made almost 25 years ago, and their special effects completely blow away the cartoons in the new "Spider-Man." Think about that - FX have degressed so much that a 25-year old film has better effects than one of today's blockbusters. Compare the scenes - Superman's first scene, Spidey's first scene; Superman's big battle with the supervillians on the streets of Metropolis/Spidey vs. The Green Goblin in NYC on the Queensboro bridge; the final shot of Superman and the final shots of Spiderman...it goes on. In every case, the FX of Superman were real flesh and blood FX, and the FX of Spider-Man were fake looking cartoons. Otherwise, "Spider-man" was a really good movie, nice direction, good acting and casting, Bruce Campbell, the "car" (whoever doesn't get that one should do their Raimi homework), and other nice pluses. Jameson was great but seriously underused. But really, these asinine cartoon FX have got to go. They are making movies look horrible. The sad thing is, many people don't seem to care, and the computer geeks that sit at their computers and draw these FX actually think they look good. They don't. Some people may say, "they wanted a comic-book feel," but they don't understand that when you spend $120 million on a film, it's not supposed to LOOK like a comic book or a cartoon. The 1967 Spider-Man cartoon had "special effects" as good as the new movie, only drawn differently. And say what you want about the cheesy 1978 TV series - at least it was REAL FLESH AND BLOOD and not a CARTOON! For me, the best parts in "Spider-Man" were when Spider-Man was OUT of costume as Peter Parker. Because those scenes weren't a cartoon. Anyone who wants to see real FX, watch the first two Superman films (heck even 3 and 4). "Spider-Man" was a good film that could have been great if only it had real special effects.
10.0~amazing a brave fan Sign in Permalink i'm not sure who was more excited to see this movie my husband or the kids. either way it was well worth all of us taking off work and school early to catch the first show of the day. can't wait for the sequel. the cast was great. great villain, great hero. i will see this movie again and again.
10.0~F/X fun nadiamerrill Sign in Permalink _Spider-Man_ is an f/x laden rollar coaster ride that is very reminiscent of the comic books that it's based on. The director obviously had a deep affection for his source material. Fast paced and witty, a "must see" for the summer.
7.0~Great Flick woffi Sign in Permalink I really loved it. I'm 38 now, and I loved the comic when I was a kid - and i sure was willing to spend some time with a simple story like that again. Didn't regret it - but you would, if you don't like Superhero comics.
9.0~The first big success of Marvel yuuliiaan Sign in Permalink There is no doubt that 2002 has seen the birth of the best first party has ever had a superhero on the big screen. Many consider this film as part of his childhood, even adolescence. With this title many we have grown, we have excited and even cheered for excellence that brought us Sam Raimi. The years will pass, but the winner will remain the glorious 2002, as I saw from the beginning what would be the best superhero adaptation at the time, and, without doubt, the best first of all films of superheroes . A large repertoire of actors, Tobey Maguire with the size of the character, as well as a lucid Dunts Kirsten in his role and, of course, Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin by one of the greatest villains in the superhero movie, I even encourage say the cinema in general. Spider-Man is a film which many have sinned could not see at the time, as they have lost, perhaps, one of the biggest releases of the history of cinema. Never a first part of the genus replace Spider- man. Wall-crawler fans, can stay in peace.
10.0~The web-heads triumphant debut on the silver screen andrewnmiller Sign in Permalink When I was a kid, Spiderman was always a character that I was aware of, but never much cared for apart from the 90s animated show, so when I went to see the movie in the summer of '02, I was pretty excited to see it and it didn't let me down. From it's superb direction and themes to it's acting and effects, Spiderman is a revolutionary movie in the superhero genre. The movie follows a high schooler named Peter Parker who is an outsider and can't bring himself to open up to his childhood crush, Mary Jane, but after being bitten by a genetically enhanced spider, Peter discovers that he has gained new abilities, but after his uncle is murdered, Peter decades to use his powers for good and learn what it means to have power and responsibility. One of the more difficult tasks with bringing a character like Spiderman to the big screen is to give the audience plenty of background information on the lead character in order for us to care about him because if there is too much focus on the heroes origin then it tends to slow the movie down but if the viewer is given too little then they won't connect with the hero. This is something Sam Raimi is able to hit the right notes with by setting up our hero in the few minutes of the movie as we see Peter as a nerdy outsider, allowing the viewer to get to know him better, while another part of the movie's charm is the grand and beautiful style added to it thanks to the bouncy and attentive directing from Sam and writer David Koepp's engaging dialog which allows the story to unfold and allows each character to develop as the movie progresses and while Koepp's script might have an out-of-date touch to it, it feels like Burton's Batman when it comes to format and dialog and can come across as a bit off-putting, it still adds to the movie's charms and makes it a lot more timeless. While Spiderman's origin is incredibly simple, it feels akin to Donner's Superman, telling the whole story of how the hero comes to be while Rami and Koepp approach the movie with a great deal of respect for the original 60s comic book by maintaining all the major elements of the story like the spider bite and Uncle Ben's murder but don't try to put their own spin on it, rather they adjust certain facts to apply to modern day and the end product is an enduring and touchingly inspiring origin perfectly suiting the character and Sam is able to get the tone of the movie just perfectly by letting the movie have a sense of fun, but never forgets the core message of the story and gives ample devotion to the serious stuff too. As for the look and feel of the film, Raimi takes great care to be as faithful to the world of Spiderman as possible and New York looks amazing, not even Batman's Gotham City bears a flawless harmony of elegance and reality that Raimi has made. Sam's trademark dynamic camera works fits this kind of movie perfectly and every single shot in the movie is full of momentum and a wonder to be hold. Sam's concept for Spiderman is also supported convincingly by some top-notch visual effects and action with Spidy swings though the Manhattan streets with agility and elegance and while some of the CGI is a bit wonky at times, the visual effects in the movie are flawless for the most part while Raimi provides us with plenty of entertaining battle scenes throughout the film, climaxing in a ferocious and grand face-off that's more extreme and primeval than most other action scenes in superhero movies. As with most comic book movies, Spiderman would be nothing without a stellar cast and it certainly delivers that in spades. Toby Maguire is an eye-opener as Spiderman/Peter Parker. Much like Robert Downey Jr. or Hugh Jackman, Maguire absolutely encompasses almost everything needed for Spiderman. He brings a good-heart-ed, timid, compassion to his performance but also skillfully portrays both the geeky side and heroic side of the character with remarkable ease while his enthusiastic looks assure the viewer that he looks like a teen, but even wearing the suit, Maguire exhibits a boyish boldness as well as a bit of innocence but nevertheless is fearless when he battles his foes, clearly Rami and Sony took a risk with Maguire and it pays off wonderfully. Kirsten Dunst is a believable Mary Jane and gives a wonderful performance plus the chemistry between her and Toby seems to ooze off the screen whenever they are together. James Franco is wonderful as Harry Osborn, bringing the character's conflicts with his father and his relationship with Peter to life in a wonderful way. Rosemary Harris is wonderful as Aunt May as is Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben and J.K. Simmons steals every scene he's in as the fiery and grumpy J. Jonah Jameson while on the other side of the coin is Willem Dafoe as the evil Green Goblin/ Norman Osborn. When he is Norman, Dafoe portrays a more fatherly figure to Peter while displaying sighs of what he will later become, but when he becomes insane, Willem fully grasps his madness and goes as over-the-top as one can go and uses a richer voice tone for Norman while using a hoarser voice and psychotic laugh for the Goblin without going too cartoonish but still maintaining a conniving and threatening persona that invokes dread throughout New York, truly one of the finest villains in all of comic book filmdom. If I did have an issue with the film, it would the Green Goblin suit as it does look like something out of Power Rangers, but apart from that, Spiderman is a truly fantastic comic book movie. Definitely one to watch.
6.0~First movie based on a comic book hero that has captured the cheapness and shallowness of the comics. jrphelan Sign in Permalink This is the first movie made from a comic book that that has captured the cheapness and shallowness of comics. For the most part I found the movie boring and shallow and trite. It looked and sounded cheap, like the comics. Amazing that a movie that was so cheaply made (i.e. special effects) could be drawing so many crowds. Must be due to a lack of good summer films. Excellent main characters, good acting talent wasted on comic one dimensional roles. The thrill, flash, and glee in the comic book was left out of the movie. Too bad...
9.0~Spider-Man is alive!!! amanfigo Sign in Permalink This is the best comic book movie ever (with X2)... Sam Raimi does a great adventure/action movie, with a wonderful script with a big special effects and a perfect cast. Sam Raimi's experience, in doing movies, get a movie with a strong narrative, doing that the public don't get bored in all of the movie lenght. The script picks great moments of the comic book like the Spiderman genesis or the final fight between Spidey & GG (a flick of the Green Goblin's Last Stand comic). Regarding many changes about of the original comic (organical webshooters or the new Green Goblin costume), on the contrary that the comic book fans, They don't mind me and I think are good for modernize the movie. About the cast, I have to say that Tobey Maguire is a great actor and is the perfect Spider-Man (Tobey for Spider-Man, is the same that Hugh Jackman for Wolverine or Christopher Reeve for Superman) now I can't see another actor as Spidey if he isn't Tobey, this boy have a great future. Willem Dafoe is a incredible Green Goblin, he is a frightening villain (like Jack Nicholson as the Joker). Kirsten Dunst also is good as MJ (although Mary Jane, in the movie, seems more Gwen Stacy than MJ). And the rest of the principal cast (James Franco, Rosemary Harris, Cliff Robertson and J.K. Simmons) are very good with regard to their roles. The special effects are a great attractiveness of the movie and are incredibly good, when Spidey and GG are CGI is like they were alive... yes, I said GREEN GOBLIN & SPIDER-MAN ARE ALIVE.. THAT'S INCREDIBLE!!! In my opinion, Spider-Man is great movie, and it don't have anything to envy to other movies like Superman, Batman, X-Men or the Crow. 8/10
8.0~Good, but not perfect mjkraft Sign in Permalink The movie was pretty good. Parts of the movie turned into a CGI-fest though and the CGI was very noticeable. If you ignore that and focus on the plot (the origin story followed the comic pretty faithfully) and the characters (I especially liked William Dafoe's portrayal of Norman Osborn) the movie was enjoyable. Toby Maguire made a pretty good Spiderman despite what critics say. The ending seemed a bit rushed and there is an obvious setup for a sequel. Still I enjoyed the movie and may see it again since I missed all the trailers and I heard there is a surprise at the end of the credits.
10.0~Spider-Man takes you for a spin around the block vicster_ Sign in Permalink AMAZING!!! It's been a long time since a good action movie came out, and Spider-Man is that movie that we action fans have been waiting for. Past experiences with comic book heroes were not so great, and only X-Men could sort of be counted as a success. Now Spider-Man bears the crown as one of the best comic book adaptations in the film industry.
9.0~Incredible actor4life Sign in Permalink This movie takes one of the geat comic icons of our time and makes a movie that does it justice. Though I never grew up on comics, I knew who the big ones were, Spider-Man was one of those. Even though I knew little of the comic, I still had a working knowledge of Spider-Man. This is what the movie does, it takes someone who may not know that much of him and educates them in a way that the layperson can understand. This movie speaks to all ages wether you grew up with the original or watched the cartoon. That is what a movie should do.
7.0~Good ride in special effects Enchorde Sign in Permalink ** Here might be a web of spoilers ** Recap: Peter Parker (Maguire) is secretly in love with the girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Dunst). During a school field trip a genetically modified spider bites Peter, and overnight he is changed. He now has superhuman abilities, but has not learned to control them. This proves to be troublesome, for example in school. When a robber then kills his uncle Peter decides to use his abilities to fight crime. However, the general public can't make up its mind if Spiderman is a blessing or a menace. And at the same time the Green Goblin starts to spread terror in the city, making a deadly enemy of Spiderman. When Peter then finds out that Mary Jane dates his best friend Harry (Franco) a really complicated situation arises... Comments: A very nice first installment in this what now seems to become something like a series. Understandable her some focus has to be used to establish the background of Spiderman, stealing some time from the main plot. However with some small episodes the entire story is both easy and fun to follow. Now this is no philosophical movie, or reality based in any way. But it is a entertaining ride in special effects and superhuman abilities spiced up with a little love story. I will not remember it for actor performances, still there are very competent actors in it, especially Dafoe and Dunst. It's their characters that are given most room to develop. Yes, Maguire has the lead and his character does develop much, but most in the way of coping with his new abilities and adjusting to his new role. He does it well, but cannot be measured by the same means as the other characters. But most entertaining, as mentioned, the special effects and the possibilities they allow... 7/10
10.0~Raimi and Maguire weave a magical web in this excellent comic adaptation clydestuff Sign in Permalink Studios lately have been known to spend almost $200 million dollars bringing a comic book super hero to life on the silver screen. With $200 million dollars you can buy many state of the art special effects for the director to full around with to his hearts content. If in the process, though, he decides to fore-go an entertaining story and script, characters that we can get to know and sympathize with, and good actors to bring those characters to life, all the special effects in the world isn't going to amount to a hill of beans. Fortunately for us, in bringing Marvel Comic's Spiderman to life, Sam Raimi did care about those little details and the audience is richly rewarded because of it. One of the trickier tasks when transferring a film such as Spiderman to film is in giving us enough background story. If a writer and director spend too much time on the origins of the character, it has a tendency to bog the rest of the film down. Likewise, if it is given short thrift, we never have a chance to become involved emotionally with the super-hero. In Spiderman, Raimi, aided immeasurably by Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman strikes just the right note. Maguire is such an accomplished actor, that he immediately establishes Peter Parker as someone we will care about throughout the film. He has a crush on the beautiful girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), is constantly harassed by the school jerk, and has a best friend, Harry (James Franco), who's relationship with his father Norman (Willem Dafoe)is far from perfect. As for Peter, he has an exceptional home life with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) which is probably one of the reasons Harry develops an early kinship with him. That and the fact that Harry's father seems to think more of Peter than he does of his own son at times. After having been bitten by a mutated spider, Peter awakens one morning to find himself with some exceptional super powers. He develops muscles that he didn't have before, has reflexes Michael Jordan would be proud of, and can shoot a web like nobody's business. It is during these early scenes of discovery by Peter that the film truly excels. Maguire is like a child whom after taking his first steps, learns he can motor about the house quite nicely, thank you very much. We can't help but have as much fun watching Peter Parker hone his skills as he seems to have in being able to do these magnificent feats. Another fine aspect of Spiderman is the love story that develops between Parker and Mary Jane. As Peter Parker, he is never able to quite overcome his inability to tell Mary Jane of his true feelings. Later, as Spiderman, there is a wonderful scene between him and Mary Jane in a drenching downpour that any romantic film would envy. Whereas some have not been too enamored of Dafoe's portrayal as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, I found both to be right on the mark. As Norman, we see how his continuous drive to control his company alienates and spoils the relationship he has with his son Harry. It's not that Norman is an evil person, his quest for power has led him to more or less take his son for granted. Later, when after a lab accident, it is the schizophrenic battle between the normal Harry and the Evil Harry that brings the Green Goblin to life. It would have been easy for Raimi to have the lab accident just turn Harry instantly into the Green Goblin, but instead we get a richer more dramatic story that we wouldn't have had otherwise. Likewise James Franco, who looks enough like Dafoe that they could be father and son, is a youth who seems tormented by the fact that no matter what success he achieves, his father never gives him his just due. Kirsten Dunst is also beautiful and charming as Mary Jane. Her romantic scenes with Spiderman are wonderfully played, and she has an especially moving scene with Peter Parker as the film draws to a close. As for the special effects, they are indeed spectacular. As Spiderman swoops between buildings on his web, you won't think once that it's not really him doing so. When reading IMDB reviews of this film or any other film that depends heavily on special effects, one must keep in mind that it has become more or less a hobby among some to downgrade the effects of any film so my advice is to just ignore the criticism in that regard. The effects here are fine. Two years ago, it was with quite a bit of eagerness that I anticipated Raimi's Spiderman film and it lived up to my hopes in every aspect. If the impending sequel comes even close to being as good as the original, it'll be a job well done. And if a film such as Spiderman can have me counting the days until Spiderman II, than I have no choice but to give it my grade, which for Spiderman is an A.
7.0~Comic book adaptation is huge fun thanks to Raimi Leofwine_draca Sign in Permalink As much as I am loathe to admit it, CGI effects have been getting better and better in recent years. Not always are they just silly cartoon imagery which looks out of place. And they're mainly responsible for the resurgence in superhero/comic book movies that wouldn't have been possible ten years ago - films like BLADE and X-MEN which rely on CGI effects throughout. SPIDER-MAN is the latest in a long line of comic book heroes being adapted for the big screen, and it isn't half bad. Hardly Sam Raimi's best movie but a thoroughly entertaining popcorn flick which is surprising in that it offers up a fairly adult version of the story with an interesting back story to set up the major characters and an emphasis on character development instead of mindless action. That's not to say the film is without action, but the various set pieces are made to count and not just overdone as they so could easily have been. Most of the elements that make up this film are good rather than brilliant, but the combination is pretty flawless. Obviously the superhero story has been done before but Raimi offers enough originality (along with a few spots of his previous craziness in the zooming skulls and spiders in the first transformations) and vitality into his film to make it feel fresh and exciting. The script is intelligent and offers up strong, likable characters with believable motivations; even the villain is a schizophrenic more to be pitied than hated. The music by Danny Elfman is rather unnoticeable but the film makes up for this with good camera-work and excellently staged scenes of action - the wrestling ring fight, the cliffhanger bridge ending, the carnival disaster are all excellent examples of the fantasy action genre at its finest, offering up explosive thrills and hard-hitting violence. This is a film where the punches count. The CGI effects are blended nicely into the action and for the most part are pretty good, only looking shoddy a couple of times. As for the actors, Tobey Maguire makes a decent and respectable hero and even though his character development from nerdy geek to romantic lead is rather clichéd, he makes a good fist of it - congratulations to the boy. Willem Dafoe is all hamminess in the role of the Green Goblin, the film's hoverboard-riding villain, and is great as always, especially with that infectious laugh of his. Kirsten Dunst gets a fair amount of screen time as the love interest and even though her character is fairly useless at least she looks good in the part. Special mention goes to James Franco as Dafoe's brooding son Harry, who also happens to be Spidey's best mate. Watch out for the parade of cameo appearances which include Raimi cohorts Lucy Lawless as a punk, Bruce Campbell as the overbearing ring announcer, and Ted Raimi as a newspaper man. Probably the most bizarre appearance goes to porn star Robert Kerman as the boat captain - this is of course the same guy who played Professor Monroe in CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. Sadly he doesn't get to say "I wonder who the real Spider-Man is?".
4.0~Mediocre PWNYCNY Sign in Permalink If you like comic book characters who perform acts of superhuman strength, then this movie is for you. Unfortunately, the movie offers little else which warrants commendation. The story is simplistic and superficial, the characters two-dimensional; the acting, with the exception of Willem Dafoe's, is mediocre; and the special effects contrived. Any story involving a human being becoming transformed into a spider-like creature should evoke a sense of terror and horror over such a change, especially when the human knows what is happening. Yet this movie offers none of that. (Compare Spiderman to the Jeff Goldblum character in "The Fly" and you know what I'm referring to.) Instead, the movie remains essentially a comic-book story about a comic-book character. That being the case, why not just read the comic book?
9.0~You and I are not so different. Spikeopath Sign in Permalink Whilst out on a high school museum trip, student Peter Parker is bitten by a genetically enhanced spider. He suddenly finds himself with arachnid like super powers and goes on a crime fighting spree. With a budget of $100 million and a then up coming director in Sam Raimi in the chair, expectations for the first live action film of Spider-Man was extraordinarily high. Thankfully, Raimi and his team succeeded in producing a rip roaring spectacle that doesn't want for human based drama either. Back in 2002 Spider-Man was rightly being lauded as a film that appeased all comers, Raimi fans, comic book geeks and the walk in thrill seeking cinema crowd {the last one is a club i'm proudly a member of} all of which got catered for. Today, after two differing sequels, some of Spider-Man's shine appears to have dimmed, it's almost as if the franchise is judged as a whole, and not for this splendid, and very well crafted piece of fantasy. Which is a shame as Spider-Man doesn't rest on its comic book laurels, that would have been the easy option. Revisiting the film now in this post Dark Knight era, where darkly drawn undercurrents are all the rage, Raimi's Spider-Man is actually a leading light. Having Raimi in charge greatly benefits the piece, because where one could easily have dealt in full blown light entertainment, Raimi and screenwriter David Koep have flecked the fun with shades of dark. Comic book villainy gets a complex make over courtesy of Willem Dafoe's cackling Norman Osborne/Green Goblin splice off, with a mirror sequence fit to grace any head doctor seminar!. And Parker's duality {excellently realised by a well cast Tobey Maguire} alongside his own complex moral quandaries ensures that Spider-Man the movie is not just about bang for the buck shenanigans. Some minor problems do exist, the CGI at times comes off as creaky, and Danny Elfman's score is not up to his usual high standard, but in the main they are really only throw away complaints. To wit the odd quibble about Spider-Man origins and a hokey Green Goblin costume aside, the film is a sure fire winner. Kirsten Dunst eventually warms to the admittedly twee role of love interest Mary Jane Watson, and James Franco serves notice of undoubted ability as Peter Parker's best friend, Harry Osborne. With a humongous budget and a salivating fan base to please, Raimi was entrusted great responsibility. That he crafted such a ripper of a movie, with little shades of dark, is now, to my mind, a towering achievement. 8.5/10
9.0~The Amazing Tobey Maguire! bethlynch91 Sign in Permalink I just saw "Spider-Man" last night! Wow! What a way to start the summer movie season! Tobey Maguire is Spider-Man! The story of Peter Parker's evolution into the human arachnid was told with simple humor and action packed scenes with a beautiful New York City backdrop. Kirsten Dunst has an excellent chemistry with Maguire on screen. If their luscious kiss in the rain-soaked alley doesn't get most sexy kiss next year at the MTV movie awards, I will be very disappointed! Willam Dafoe as Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin was just down right wicked! I've forgotten how good of an actor he can be. He may have even over acted a little, but sometimes the villain has to have a distorted personality in the comic book and the movie screen. James Franco, I can't wait to see how he pulls off being Spidy's arch-nemesis in the next movie. And the guy who plays JJ Jameson, JK Simmons, he's right on the nose playing the obnoxious editor. Can you tell I highly recommend this movie? The few things which urked me: some of the CG effects looked fake, not the fly-through scenes but some of the actual fight scenes. Other than that, this movie is a definitely good way to start the summer season, if you can't wait for "Star Wars." If you're not in it for the sci-fi, Tobey is wonderful eye candy. Well worth the price of admission!
10.0~Perfection. CXtreme2K Sign in Permalink It surpassed all of my greatest expectations. I haven't seen such a good movie since the Scorpion King, and yes, I say the Scorpion King owned. I like that the movie was very loyal to the comic book, it had great music, and it really had a way of making you actually give a damn about the characters. Such as Uncle Ben, or Mary Jane, etc. Simply perfect.
4.0~Suck suck suck spinbunny Sign in Permalink I saw this movie on a free pass....it still was not worth being there for free and being given a free large popcorn and a free large diet coke. It was tortorous and awful...if I was not babysitting and had to stay there I would have been gone within 5 minutes.
8.0~Raimi's Spider-man swings!! badguy-1 Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi has done it! He's created a film based on a comic book that fans and non-fans alike can enjoy. It sticks close enough to the original source material, while introducing some new ideas to the Spider-man mythos. Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast as our favorite wall crawler. He is shy and clumsy as Peter Parker and exuberant as Spidey. The early scenes showing Pete learning how to use his newly acquired abilities are very well done and quite funny. The few scenes with his Uncle Ben are touching. Like Nicholson did when he played the Joker, Willem Dafoe chews up the scenery, the furniture, the props and his fellow actors as the over-the-top Green Goblin. J.K. Simmons is pefect as J. Jonah Jameson. And Kirsten Dunst is good as Mary Jane Watson. The CG effects are just fine, even though I've read other's criticisms that the web-slinging scenes aren't convincing. As far as comic book movies go, I would rate this higher than the recent X-Men and Blade movies, but not quite up to the level of the original Superman movie with Chris Reeve. A solid three stars out of four.
8.0~The almost amazing Spider-Man..... tripper0 Sign in Permalink 'Spider-man' is an extremely entertaining movie. It is well cast, acted and directed. This movie thrives not so much on action, but on characters, which is the ultimate strength of the movie. I am thankful that there is a good deal of dialogue because otherwise this movie would have been a lot less. Tobey Maguire is a perfect Peter Parker. His early relationship(and awkwardness)with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst)is played out to perfection. We get a character we can relate with, in Parker. This is the relationship that drives the movie very well. William Dafoe also plays his duel role to perfection. This is also a credit to Sam Raimi. The Green Goblin is captured beautifully, and the Osborns are portrayed true to the comic book form. The relationship between Harry and Norman is very accurate. Actually, every relationship in this movie is very true to the comic book, and I appreciated that, and they could set up the next movie quite logically. What I didn't like were some of the special effects. I understand that it is near impossible to capture the movements of such a character, and this movie made a very noble attempt. It is obvious, however, when they switch between special effects and the live action actor. The movements of the special effects Spider-man are much to quick, without gravity, and at times, specifically in some fight sequences, a little to bouncy. The same can be said for the Green Goblin. At times though, they are quite stunning. The effects are good, but the best parts of the movie are when the characters interact without the use of the effects. The final showdown is specifically well done, and one of my favorite parts of the movie. Sam Raimi did a hell of a good job directing this movie, and I am looking forward to a sequel. 8 out of 10.
10.0~Outstanding!!! YanKstaSpaZ Sign in Permalink This is easily one my favorite movies of all time...I've never watched a movie and been so excited before and after the movie. The story was wonderful, the action was exciting and the effects were outstanding. I don't remember the last time I saw a movie and got so caught up in it like I have with this. If you want to have a great time go see Spider-Man!
7.0~Spiderman- Slightly flawed but a sound base to build on Ibuk Sign in Permalink First of all let me say that it is always difficult to introduce a Superhero to the big screen and provide a sound base for future sequels to build on. Superman managed it, The Fantastic Four on the other hand didn't. Spiderman is somewhere in between. I preferred No. 2 to Spiderman No.1 because in Spiderman they spent too long explaining the origins of Spiderman, actually this is one minor problem with the first Superman movie. On the other hand I thought the villain in the Spiderman No.1 was far better than the one in Spiderman 2. Williem Dafoe was superb as the Green Goblin, he was terrifying. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst was also superb as Peter Parker and Mary Jane. If the responsibility of bringing the web slinging Superhero had fallen into the wrong hands it could have been a whole lot worse. Not a bad effort at all.
10.0~Great Conversion!! asharpe Sign in Permalink What a delight!! Sam Raimi has excelled himself with wonderful casting and the best comic adaption ever. Probably the finest superhero movie to date. Toby Maguire plays the role of Peter Parker just the way you'd want him to, with not a hint of arrogance that he's landed the role of a lifetime, but someone every bulleyed kid anywhere can relate to and want to be. The gorgeous Kirsten Dunst plays the ultimate girl next door and the under-rated Willem Dafoe is the best baddie since Jim Carrey in Batman Returns. A real treat. Must see!!
9.0~And I thought X-Men was good!!! Libby-K Sign in Permalink The moment I saw X-Men I thought ' Well, that was one of the best comic to movie films I have ever seen, you can't get better than this ' and when I went to see spider-man today I thought back to X-Men and realised that it was nothing compared to Spider-man. Spider-man kept me entertained from start to finish whether it was the humour or the pure excitement I wasn't bored for one second. Tobey Maguire was perfectly cast as the male lead and Kirsten Dunst and William Dafoe were outstanding in their roles. I loved it so much I'm actually going back for the official premier next Friday.
6.0~A hype! POG-2 Sign in Permalink This is one of the films that make you wonder whether news reporting is just another way of advertising. The film was mentioned in the news so often until you just had to see it. So I did. First the good of it: brilliant special effects that I enjoyed and some good jokes, which were partly given away by the trailers however. And when you watch the "famous" kissing scene you only think of the water that allegedly drips into his nose. And now to the bad: The film is very slow-moving and even boring at times. The dialogues are tremendously bad - as if they'd been taken from the comic without any change. The acting is not bad, but with such dialogues even a good actor looks stupid. And I bet like many other Europeans we're getting a bit fed up with all those expressions of American patriotism and those pathetic "big" heroes that Americans seem to love so much. There is no way around the American flag in American films it seems. I liked the X-Men but definitely didn't Spiderman (apart from the good actors and the special effects).
10.0~Exceptional movie mmpitas Sign in Permalink This movie was great, I saw it on opening night with 2 Sam Raimi fans and then 4 days later watched it with my brother who is a big "The Amazing Spider-Man" comic book fan, as am I. We all loved the movie, and I'm not adverse to seeing it again! The plot is clear, the love-story between Peter/Spidey and MJ follows the comic and cartoon almost exactly, and the action scenes are fantastic! This movie is in the same league as Fellowship of the Ring, as far as I'm concerned!
6.0~Great action movie but sadly altered post-9/11 alexthomas Sign in Permalink If you fancy watching a no-brainer, with very little subplot or substance, then this movie is for you. Good quality action sequences and impressive CGI belies the fact that there is nothing else too it really. When combined with the inherent jingoistic aspect, which unfortunately mars a lot of Hollywood flicks, I was a little disappointed with this effort. It is painfully obvious that sequels are going to be forthcoming and many, and that part on the bridge something like ***SPOILER*** "If you hurt one of us New Yorkers, you hurt us all"... O.H. M.Y. G.O.D. did they really need that? Not even close to the first Batman, and maybe I'm expecting more than just a series of action sequences loosely interlinked with a laughable 'love story', but I felt let down.
10.0~Way more than I expected!!! grandmofftarkin Sign in Permalink Growing up as a comic book fan I am always leary about seeing a movie adaption of a beloved comic. I am especially ambivalent about movie adaptions of Marvel comics, as I am a huge Marvel fan. I was pleasantly surprised with Spider-Man. I truly believe Marvel has hit a homerun with this movie. As I believe they hit one with X-Men. If they keep it up they will be to GEN X what DC was to baby boomers. See it! Love it! Most importantly HAVE FUN with it! That's what movies are for! grandmofftarkin: The Movie Lovers Critic
7.0~Great movie!! djfrost-46786 Sign in Permalink Great movie then and today. This was a good Peter Parker. The Green guy reminded me of the Joker. Not only that, the people choice Spiderman over him. Same as the Joker in Batman with the boat to blow up part.
10.0~Just truly AWESOME! collegeguy21 Sign in Permalink Well the whole experience of Spiderman was just awesome. The experience began Friday night in this small town where the 175 seat theater was sold out before I even got in line for the 9:00 show. Then the line was equally long Saturday night 1 hour before the doors opened for the late show again, however I had advanced tickets. It was an amazing sight! The movie was great!! I loved every second. Tobey did a great job as Spiderman and Dafoe was the perfect choice for the crazy Green Goblin. That laugh was simply hilarious to hear! The effects were as expected, some of the best! And naturally the one I just could not wait to see was Kirsten Dunst, who is really showing she is already a great actress. Kirsten did an amazing job in it as she always does, and she looked hot as always too!! I recommend this movie to anyone who is in for top notch thrill ride!
5.0~simply adequate when it should have been great (No spoilers) brendonm Sign in Permalink The first thirty minutes had me smiling, but after the initial setup the movie falls apart and feels very episodic. Why? Because the villain had no plan to carry off, so the hero had no goal to reach. The climax was lame as well -- not enough at stake. The production design was cool, but the lighting overall was flat: it looked like a TV movie. And what was up with all that _graininess_ during some of the CGI-heavy sequences? Were they re-rendering frames up until the last minute? I have other gripes as well, but the overall crime here is that what should have been a great movie turned out to be simply mediocre. The Spiderman I know and love still lives in the 1967 animated TV series. Tobey Maguire, however, was well cast as Peter Parker -- he inhabited the role well as he usually does (rent WONDER BOYS for another great performance of his). And Kirsten Dunst has grown up to be a real hottie.
4.0~maybe it's all the hype that let it down? ditzydramatic Sign in Permalink after all the hype this film got - and boy did it get a LOT!!! - i thought this fiml was gonna be the best of the year. it wasn't. when i think about it, the only reason i actually would waqtch it again is for the rain scene - Kirsten Dunst at one of her best's!!! i wouldn't even recommend this film! sorry!!! (hopefully the 2nd one will be better?)
3.0~If this was a dog I would put it down biaggi1 Sign in Permalink I'm sorry but this movie is one of the worst comic book adaptation's ever to hit the big screen, it makes Batman Forever look good! It concentrates too much on how Spiderman came to be and too much on his emotions. Okay I don't want an all out action movie but this film delved too much into the character's Psyche and is too clever for its own good. The villain is appalling. This movie is for comic book geeks, there is nothing wrong with that but as for the mainstream it is just wrong. Okay it got good reviews and people seem to like it but I feel people's judgements seem to be clouded by the fact that its Spiderman so it 'must be good'. I hear comments such as 'Whoaa Duude the way he swings from one building to another is like totally cool!' well you get the picture! If you have not seen this movie then Don't! watch Spiderman 2 a great improvement and simply an amazing movie, This movie however...well you know the saying 'Life's a bitch sometimes!'? well this is why.
10.0~Let's do this... dscronox Sign in Permalink This film, for lack of a better word, was amazing. The cast was well put together, the CGI scenes were clean and believable and the actin sequences were excellent. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and Willem Dafoe were excellent in their roles. Sam Raimi's direction was beautiful and the special effects were excellent. I can't wait for the sequel next year. I give this movie ten out of ten. If you haven't seen it, got do so, now.
10.0~Amazing. mkmark01 Sign in Permalink I've seen it three times and it continues to give me chills. Not only was the casting perfect and the story excellent, but it made me feel 6 years old again - not an easy task. I am in love with this movie, as should any other Spidey fan out there. Great job Sam, Tobey, Kirsten, Willem, etc - I can't WAIT for the sequel!
9.0~Action is his reward. Yours is the best superhero movie since "Batman" (the Tim Burton one - sorry, but the 1966 one sucked). Victor Field Sign in Permalink Warning: This features the odd spoiler. "Spider-Man," as Peter Parker tells us at the start of the movie (and can I just say that, technically accurate though it may be, I hate the hyphen?), is basically a story about a girl. But that's not a reason to put people off (apart from the many people who think they're the only people in the world not to like this movie... and you aren't, okay? You aren't) - the Wall-Crawler was always more approachable than most of his breed, and the human element is one of the many reasons why Sam Raimi's movie is up there with the better examples of the genre ("X-Men," the first Tim Burton "Batman" movie, the first two "Superman" movies); it hits the ground running and keeps going throughout the two hours, with such a fine mixture of love story, origins tale and action that I've now forgiven David Koepp for writing "The Shadow" and "The Lost World: Jurassic Park." How-it-all-began movies can play like pilots, but this one never feels like television, which is a blessing given how Spiderman (hang the hyphen, this is MY review) hasn't come off too well on the small screen, especially in the live-action attempts (anyone remember "The Electric Company"?). As played by the engaging Tobey Maguire, we're on Peter Parker's side from the moment we see the nerdy student getting mocked by his fellows; we feel his joy on discovering his superpowers (note that he never refers to his Spider-sense tingling); and we feel his sorrow when his uncle dies, a death he could have prevented. Though a chestnut-haired Kirsten Dunst doesn't look too much like Mary Jane Watson, she's charming and appealing even if she really doesn't have that much to do apart from be rescued and act as the love interest - much like Frances McDormand in Raimi's last (and also good) take on hero flicks, "Darkman." WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR SPOILERS... The resemblance doesn't end there; "Spider-Man" and "Darkman" both end with the hero knowing his beloved can return his love but choosing to live the life that fate ordained for him, over what his heart feels. Granted, "Spider-Man"'s ending isn't as all-out sad as "Darkman"'s (Frances McDormand frantically searching the streets of New York for Liam Neeson, who now has the face of Bruce Campbell), but it does leave the possibility of a reunion, and there's also a touch of ambiguity in that it leaves open the question of whether or not she knows his secret identity... in the climax Spidey calls her "MJ," even though she's never told him her name whenever they met while he was in webslinging mode. Very well acted, and very touching. (And I didn't mind the American flag either.) WE NOW RETURN TO OUR SPOILER-FREE SECTION, STILL IN PROGRESS. "Spider-Man" has flaws, of course, mainly its villain the Green Goblin and his altar ego (and father of Peter's best friend) Norman Osborn. He's not developed quite as well as his opponent, and as good as most of Willem Dafoe's performance is, some of his attempts at being a tortured soul are uncomfortably reminiscent of Jack Lord getting all emotional on "Hawaii Five-O." Then again, we've had the villain be infinitely more exciting than the hero far, far too many times. The effects from Sony Pictures Imageworks, Digiscope et al are uneven and sometimes unconvincing, and I'm not entirely sure about the Green Goblin's costume, but the human stuff always works (humorous and moving by turns), and since the webbing here looks like webbing and not rope (see the 1970s show), why gripe? The final faceoff between hero and villain is a bit underpowered, with the real action climax on a bridge coming just before the two go one-on-one - and it's certainly less striking than the movie's final scenes, but the cards have been laid out clearly by then; it's less about a superhero than about a man, and though it has plenty of action, escapes, rescues etc., that's how it should be. Your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man's finally made a successful leap out of the comics. Bonus points for J.K. Simmons (wonderful but underused as J. Jonah Jameson - never mind, there's always the sequel) and the cameos from Lucy Lawless, Ted Raimi, Bruce Campbell and Kirsten Dunst's rain-soaked breasts (extra treat #1); I wish that Columbia had taken a page from "X-Men"'s book and devoted the end credits to Danny Elfman's score instead of forgettable nu-metal, however. (Even there, they redeem themselves with the theme from the cartoon at the very end of the credits - the ORIGINAL one (extra treat #2), not the version from Aerosmith on the song album! All together now - "Spiderman, Spiderman/Does whatever a spider can/Spins a web, any size/Catches thieves, just like flies/Look out, here comes the Spiderman...")
9.0~The first superhero film I saw that blew my mind joetufano882 Sign in Permalink Spider-Man (2002) is a movie that has stayed in my imagination for a long time, and this movie along with the sequel Spider-Man 2 has become of my all time favorites over the years. Before, I never really cared much for comic books or superheroes except for Batman with the Joel Schumacher Batman flicks which... well, you know. My feelings beforehand on the film before it's release, "Looks fun, but nothing THAT special". Boy was I wrong because I was in complete awe as I watched it in the theater with my Dad. I loved it then, I still do today even though I do recognize it has some flaws but I give this movie a lot of credit though for (along with X-Men) for reviving the comic book movie genre, and for getting me into the idea of superheroes in general. I know a lot of people don't like Tobey Maguire anymore because of the Emo Peter sequence in Spider-Man 3, but I've always thought he was great in the role of Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Having read the comics, I will say that in a lot of ways he encompasses the traits of the classic Peter Parker. He's shy, timid, intelligent but also caring of the people in his life. Within the first 10 minutes of the film, he's established as the school nerd who isn't with the crowd, has Harry Osborn who is his only friend and goes unnoticed by Mary Jane Watson whom he's been in love with since childhood. And you do feel for him as a character and understand his progression as we see his progression from hapless nerd to cocksure fool, to humbled hero after the tragedy of Uncle Ben's death. Call me crazy but I think Tobey did a great job of capturing those qualities and I think he did a great job as Spidey also successfully encompassing the heroic nature of the character with a touch of Spidey's humor here and there. Kirsten Dunst I don't feel is THE best Mary Jane ever, but I've always appreciated her portrayal of the character. Yes the damsel in distress act gets annoying after awhile but like with Peter, you see her character change throughout as she decides what kind of man she wants in her life, and she had some depth to her as far as her home life with her parents. James Franco does commendable work as Harry Osborn and I love the hint of him becoming the villain in the future. Cliff Robertson (RIP) and Rosemary Harris are terrific in the roles of Uncle Ben and Aunt May and the scene where Uncle Ben dies makes me tear up every time. Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin is perfect. Even though his character comes off as evil for evil's sake, he does bring a human element to the role since he favors Peter over his own son Harry. And yes the Goblin costume does look stupid, but I like it anyway. And JK Simmons is PERFECT as J. Jonah Jameson... Nuff' said! Along with Sam Raimi's direction, David Koepp's screenplay play a huge part with these characters and they both succeed in giving us likable characters that we can connect with. The score by Danny Elfman speaks the character so well, the effects while some of it looks a bit dated still hold up today, the humor (while it goes overboard at points) is also great, and Sam Raimi's style I think is very suitable for Spider-Man given that the film is very colorful with characters, the tone and the music. It even feels like your watching a comic book come to life. The action is also masterfully executed. Sam Raimi I feel is a master of directing action/suspense since he uses a mix of practical stunt work and CGI. The final fight between the Goblin and Spidey is a showcase in this film for his skills of directing fight scenes. And I absolutely LOVE the final sequence of Spider-Man swinging through the city after he gives the "my gift, my curse" monologue with Elfman's theme blaring in the background. And I know some people have problems with some of the changes made to the character as far as MJ coming before Gwen Stacy and the organic webbing. Personally I never had a problem with these changes because you can't adapt every single thing from the source material, and every creative mind is going to have his/her own spin on the story. The organic webs I felt were more believable than the idea of a high school student having the 3 million dollars or so to create the mechanical web shooters, and also given that he was bitten by a genetically engineered spider, why not? Regardless of how people feel about this movie now that the reboot is out, I've always loved this film and always will even though I like the 2nd one better. It's got well realized/likable characters, fun action, a truly amazing score, and a tone that perfectly captures everything that Spider-Man's all about.
8.0~At last a good one duefiori Sign in Permalink Whew, at last! I have been waiting AGES for this, probably since i was a teen... finally they managed to make a good movie conversion of my oh-so-loved Marvel superhero comics (DC managed long ago with some - not all - of the Batman's and Superman's). I am so glad and so relieved they did not mess with this... Just a couple of minor notes (which are very minor spoilers for everyone not knowing the comics but commonplace for who does). 1) A bit of liberty taken with side characters (aunt May should be skinnier, MJ at college was the "liberated 70" type - and Gwen's tragedy would have added depth to the character). 2) A quick hint to a "Dr. Connors" who fires Peter should have been taken away or deepened (are we talking lizards here? hint hint). 3) The final scenes are a wee bit too cheesy and a wee bit too wooden. No full marks then, but hey - a well deserved 8/10.
10.0~wow spamule Sign in Permalink This movie was for real. No this wasn't a "shoot 'em up, action movie," though it had some of that. It starts off with a dork of a high schooler -- someone you know existed in your high school -- and ends up with a superhero who knows what he has to do. As they say, "with great power comes great responsibility." Peter Parker starts as a genius with no social life. His love is for one of the most popular girls in school and he has only one friend who happens to be incredibly rich. This movie touches on adolescent love, changes, and the more foreign experience of having amazing abilities over the rest of us. Tobey Maguire does a good job as Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst is clearly the beautiful Mary Jane and James Franco plays Harry Osborn, the son of a very wealthy Norman Osborn. Willem Dafoe does an excellent job of playing the successful businessman, yet tortured, supervillain. Simply put, this movie has realistic interactions amongst its characters, and shows the arrival of a superhero. It is a great film.
8.0~Web slingers unite Tyson14 Sign in Permalink After 25 years in development hell, Sam Raimi(The Evil Dead, Darkman) and Columbia Pictures brought Spiderman to the big screen in the Spring of 2002. The film does justice to Marvel's Spiderman comic books and it's fun to watch even if you've never read a comic book. Tobey MacGuire plays Peter Parker and his alter ego Spiderman. During a field trip, a radioactive spider escapes from its cage and it bites Parker on the hand! The spider bite gives him superpowers such as a "Spideysense" and the ability to shoot webs. In the comic book, Peter uses "prosthetic web shooters". In the Spiderman movies, the web shooters are organic. Peter Parker has a crush on Mary Jane(Kirsten Dunst), a redheaded girl who goes to the same high school. After Peter's uncle Ben Parker(Cliff Robertson) is killed by a mugger, Peter fights crime as Spiderman. Spiderman has to help people as the malevolent, psychotic, power-hungry Green Goblin(Willem Dafoe) kills people in New York. TV's Spiderman and his Amazing Friends(1982) and a Spiderman T-shirt that I wore in 1985 were my first exposure to Spiderman. Although, Spiderman has been around since the 1960's. A live action Spiderman movie project was passed around from studio to studio. Cannon Films had the Spiderman filmmaking rights at one time. At one time, James Cameron was going to direct the film. A movie poster and a movie trailer with the World Trade Center was used to promote the Spiderman movie in 2001. Both disappeared after the Terrorist Attack on September 11th, 2001. Spiderman(2002) is jam-packed with patriotism and flag-waving. The visual effects in Spiderman have been criticized for looking rubbery and cartoonish, but they get the job done. The visual effects in Spiderman 2(2004) and Spiderman 3(2007) make it up to us by having eye-popping, glossy visual effects. The late "Macho Man" Randy Savage plays a wrestler that Peter Parker fights in an arena. Lucy Lawless, Bruce Campbell, and director Sam Raimi make cameos in the film. Tobey Maguire an inspired choice for Peter Parker/Spiderman. He has to be mild-mannered, strong, and good-looking at the same time. Kirsten Dunst i hate as Mary Jane there's no chemistry between her and Tobey but the upside down kissing scene is a classic. James Franco is quite good as Peter's friend, Harry Osborne. Willem Dafoe plays Norman Osborne and the Green Goblin. Rosemary Harris plays Aunt May and J.K. Simmons plays Daily Bugle chief J. Jonah Jameson. Danny Elfman's Spiderman music score is good. Spiderman was spoofed on The Simpsons and the "Weird Al" Yankovic song 'Ode to a Superhero'. John Dykstra(Star Wars, Batman Forever) crafted the visual effects for Spiderman(2002).
8.0~Nicely Done Maisa1111 Sign in Permalink I thought this was a very good adaptation of a comic book. Comic book fans will be disgruntled about some changes (minor & major), but hey, it's Hollywood, some things had to change. The casting was great, Jameson was my favorite bit of casting, absolutely perfect. The pace was a bit slow in a few places, but nothing too major. The early scenes with Peter Parker learning to become Spider-Man were the best. A little bit campy at times, but a fun, enjoyable movie.
9.0~Best Movie Made from a Comic Book deepeddy Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi's version of Spiderman beats out all of the other comic book movies. It is the perfect blend of action, humor, and romance. The unrequited love Peter Parker has for M.J. and the story of a teenager finding his way in life thoroughly balances out the exciting battles Spiderman has with the Green Goblin. Well done!
8.0~Plenty to enjoy from shaid Sign in Permalink *May contain spoiler* *May contain spoilers* There are a lot of examples from the past for a successful adaptation of comic books(Batman 1 & 2, Superman 1 and The X-Man). There are also examples for very bad adaptations(Batman 3 & 4 and Superman 2,3 &4). I am quite happy to say that Spider-Man belong to the better side of adaptation. The script is good and give basis to the characters and for future installment. The idea to make an analogy between Parker's growing power and him becoming an adult work well and is handled intelligently. The pace is good and fast and there is some humor that works well. Tobey MaGuire's Peter Parker/Spider-Man is spot on. He has that something that make us believing what is going om with him. Kirsten Dunst is good though her character is less complex and remain a little bit flat. Willem Dafoe, to my taste, is lacking the menace that his character demands. But that is my taste and in general he does a good job. I did have 2 problems with the film: 1. The effects of Spider-Man flying through the streets has been done completely by computer and it shows. The computer has problem of imitating a natural human movement and you see it in any move that Spider-Man does. 2. The script,though good, has holes in it. An example for that can be seen in M.J. declaration of love to Peter Parker towards the end of the film. It comes from nowhere. Suddenly, out of nowhere, she declares her love to him. There are several examples for that and that is a shame. It is good, entertaining and relatively short(only 2 hours run)which is a blessing. Go see it. It worth every Euro/Dollar you will spend on it.
10.0~My spidey sense is tingling Newsense Sign in Permalink I remember when this movie first came out I was somewhat skeptical about seeing it but I finally gave in and was surprised of how good it was and how faithful it was to the comic book. The story itself is basically how Spider-man came to be. On a field trip Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) gets bit by a radioactive spider and gains powers from the bite. He not only has to struggle with making ends meet he has to struggle with a destructive lunatic called Green Goblin(Willem Dafoe)and also revealing his true feelings about his long-time friend, Mary Jane(Kirsten Dunst). This movie is so true to the comic book, its almost eerie. Tobey Maguire is great as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Willem Dafoe is excellent as The Green Goblin, J.K. Simmons is great as Jonah Jameson and even Aunt May and Uncle Ben are portrayed and acted accurately. The action sequences are pretty good and even though they use CGI its not an eyesore here as it is in other movies that use it heavily. My only gripe is I could do without the weak one-liners that appear once and awhile in the movie. All in all fans of the comic book as well as the cartoon series wont be disappointed.
4.0~This movie was.... TheShowstopper Sign in Permalink If you want to go to the movies and enjoy a poor storyline, cartoonish CGI graphics, some bad acting, terrible one liners, a washed up wrestler and some sad fight scenes then by all means go see Spider Man. This movie to me was so boring. The only part I did enjoy was Spider Man getting beat up at the end. They totally overhyped this movie and made it out to be something it wasnt...ENJOYABLE!
10.0~My apologies to Tobey MaGuire, Sam Raimi and Williem Dafoe... Counter-Strike Sign in Permalink I'm 30 this year and have been a Spider-Man fan since I was 7. When I first heard that Spider-Man was going to be made into a movie, I was really excited! I mean, come on, reports were that James Cameron was going to write and direct the movie, with Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dr. Octopus! Mouth-watering to say the least! Then came the bombshell - Sam Raimi's gonna direct, Tobey MaGuire's gonna be Spidey and Williem Dafoe's gonna be the Green Goblin. Wow...whoopie-doo, I thought...Sam Raimi...didn't I see his name amongst the credits for shows like Hercules and Xena? Oh boy...Tobey MaGuire? Man, isn't he a little..erm..small for the role? And Williem Dafoe...he's no biggie like Arnie! Great, down the drain I thought... Saw the movie yesterday and BOY, WAS I WRONG about everything! Tobey's a GREAT Peter Parker just as Williem Dafoe's a GREAT Green Goblin. In fact, the entire cast was perfect - from Kirsten Dunst as MJ to JK Simmons as J Jonah Jameson (the only downer was Bill Nunn as Robbie Robertson - Robbie's not supposed to be fat!!). And what can I say about Sam Raimi's direction? It was EXCELLENT! He managed to find a balance between action and telling a human story (the latter being the heart of Spidey). Misgivings about the CGI were unfounded as I found it to be satisfactory after some nifty editing job. The movie has won new fans for Spidey and for an old-timer like me, reinforced my commitment to the web-slinging hero. Most of all, it has made me a fan of Sam Raimi, Tobey MaGuire, Williem Dafoe and Kirsten Dunst. Now things would be perfect if Marvel puts in as much quality work into the Spider-Man comic book series, which have seen some really crappy story-lines (the clone saga and maximum carnage series - they sucked!). I'm going to watch the movie again next week and perhaps again the week after. It gets a perfect 10 rating from me and I'd recommend the movie to all who haven't watched it yet. Final comments, I think the organic web depicted in the movie is GREAT! It makes much more sense than the comic book where Peter Parker gets his webs from web-shooters (I mean, come on, he gets a spider sense and the ability to scale walls like a spider but he doesn't spin web naturally like a spider?) Ideas for sequels - Warren Miles the Jackal and the original cloning story-line (examining the cloning issue that's relevant for us today); Dr. Octopus and his romance with Aunt May (dealing with the issue of trust and finding a new partner). And how about this for mind-blowing - Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Tobey MaGuire as Spider-Man in a Marvel team-up against Dwayne Johnson (aka the Rock) as The Juggernaut? Excelsior!
10.0~Excellent kelbowski Sign in Permalink It was as good if not better than I expected it to be.I just got home from watching it a few hours ago and I'm still blown away.It is worth watching that's for sure!!!I am really looking forward to Spiderman 2.I only hope It is half as good as the first. We will see:)
10.0~More than worth the price of admission tmiles81 Sign in Permalink This was a great origin and comic book adaptation. Marvel did an excellent job on Blade I and thought they could not outdue themselves, but I stand corrected. In the words of Stan "The Man" Lee, Excelsior!!!!
1.0~A great movie!! Monty Burns Sign in Permalink I'm in shock. Raimi has pulled it off. Tobey is Spider-Man. The story is well written. The effects are perfect. The score is a 10. Finally a comic book movie that holds its own to Tim Burton's Batman. Could this movie get any better!? I think not. Way to go Raimi!
8.0~Not as good as it's Sequels dawasu-796-211414 Sign in Permalink When this movie came out I was 7,my family went to see it but I was at a birthday party at the time. They liked it and I was a Spidey fan so we rented it afterwards. At first,I thought it had too much Green Goblin in it and not enough Spiderman but then I watched it when I was older and I rejected that thought. This movie is very good! Lots of good fight scenes, good acting and humour r. I thought the upside down kiss with Mary Jane was an excellent idea. But,I do think that there is too many frightening scenes for kids. For example: when there is that flash ,Green Goblin breaks into Aunt May's house,Green Goblin breaks into Daily Bugle.What I thought was better about 2 and 3 is that they had more humour,more action and more romance. Also the sequels don't have as many frightening scenes as this one. As a movie it's great but I like 2 and 3 better. I give it and 8/10.
10.0~Spinning a web of success horrordude_666 Sign in Permalink This movie has been a great thrill for all of us. It was just a great movie that fans all over have been waiting to see. It's about a high school student named Peter Parker who is a big nerd. But on day he is bit by a super spider and is transformed into Spiderman. But after the death of his uncle, he has devoted his life to saving people. But now he has a super villain on his tail who goes after his aunt and the girl he loves named Mary Jane. Now he must stop the Hobgoblin before he destroys everyone he loves. Who is he? He's Spiderman
9.0~As good as the old Spiderman comics jwpon Sign in Permalink I'd been waiting with gradually increasing expectations for Spiderman. I am glad to say that I was not disappointed. Very little was lost in the translation from the comic book to the movie. Just enough time was spent describing Spiderman's origin. Toby Maguire did an excellent job as the nerdy Peter Parker. Watching Peter discover his powers was a lot of fun. And his tragic discovery about the best use of great power was very moving. Willem Dafoe was an excellent Green Goblin. His conversations in the mirror were terrific and he was a very convincing Goblin. Great climactic battle, little sad about the final Peter Parker scene. Overall a great movie - I'm giving it a '9'.
9.0~Spiderrific! eaglebtc00 Sign in Permalink I thoroughly enjoyed this film! This is the best film based on a comic strip character since Batman and Superman! I was really anticipating it since the delays caused by the fall of the Twin Towers (which required some editing in the film, since they were prominently featured in some "swinging" shots and in the first trailer). I must say the wait was worth it, but I would not have minded seeing the towers. In fact, the WTC towers were used to catch some baddies in a helicopter (in the trailer) so I don't see how that is so devastating to the families and friends in NYC. Overall, this film was excellent! Character development is good throughout. I would like to have seen Spidey do something about M-J's abusive parents, but that would require a whole new (sub-)subplot. I could tell in a few spots where some computer graphics work was done--for example, in the beginning of the film, Peter is leaping from rooftop to rooftop. Here, the shadow looks *good* but still a little suspect. It's fairly obvious they used a blue/green screen for this segment, especially when he leaps higher, closest to the camera's POV. A few of the medical / scientific terms and explanations in the beginning of the film were slightly awkward (and possibly incorrect?) Another thing; what about Willem Dafoe talking to the mirror? His real-life jaw is moving, though the mirror image is talking to him, and not the other way around. Does he have split-personality? Is he schizophrenic? I wasn't quite sure if it was just voices/hallucinations, or a willful split-pers disorder. They did say the green goblin formula would make the test subject insane, so I guess that covers it sufficiently. GO SPIDEY!
3.0~Good actors, bad movie charbel Sign in Permalink This is yet another disappointing adaptation of comic book figures to the big screen. While the casting is excellent, and the actors do a great job with what they have, it's still disappointing. Direction isn't tight enough, and the pace is awkward: slow at times, and way too fast at other. One of the most serious problems with the movie is that it's never exciting, there is no suspense, which is sort of the central point in an adventure flick. To sum things up: put your money on something else, like renting good comic book character movies like Batman or even X-Men.
1.0~Bad dsk2293 Sign in Permalink I'm not sure why people like this movie so much, since it has got nothing special that makes it worth watching. Unless you're a fan of the comic of course (which I am not). I've never read Marvel or other superhero comics and I never will, but I can still enjoy movies like X-men and the first Batman because they have interesting characters and stories. This one however comes with no surprises and extremely flat characters (the geek with superpowers, the stupid but pretty girl that needs to be saved, the evil inventor etc). It just feels like it has been done before a million times. And the CG effects... man, movies like these makes me wish they never invented the computer at all. I'll never watch Spiderman 2...
10.0~Fun fun fun!!! Matrixgirl04K10 Sign in Permalink I went and saw Spider-Man opening day, at 4:00. I took five of my friends with me. And every single one of us left the theater after the show was over grinning and talking about how cool and good that movie was. It was excellent. I'm not a Marvel comic person, heck, I've never even read the original comic book. But I liked it all the same. Amazing graphics, and the HobGoblin had the most fascinating twist in his character. Go see it and see it soon. It's a great action movie.
9.0~So Awesome! HHHVixen Sign in Permalink I went and seen Spiderman tonight and thought it was great. The acting was awesome especially Willem's and Tobey's. The story was great and i thought it didn't drag for a moment. When i left the theater i was like that went way too fast. The action was great especially the fighting scenes. Even though at some parts you could tell it was CGI it didn't take away from the movie. The Ending was great leaving the door open for many sequels. I totally recommend this movie. Everyone clapped at the ending scene between Mary Jane and Peter and then after the movie everyone applauded and was hyped. Go SEE THIS MOVIE! AWESOME!
10.0~A movie that does what it set out to do kujo869 Sign in Permalink This movie is one of the best examples of what a comic book adapation should be. The use of sometimes comic color and style, you get the feeling that a comic book has been breathed life and given a mind of it's own. Some would say that they would not like the performances of the actors, but I feel that the actors depict the character that they have to work with. Toby Mcguire is the quint essenctial nerd gone super hero. Kirsten Dunst comes out as the increiblely sexy, but I am a good girl, girl next door. Htis movie screams comic book and sequel. The only concern of this movie goer is the sequel to this movie being contrived and rushed simply becaue of the success of it's predesessor.
10.0~First Action Classic of the 21st Century 11/10 Simon-109 Sign in Permalink Having never been a big Spiderman fan, I went to see this movie for the pure enjoyment of attending a Sam Raimi movie. Hoping that Mr. Raimi would go back to his roots and would be kind enough to deliver one of his amazing production (and apprehensive of course, after The Gift and that baseball flick he also did and also after the assumption that his hands would be somehow tied after being confided with such a high budget). Boy, where my expectations to be blasted throughout the movie theater! Haven't had such a good time in a movie in years. This was Sam Rami at his best and Spidey can count me among is many fans from now on. Everything was right in this movie and many many things were excellent. Way to go Sam!!! I believe that my fellow movie watcher somehow agree with this appreciation since at the end of the movie most of the audience broke in a solid applause. And this is South Beach, Florida I am talking about, where is not exactly cool to applaud anything or anyone, and hardly anyone stays for the final credits. Kudos to Raimi, Maguire (I hope that the franchise will hold to him for as long as it lasts) and the lovely Dunst. I am going to see it again tonight! ...and then again. $114 million in an opening weekend, Amazing! What a tough act to follow for The Attack of the Clones. Spiderman is already the first action classic of this century.
9.0~I LOVE THIS FILM hfreinoso Sign in Permalink The film was fantastic. I grew up with this and to me this is the film I always loved Tobey Maguire was magnificent in the film. And Ilove this film up to date this film will never get old. 9/10
10.0~The movie that got me into superhero movies. cinephile-27690 Sign in Permalink I like some superhero movies, but it's hard for me to love them. I have a few favorites(Spider Man 2 is my favorite thanks to Roger Ebert), but I have a tendency to not be thrilled by them. I like Tim Burton's Batman movies and Spider Man: Homecoming for instance, but I feel that overall are rather empty. Either the story is undermined and the action is overdone or I don't feel that the action is done right. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, for example, has many flaws and too much action in the last half hour. Because of this, I have only seen a handful of superhero movies. This was actually the first PG-13 movie I ever saw(At about 7), but I left it for many years and re-visited it when I was 19, nearly 2 years ago. As I got older, I could actually appreciate what Sam Raimi did with Spider Man's origin story. It takes about half the movie for Spider Man to show up, and until then we get to know Peter Pan as a human: a bullied nerd, close to his aunt and uncle, in love with his next door neighbor, etc. Even with spider powers, he is still a kid. That's one thing I enjoy about this movie, and especially the 2nd one. Sam Raimi takes a cartoony character and fleshes him out to make him relate-able. The action is exciting as well, since it comes in when it is necessary and it's not over-blown. There's nothing about the acting I can't complain about as well. Tobey Maguire is a great Spider-Man. He's fine in Sea biscuit and The Great Gatsby, but he's great in this. Willem Defoe is fantastic as The Green Goblin, a Mr. Hyde type character that becomes Spider Man's nemesis. That's his best role since Jesus in The Last Temptation of Christ. Of course there are also the actresses Rosemary Harris and Kristen Dunst, and a young James Franco as well. What Spider Man therefore delivers is a fun plot, good action scenes and great acting performances, all balanced very well. The sequel is better, but this is still an excellent origin story.
4.0~Entertaining for 2002 lythis-love Sign in Permalink I never had the Chance to watch the whole movie. Just bits of it, now Netflix gave me the Chance and I sat it out. I really enjoyed the Film although I knew the whole Plot. Of course there were gaping holes in the plot, the acting was shallow the conversation predictable and the graphics made me feel like I watch cut Scenes from a Videogame. Still I liked the Idea and the first half was very good and promising. Until MJ got in Trouble the umpteenthed time and we had to endure Kirstens vocal skills. The time she was on Screen was more a Screamtime than a Screentime. As a role MJ portrayed such a dependent, weak and stupid women it made me angry. Her Friendship and so called "love" also made me doubt her character. First she was with this High School Bully an inlove. Clearly showing she doesn't want to be with him but seemed to weak to end it all. Then Harry Ossborne had a go with her. Meanwhile she falls in love with Spidermann, kisses him even! Peter Parkers love for her was so dramatically all over the film, an how he could never reach her, she would be to perfect for him, got friendzoned like five times and still worships her. Having said that, the end pained me so much a brainfreeze kicked in although I haven't eaten Ice Cream for months. On Norman Ossbornes Funeral MJ confesses her love and he turned her down? What utter nonsense. I liked William Dafoe in his role as the Green Goblin. His Gollumlike Split Action was really well done, he has some really amazing skills for portraying mad People. Sure his Mask and the suit looked out of Fashion... but I rather have real People and real suits instead of all the CGI when superheroes are animated from toe to head. Lets stay with the suits: how come the goblin fires his pumpkin bombs everyones reduced to ashes but Spidy, getting thrown one full in the face, he only gets a scratch? All in all, Spider-Man is a classic. Also with stonefaced Tobey Meguire, it shouldn't be missed out. Most classic of all that this movies has so many up to date memes in it, please give it go!
9.0~Excellent handling of what could have been a disaster... jb witchdance Sign in Permalink By far among the two or three best films the genre has ever produced. It was entertaining throughout, and the action - while visually innovative - was campy enough to allow fans of the old mag to reminisce a bit as the scenes played out. Just sitting there, I could picture the old tattered mags I carried around as a kid, what each scene looked like in print... all that was missing was the yellow box in the corner with "MEANWHILE..." carefully scrawled inside. Sure, they fiddled with a couple details here and there, but you got the sense that it was strictly in an effort to modernize the story. The plot had just the right pace to it, and character development was based on dialogue and decision - meaning that Raimi has the license to go full-throttle in the next installment. Just like you'd have to see the original Star Wars to appreciate the change-of-pace in Empire Strikes Back, the same goes here. I would recommend this film to anybody, in anticipation that the sequel(s) will be ungodly.
9.0~Comic relief clarence279 Sign in Permalink Spiderman may go down as the most refreshing movie of the last decade. Refreshing amidst the three Batman debocles as well as countless summer big-budget disgraces. Attempting not to win the top honors at the Sundance, Spiderman manages to take an icon that is worshipped within a certain domain (those who follow comic books) and lets it flow to anyone who would give it an eye. Director Raimi sticks soundly enough to the original story not to offend the loyal while at the same time allowing notions of a more popular culture to intervene without blurring the purpose of the film. The action sequences are superb, computer-aided and not, and while the characters may not be unforgettable, they certainly all work on the same page, which is a true rarity in film today.
7.0~there is always ' hope for the best' in the next dblaine316 Sign in Permalink Finally I now accept the facts as they are now that I've seen the movie, what 10-15 times. The movie is big CRAP. When I saw the trailer of Spidey 1 I was so overwhelmed that my favourite comic hero was finally coming to big screen. But after watching the movie I actually changed by favourite comic hero from spidey to batman. The movie is very good, cool to watch FOR A 5-year old, stupid CGI with stupid dialogues. The only thing I like was JJ'a acting. Peter is good with his of-the-hand character. But as soon as he puts his mask on begins CGI Maguire. Peter when he puts his mask on grows, what 1 foot longer ? And what lame running in the balloon scene. Peppy. Oh and the villain. Uncle Ben would have played a better villain than the masked marauder. In the comics the villain becomes a monster but in the movie he just remains the same ! Oh but in this movie I am happy that they chose to make him that way because with this type of stupid CGI he would have made another of those Hulk thingies. But the worst part of the film are the fights. Booorrriiinnnngg. Not one fight did I like and everytime a fight begins the audience with which I was in the theatre started booing after the second half. How could they just do so ? So injust. And they totally changed the beginning from the original comic. Peter actually meets Doc Ock in the first part .But where was he . O yeah in the second one. Now where will they incorporate HIM ? Everytime I watched the movie I hoped that its sequel would alter Spidey's future. But low. After watching the trailer I realised one thing. 99% will be boring stupid and filthy CGI .And for those who are able to recognise it will be another one in the basket, the waste basket. Well we'll just hope for the best, and pray they follow atleast some part of the original comics, shall we ?
9.0~The little teen superhero that could freakezette Sign in Permalink Yes, I am a comic geek. I go to my local comic shop every week and buy anywhere from one to 5 comics (My absolute favorite being Ultimate Spiderman, which you guys should check out whether you liked the movie or not). I know that the genre of comic book movies is a risky genre. For every successful comic movie there are many more failed movies, unreadable scripts, and mindless sequels. When I saw the first Spiderman trailer (The WTC web thing) I was very worried that Spiderman was going down the road of the last Batman movie. Tobey Maguire as Spiderman? I saw more trailers, started to become more interested, and soon I was dying to see this movie. It's definitely worse to really want to see a movie than to not be that interested in it, cause then you'll be set up for disappointment (Pearl Harbor, Final Fantasy and Lord of the Rings comes to mind for me). So I go and see it, and I was shocked. Yeah, some dialogue is super cheesy, and yes, the CGI isn't that great. But this movie is what so many other puffed up so-called "Summer Blockbusters" aren't; it's fun. Tobey turned out to be the perfect Peter Parker, and the rest of the cast was right on. For me it was like stepping right into a comic book. It's colorful, larger than life, pure fun. My non-comic type friends loved it too. And considering how it is doing so much better than anyone could of dreamed off, I would love to see it beat Star Wars this summer. Probably won't, but then again anything is possible. 9/10, a giant step forward in the comic book movie genre.
8.0~Fun Movie. lschmalz Sign in Permalink Now here's a very fun, action-packed and enjoyable flick, start to finish. Based on the Marvel comic by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, "Spider-Man" spins the tale of geeky high schooler, Peter Parker (sweetly played by Maguire) who is bitten by a rare species of spider, and becomes the titled action hero. He sets out to rid the world (okay, at least New York) of evil, when he is challenged by nemesis, The Green Goblin, (Dafoe, in a wonderfully wicked performance) who unbeknownst to Spidey, is really his best friend's father. The movie is face paced, funny and filled with so much action, that you don't dare leave your seat to get more popcorn for fear of missing out on the fun. The movie is not without its flaws, however. For instance, the computer generated characters seem, well, ..obviously computer generated, which disrupts the action and is distracting. Also, some of the dialogue is unintentionally laughable, most notably in a later scene where M.J. (Peter's girlfriend) pours her heart out to him. Despite these minor problems, however, this movie is worth the wait you'll have standing in line to see it!
10.0~One of the best films of 2002, if not the best film ab-2 Sign in Permalink Spider-man is another comic superhero to go to the big screen. The final result is a perfect film. Yeah that's LOTR fans. This is a perfect film. It has a great cast who do not disappoint at all. If at all Willem Dafoe should get a Best Supporting Actor nod. The EFX i though was good. I think the Oscars this should definitly get nods for are: Best Editing, Best Effects, Visual Effects, Best Effects, Sound Effects Editing,, Best Costume Design. 10/10
7.0~Get a grip.... favager Sign in Permalink Not as good as the first Superman or the first Batman, but still a reasonable effort. If you liked the Spidey comic or cartoon series you'll like this...be warned though...some of the "special" effects look very, very dodgy indeed!!! If you're not a superhero fan then you're probably better off looking elsewhere cause this isn't going to win any oscars!
2.0~Waste of two hours geto9 Sign in Permalink This movie turned out to be for me a waste of 2 hours. I heard it was good but learned very shortly after that I shouldn't believe what people say. The movie to me was based around a weak plot and was fueled by several action scenes full of special effects to draw the viewer away from the non-existent plot. This movie is your typical corny, hero vs. arch enemy movie. If the first 90 minutes of the movie do not convince you of this than the "exciting" and "suspenseful" ending will convince you. Within this worthless movie there is one thing worth noting. That is the performance of William Dafoe. Dafoe is the perfect and maybe the only actor who could of pulled off his portrayal of the Green Goblin. But overall don't waste your time or money, because this movie is terrible.
6.0~A movie for kids.... Meckjompa Sign in Permalink If i had been seven years old when i saw this movie i would have been SO excited about it. But i'll have to face the facts....i'm not! OK i know the movie is supposed to be corny and all that because thats the way most of the spider-man comics were done. But all i could think of after the movie was how much better and darker it would have been if it had been done the way Todd "Spawn" Mcfarlane did spider-man at one time. No it just didn't do it for me. The love story was worse than both Titanic and AOTC and just made me bored. Of course a couple of good scenes were there, and for the first 30 min i was actually thinking that this can turn out to be pretty good. But during and after the wrestling scene the movie took a turn for the worse. Rating 6/10
10.0~The most impressive comic book-adaptation ever! Y-Sly Sign in Permalink "With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility"... those who cannot understand these words they will not like the movie. Spider-Man is the best comic hero of all time! I bought the DVD Tuesday and I like the moive better and better... When I first heard that my favourite director, Sam Raimi will direct the new Spidey-movie, I was very happy. Danny Elfman' score, the acting and everything is beautiful. The only bug is the CGI, sometimes it is not so good. This is 2002s best movie. In my opinion: 10 out of 10.
8.0~Spider-Man Hits Hollywood bubromer Sign in Permalink I think this is a good movie that has stood the test of time. It is both the best and worst Hollywood can offer. Great action sequences, good easy to follow story, good acting, good effects, good costumes, a certain amount of (pinko liberal) social commentary but also a great deal of soft sentimentality which makes me glad for a satirical show like South Park, although I do not claim to be impervious to the sentimentality as even after watching the movie several times, I am still stirred by it, almost despite myself. Most importantly, Spider-Man the movie does the comic book justice. It lacks the gritty humour of the comic strip and yes, Tobey Maguire lacks the intellectual/spiritual maturity of the comic book Peter Parker, not to mention his wit and likability as a guy, but, to my mind, he does a good job for the most. My favourite performance in the film is that of James Franco - I think he really shines in this film. The film has its clichés but they are not jarring - for example, the military giant Oscorp creating a super-villain in the form of the Green Goblin (unlike the star review, I think his costume is awesome, and so is Spidey's), corporate power struggles, some script that is a little iffy (but hey that is what you get in comic books and I personally like its simplicity and lack of pretentiousness), boy becoming adult, woman (Mary Jane) as spur for manly self-overcoming (Peter Parker) etc. At the risk of sounding too intellectual, I think the film shines in its caricatured portrayal of America and New York in particular, where you get a sense of the diversity of individuals (for example when different people utter their views on the new super-hero in town), the difficulties of making a living and holding down a job and the difficult process of starting out in life (developed further in the excellent sequel) (made even more difficult by the bullying tactics of self-glorifying entrepreneur/petty capitalist Jona Jameson and chef Enrique (Mary Jane's employer))... There is a strong Christian ethos that permeates the film's (moral) philosophy. This last thread is personified in the film by the character of Ben Parker who coins the phrase "with great power comes great responsibility", easily transferable to America's role as world superpower, several references to the Bible, the Lord's Prayer, a Christian church in the background: in short good versus evil. (In Spider-Man 3, true to the comic book, Spider-Man's evil symbiotic costume is got rid of in a Christian church - a very transparent metaphor). On the evil side, of course, we have goblin, and Defoe who I think is really good as the mentally ill villain. Osborn Senior's collection of masks points to a primal awareness of the power of disguise and warrior gear (developed interestingly in Batman Begins "To overcome fear, you must become fear", i.e. Batman and the notion of the symbol), all or nothing, psychotic and cynical thinking that is characteristic of our view of "evil" as well as this idea that the masses are made, in Osborn's words, to drive the few to become exceptional and be carried on the teeming masses' shoulders. Two scenes in this film I find graphically exceptional: the scene in the burning building where Spidey confronts Goblin for the second or third time, and the final confrontation in the graveyard, which I find visually stunning and violently dark in an effective way. On an aesthetic level then, this film largely succeeds. The lighting is "comic bookie" but not jarring (except in some sequences in Times Square), there are brilliant and subtle transition graphics such as when an explosion blends into graduate hats being thrown in the air or when Peter Parker is designing his costume and there is quite a lot of caricatured yet quite accurate representation of crowd mentality such as the one watching gladiatorial combat in the form of the wrestling contest. To conclude this review, I would say that this feature film has quite a bit of meat to it, if one is prepared to pay attention, and, like the best of comic books, has a good deal of reality seeping into it, despite appearances. Eight out of ten.
10.0~Welcome back Sam cutshaw-2 Sign in Permalink I don't know whether he had to do The Gift and For Love of the Game to get the opportunity to do this, but after seeing SpiderMan, those two duds were definitely worth it. Sam Raimi is my favourite director and Spider Man is my favourite comic hero, so when I initially heard of this film I was excited as heck and scared witless. I was going to get my expectations too high and believe all the hype only to be delivered another piece of Hollywood junk. As high as my expectations were, they were no match for this film. From the opening title sequence I knew I could sit back and enjoy the ride. With the exceptions of not enough Spidey one-liners and M.J. looking stoned when I think she's supposed to be romantic, it's an absolutely flawless (well, except for those 2 previously mentioned things) masterpiece! Good going Raimi. Now make another one of those studio Spider Man flicks and start working on Evil Dead 4! Bruce Campbell ain't gettin' no younger.
10.0~Magnificient movie otacon21 Sign in Permalink I have watched three times so far this movie and I think´s it has it all. The action scenes are pretty good, William Dafoe makes an excellent interpretation as Green Goblin, and the are no words for Tobey McGuire (and at first the producers didn´t like him). We all have to thank you Sam Raimi for this great movie. So, I´m looking forward to Spider-Man 2. Who will be Doctor Octopus, Sam Neill? and Bruce Campbell as The Lizard? We´ll find out very soon...
8.0~A classic childhood favourite Sewaat Sign in Permalink Though my memories are vague, I recall seeing this film for the first time around the age of seven years old. Most clearly, I remember feeling an abundance of joy whenever this movie was put into my VCR player. And when Danny Elfman's amazing score began it's first notes with the visual of the Columbia pictures logo....I felt a rush of child-like wonder and excitement fill me. I knew I was in for a treat. What can I say about this movie, now? Well, I can tell you that some of it's bigger strengths lie in the casting decisions. And look no further than the decision to cast Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman. At the story's beginning, Maguire comes off as a dork and a nerd. Exactly as he's meant to be. But when pushed to the extreme, his character can change from mild-mannered teenager to heroic vigilante when need be. It's a fantastic blend of realism and fantasy that one expects from a super-hero. And this version of Spiderman is no exception. But the actor who really over-shadows the whole production, is Willem Dafoe as Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin. His bi-polar tendencies make for an extremely shifty and mysterious performance. He comes off as being both terrifying and hilarious when the situation calls for it. If the film had not possessed the amazing talent of either of these stars, than perhaps it wouldn't have been nearly as charming. It can't be denied that the film suffers from a sprinkling of corny moments. Both from the characters and the action sequences itself. Fortunately, these silly moments are few and far between. And the drama and intensity of the story arc over-shadows anything that can be considered too over the top or ridiculous. It is the darkness that this film weaves(no pun intended)ambiguously into the plot that saves the film from becoming another "kid-friendly" super hero bomb. Though it can be sometimes laughable and cliché in a certain light, it's without a doubt one of the more passionate super hero films to date. It underlines the moral message of courage and responsibility. Both things that turn a boy into a man as Peter comes to term with through-out the story. So, in a manner of speaking...Sam Raimi's 2002 marvel masterpiece could be considered the most elaborate coming of age story yet. Combined with the compelling spirit of what it truly means to be a hero.
9.0~This movie caught me in its web! jjo999 Sign in Permalink This is definitely a great movie. It has action, romance, and outstanding acting. Tobey Maguire does a great job, and manages to maintain the appearance of a hero, hunk, and nerd all at the same time. (Why couldn't high school boys be like that? LOL!!) Anyway, Kirsten Dunst was beautiful and fit into her role so well. I can definitely see her appearing in other super hero movies. She gives off the same vibe as actresses like the talented Nicole Kidman, and Michelle Pheiffer. I never got into Spiderman comic books growing up, but I loved the movie. It really met my expectations very well, and though many people may disagree with me, there's something about the Spiderman movies that holds my interest even more than the Batman movies. I guess you could say Spiderman is my favorite super hero. Go figure! I don't even like spiders!
6.0~Good movie, but overrated, the problem was the way the story was brought to the big screen orjg2 Sign in Permalink The main problem with this movie was not the actor chosen to play/portray the central character. The main problem was the way this story was brought to the big screen Spider-Man is one of the best superheros ever, a great character, wisely written by Stan Lee as a very vulnerable, very human superhero; it is the only superhero story that actually gives a moral message, which is a great truth: with great power comes great responsibility, yet, the movie plot, unlike the comics and the TV cartoons, barely develops the relationship between Peter and uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson was a right choice for this character), instead Spider-Man offers nothing less and nothing more than what you'd expect from a superhero blockbuster: special effects, action sequences and a very light (almost weak) plot. The screenplays for Batman and Superman were written by very, very, very talented people (Mario Puzo, Frank Miller, Sam Hamm, Warren Skaaren) therefore the final product was both entertaining and interesting. David Koepp's screenplay was good and acceptable but far from great, far from captivating: no character development, no deep dialogue, no interesting human dynamics, it was simply pure summer blockbuster "trash food". Spider-Man 2 on the other hand, was better written. Granted Tobey Maguire probably was not the best choice to play Spider-Man, but I think he has made a good job, the problem, like I said, was the movie itself. Thank you for your attention. Sincerely: Orjg2
10.0~Must see movie of the year! jverdin Sign in Permalink A great re-creation, of Stan Lee's Spiderman. It is a thrilling movie with the best animation and action sceens. Though some of the movie is not as the comic book told years ago but the movie made up for that with dizzying anti-gravity web slinging. Old web heads got his work cut out for him with some "moive specialist" but what do they know anyway.
6.0~Too many flaws OwenThePainter Sign in Permalink While the film does have a lot of good aspects (Sam Raimi's direction, the casting especially with Tobey Maguire and Willem DaFoe), there are four main gripes with this film that always impinge my enjoyment of it. Plot holes. The wrestling promoter would know Spiderman's identity (after seeing him pulling off his stunts in the ring), and also has an axe to grind with him - after he did nothing to prevent the robber from taking the money. For some reason however he doesn't bother to go to anyone about it when he could charge a lot of money to reveal Spiderman's alter ego. His origin. This may seem like a geeky fanboy quip, but I thought that the events leading up to the murder of Ben Parker and the creation of the crime-fighting Spider-man made Peter appear particularly inhuman and bitter. The scenes also lacked the emotional force of the comic, or even the 90s animated series. Badguy deaths. I could accept that the thief who murdered Ben might have had an accident where Spiderman would be on a thin line of did he/ didn't he kill him, but when the same fate befell the Green Goblin, it stank of a cop-out by the makers. Yankee heroics. As a non-American filmgoer, I find it disgusting that we must once again have American culture (or the movie version of American culture) rubbed in our faces. The scene on the bridge was bad enough ("You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us" or something similar had most of the people in the cinema rolling their eyes and groaning - why didn't the Goblin just pumpkin bomb them anyway?) but to end the film with Spiderman on a pole with a huge waving USA flag just made it worse. In a film such as Superman, the character's Americanism can be tolerated as he is known for being an American hero, but Spiderman is supposed to be a world hero - someone everyone can look up to, as even Raimi said. There is also the topic of incidental music and theme, or lack thereof, but I don't think that any major gripes can be drawn over miniscule details such as that. The (mostly poor)CGI and reappearing boom mic also distracted. Also, was it necessary for Kirsten Dunst to get her shirt wet? I'm not complaining, but gratuitous sexual images both p*** me off and turn me on at the same time. Must be the hormones. 5/10
10.0~If only all movies were this good... nash8114 Sign in Permalink The story is superb (but what else could we expect from a story that has been worked on for years...). It doesn't follow the comics nor cartoon movies, which gives the movie a unique twist. Even if you know the original story line you won't know the movie's end. Its not your average all day 'end good all good' type of movie... It goes deeper than that :-) Good action, good acting (on the hero's part anyway... villain could be better). Good story and good end :-D
4.0~Never got off the drawing board! caARACER Sign in Permalink I love Toby McGuire, and as Peter Parker he was perfect. But I just never was able to believe he was in the Spider-man costume. Kirsten Dunst seemed very stiff and flat in the role of Mary Jane. The special effects were good, but I don't go to a movie to see special effects. Also, far too often it was very easy to tell where the live action ended the animation began. All in all I was very disappointed in the movie.
7.0~Could be much better with this changes. Moroco Sign in Permalink SPOILER Even though the visual effects are spectacular and the movie itself is quite entertaining when i left the cinema i felt that it could have been much better just changing a few details. First of all, I don´t understand why the director changed esential parts from the original story. I think it is unfear to change such important moment in spiderman life like the beginning of his special power. It is also untrue that the spider´s web is another natural gift. People should know that Peter Parker was not a stupid at all and that he was able to invent this speciall web. Probably the Director thaught that this way the movie was going to be much "fun". It was also unnecesary to make mentions to the actuality (E.g. Julia Roberts). They are only effect was to take you out from spiderman´s fantastic world. I would like to mention the Green Goblin carachter. I think that Dafoe ´s own face would have been much better than the unexpresive mask they ´ve used in the film. Finally i will refer to the end of the movie. I have just can´t understand how the created such a stupid death for the Green Goblin. This confirms that the fact that you have wasted so much money doesn´t mean that your film is going to be creative.
8.0~Great! GCham82 Sign in Permalink I have to say this is probably the best superhero/comic book movie I have ever seen. However I have yet to see X-Men 2, which I have heard is great, but Spiderman is definately better than X-Men and the Superman films. The Batman films started off well, but by the end were laughable. I really enjoyed Spiderman and thought they told the story extremely well. I can't wait for the sequel!
10.0~Jumpin' Genomics, Batman! silvertn Sign in Permalink Back off, Batman, Spidey RULES! Where radiation could only give the original Spidey super-senses, GENOMICS makes him totally real. Just wait till you see how cool the webslinging is portrayed; even BETTER than we imagined ourselves as young Sixties Spidies, four decades ago. For kids of the 60's and our own kids, the Spiderman movie fully delivers on both the comic book and Saturday morning cartoon dream.
2.0~it is what it is... brickmadsen Sign in Permalink This isn't a bad movie, it is what it is and not much more. The only qualm I have with this film is couldn't the bad guy be a bit better than a power ranger bad guy, what a joke seeing that guy in there. Kirsten Dunst is lovely though it must be said, especially when it rains.
10.0~Everything I thought it would be....... sasfood Sign in Permalink very mild spoiler........but not the ending This movie was very true to the comic, which I read and collected en masse as a youngster. ( age 34 now). I would have liked to have seen more biting wit and sarcasm from Spidey, and the CGI effects were pretty obvious, but didn't detract too bad. The web shooting wasn't exactly how it was in the comics either, coming straight out of his wrists instead from a web-shooter Parker invented. I'll go back and seE 6. again. It'll end up being one of the best movies I saw in 2002.
9.0~What do you want?! Shawshank 2! cosmorados Sign in Permalink Because when I look at various comments on these pages regarding this film, and other blockbusters, I feel that this is what people want in every film they see and I don't know why. When I go to see a drama I see a drama, when I want to see a comedy I see a comedy, why does every film have to be "The Godfather" otherwise it's badly acted and scripted? The only films that tend to buck this trend are superhero films that have character actors as their lead. The truth is that this is a really good blockbuster film. The story revolves around Peter Parker and his conversion from nerdy college kid to crime fighting superhero, at the same time as his nemesis, the evil Green Goblin, is spawned from his best friend's father Norman Osborn, and whilst Peter is Spider-Man, Norman's persona splits, tearing into the quiet and benign Norman, who eventually becomes the bullied victim of the controlling and evil Green Goblin. Like most good adaptations it stays pretty close to its source material and, in some areas, improves on them. The cast are are excellent in their respective roles with particular plaudits going to Willem Dafoe whose switches from Goblin to Norman are so perfect that you are never left in doubt who is who as his persona becomes more fractured. Cliff Robertson and JK Simmons are equally good as inspirational Uncle Ben and Uninspirational J. Jonah Jameson respectively. The action set pieces are all handled supremely well and even though some of the effects aren't brilliant, because of the overall strength of the film it matters little as the characters and story keep your interest so much that it doesn't matter if some of the effects aren't up to the standard of other blockbusters with less charm, plot and characters. A great start to the spider-man series. Shame 3 lets the side down. Nuff said Em
10.0~What?! lukepiraccini Sign in Permalink Im new... A bunch oh Garfield fans put Maguire's movies as 1 star. Garfield is not as good. They also did it to Spider Man 2! And 3! People haven't even seen TASM2 and put 10 stars. Some of you guys are idiots! Dumb. Dumb. And Dumb. And also dumb! And Dumb. Maguire did 10 times better! Don't hate on him! TASM was awful. Hopefully 2 is better! It can't get muck worse. So don't put 10 stars for TASM cause of Garfield. And 1 cause of Maguire. Please don't hate on me cause I'm new.
10.0~Best comic book movie made and I disagree about some flaws morinb4593 Sign in Permalink First, let me say that I have never posted my thoughts before but Spiderman blew me away and some of what the critics have said have frustrated me so much that I feel compelled to respond. ***Spoilers below**** ALL of the cast was perfect in this film, even Mr. Dafoe. I grew up on Spiderman comics and I have always felt that the Goblin was meant to be an "Over the top" character and Mr. Dafoe played it pitch perfect. Some have said that his motivations are unclear but not to me. Osbourne is losing his company so the Goblin wants to protect him so to speak by taking out the competition and the board of directors as well, then when the wall crawler gets in the way, take him out as well. I will admit that the Goblin armour looks a bit strange but it did not bother me at all, since I read that they were going to use latex masks at first. The cheesiness of that idea scares me to death! Next, Spiderman has always been my favorite hero because of his vulnerability and human side. I was so glad to see that Mr. Raimi spent time developing the characters instead of taking the easy way out with constant action. Also, yes the CGI had a few flaws but I thought that added to the comic book feel and enhanced the film. ****Major Spoilers*** I thought the ending was super because it could be interpreted either way. I think MJ knows who Peter is by comparing the two kisses. I also did not miss Spidey's witty remarks because in this film, Peter is just learning his powers and has lost his uncle, so his seriousness makes perfect sense. Wittiness will come with time and confidence in his abilities. (i.e. sequels). This is by far the best comic book movie ever made! It has it all and can be enjoyed by everyone! Cant wait for the DVD!
10.0~Brilliant!!! smack_down81 Sign in Permalink There is no other word to describe the feeling you get after watching this movie. This movie was truly a labor of love for Sam Raimi and his whole crew. Tobey Maguire was an excellent Peter Parker, and a very fine Spider-Man. I never thought much of him when he was cast, but now I am eating my words. Willem Dafoe was very convincing as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, he was really scary in a surreal sort of way. Kirsten Dunst was a good choice for MJ too. JK Simmons was absolutely brilliant as J. Jonah Jameson, never laughed that hard in a while. Bruce Campbell as ring announcer at the wrestling match was great too. James Franco was good as Harry, also. Some scenes looked CGI really bad as opposed to others, but other than that, a fine film.
9.0~Love it! :D Green_Saturn Sign in Permalink Seeing this movie 8 years after it was made, I kind of expected rough CGI. I thought it was surprisingly good! (Even the Green Goblin wasn't too cheesy!) It's really easy to screw up a super-hero movie, as displayed by countless Super Man movies. This is not a bad super-hero movie. Aside from Iron Man, this is probably my favorite! Applause to Tobey Maguire for his performance in this. Looking at all the other choices to play Peter Parker/Spider-Man, including one of my favorites, Leo DiCaprio, I really can't think of a more suitable Spider-Man. There're a lot of physical scenes in this movie, (some are CGI, but as I mentioned the CGI is incredibly well done and there are parts where you are wondering if it's a Maguire or not) and he couldn't have done a better job. Not to mention he's just adorable in this and you can't take your eyes off him! I've never read a comic book in my life and I liked this. However, I'm a super-hero movie fan, so I asked around and most everyone had high remarks. High action and high entertainment- highly recommended to anyone looking for an action movie! (Be warned- once you see this one you'll want to see the second and third ones, too!)
8.0~Best comic movie yet jesus4ever Sign in Permalink When I went to see this I expected it be a 6 or 7 on a scale from 1-10. Maguire was better than expected (not too weak) as was the rest of the cast. Funny cameos, great puns (Dr. Connors) as well as great direction/special effects ,plus lots more, made this an enjoyable film for Spider-Man fans. For time sake, I will not go in-depth but it's a very fun movie overall.
8.0~It's got its web on me. vip_ebriega Sign in Permalink My Take: A challenging comic-book summer blockbuster with all the thrills you have come to expect, and more. There's much buzz about this movie before it was released, and even if I unfortunately missed the film in its theatrical release, I managed to catch up. SPIDER-MAN is the ideal summer blockbuster, and the fact that this film was a highly-praised summer attraction is understandable. Packed with state-of-the-art special effects creations that parade in front of the screen like magic, but also powered by a great story and a sharp focus on characters, SPIDER-MAN is a web of gold. Tobey Maguire is ideally cast as Peter Parker who, after being bit by the radioactive spider, is turned from ultimate nerd into the ultimate superhero of the title, but you all know that. But the film makes everything else interesting for the audience. Instead of being just your fairly typical summer event picture, living it up with special effects alone, this one actually has a story to boot, and interesting characters ranging from Parker, his family and the villain, Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), who turns into the evil Green Goblin. Director Sam Raimi doesn't dumb this one down as a visually exhilarating and incompetently plot-less summer picture. What SPIDER-MAN turns up to be is a terrific roller-coaster ride of an adventure, which gives audiences have much to think about. Although the sum of the parts are often uneven, SPIDER-MAN is still a wild ride of a summer movie that'll knock your socks off. And yes, it does live up to its hype. Rating: **** out of 5.
9.0~A Very Good Movie olivery2k Sign in Permalink This is a very good movie. I've seen it twice, and I would like to see it again, and again, and again.....My favorite character would be the Green Goblin/Norman Osborn because the bad guy makes the movie worth watching. I can't wait until it comes out on video. I'll be the first one to buy it....... 10/10
10.0~An accurate screen translation lynxspyder Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is the best comic-book to movie adaptation yet. Forget about the original Batman movie. Compared to Spider-Man, it doesn't hold up. Raimi has faithfully brought the world's favorite wallcrawler to the big screen and offered a fine introduction to what should prove to be an excellent series of films. For once, Hollywood has offered up a superhero film with more story than action, and that's what makes this movie work and why it is a thoroughly faithful representation of the comic book. Marvel pioneered the idea of looking at superheroes as real people. It did a lot in the '70s to show the people behind the masks and to highlight the problems that being a superhero causes in their personal lives. Spider-Man was the best at showing this, and the movie has accurately represented that. The only thing that detracts from the film at all is that the special effects are less than perfect. But given that you become so engrossed in the story, you hardly notice. Other movies rely too heavily on the special effects, so if there's the tiniest flaw, it makes the movie laughable. In Spider-Man, the special effects take a back seat to the characters and the story. I applaud Spider-Man as the best superhero movie made to date.
6.0~barely competent drama undermined by unfaithful adaptation Rovin Sign in Permalink There are two ways to look at Spider-man. One is as a summer escapist movie about a teenager undergoing a startling transformation from nerd to superhero. The other is as the first motion picture based on the 40 year old comic book character. In the first sense, Spider-man is a modestly entertaining summer action pic. The characters are sympathetic and there is just enough story cohesion to make the film satisfying. I didn't feel cheated, but I wasn't anxious to step in line to see it again either. The dialogue could be mediocre at times, but no worse than some other films of this genre. There were some ridiculously melodramatic touches--like the two romantic leads having lived beside each other for 12 years and never having spoken a word to each other---but overall the film delivered what it promised. And that was all. But as a longtime Spidey fan I could find some other faults with the film, changes to the accepted history, which in one case actually undermined the film as a coherent drama. Sam Raimi demonstrated that he could visualize a comic book world like no one else with Darkman(1990), although that heavy-handed melodramatic film suffered from a cruel streak--as if mocking the trials and tribulations of the tortured main character. Echoes of Darkman are found throughout Spider-man. Nevertheless, I welcomed the selection of Raimi--until word spread that he had decided that an audience could not accept that a high school science nerd in an IMAGINARY, FICTITIOUS, LARGER THAN LIFE, COMIC BOOK-INSPIRED movie would be able to come up with mechanical webshooter devices--a trademark attribute of the comic book character and every television incarnation. Instead, they would be organic--existing as part of the mutation Peter Parker develops from the spider bite. Now, one could point out that developing super powers from a spider bite is also difficult to accept, as is the idea that a man from another planet who looks completely human could fly around in a red cape and shoot laser beams from his eyes. But alas, the decision was made. High schooler Peter Parker would have to demonstrate his scientific genius by... writing a term paper on nano-technology, and prove his creative genius by being a rather skilled fashion artist and costume designer! Some Hollywood apologists counter that we could not expect any screen time to the webshooter fabrication because of the length of the movie. Nonsense. A one minute-montage would have sufficed. No audience member would have walked out in protest. But the webshooter issue is actually minor in comparison to another change in the origin story. In the comics, Peter originally had no friends, and while he was interested in girls he did not have any particular crush. The decision was made to condense his social experiences so that his later friend Harry Osbourne would be introduced from the beginning(thus removing Parker's status as a loner) , and to establish that Mary Jane Watson was his destined love(an embellishment not established in the comics until 20 years later). This latter change undermines the story of Peter Parker, devoting far too much screen time to the personal problems of Mary Jane as well as Harry, and creating an awkward moment for the film's conclusion. In the comics, Peter was always concerned that some super-villain would discover his true identity and hurt his loved ones---but the manner in which this is conveyed in the film's final moments is problematic and left some members of the audience I viewed the film with wondering: (MINOR SPOILER) "Huh? After all that talk about how he loved her, he rebuffs her advances?" One other change worthy of note: The character of Flash Thompson is reduced to a one dimensional bully--in the comics he tormented Peter Parker but was actually Spider-man's number one fan. The cast was certainly competent, given the material they were working with. Maguire and Dunst were sufficient in their roles, although i would not say that neither of them embodied the spirit of comic book characters. Maguire's Peter Parker was sympathetic, but subdued, lacking the introspection and expressiveness of his comic book counterpart(and as stated above, wallowing too much on his relationship with Mary Jane). As Spider-man, he did not employ many wise cracks and taunts, another trademark of the comic book and cartoon persona. Dunst's Mary Jane was well played, but her interest in Peter Parker was obvious from the beginning--a very artificial love story. With the exception of the final shot of Spider-man, the FX work relied too much on computer graphics that were not always convincing, and in some cases distant, detracting from an epic feel to the visuals. The biggest design problem would have to be the decision to hide Willem Dafoe's face under an expressionless helmet rather than make up prosthetics. It detracted from the performance in a couple of key scenes. And the music was truly sub-par. Recycling the tv cartoon theme from the 1960s would have contributed more energy (although they did find a way to incorporate it into the film at one brief point). Overall, Spider-man does not achieve the accomplishment of the original Superman, nor does it fall as flat as Batman.
9.0~What a ride! More Fun Than Batman! dsmgdesign Sign in Permalink A fun, enjoyable action flick with a super cool story line, this is without a doubt the best movie I've seen all year! If I were the casting director, I might have picked someone other than Tobey MaGuire. But the chemistry between MaGuire and Kirsten Dunst is undoubtably what landed them the parts. Also, William Dafoe is no Jack Nicolson (as the Joker) no question. But then who is as great as Jack -- NOBODY! And, compared to Batman, this script was written for a younger audience. But ya know what? You could also argue Tim Burton's Bruce Wayne was too dark and mysterious. You couldn't help but like Sam Raimi's Peter Parker. But if you take Batman and Superman and put it on a shelf, and look at Spiderman for it's own value, this movie is genuinely good clean fun! The special effects just blew me away. It raises the bar for movie makers. I can't wait for the sequel.
6.0~2.5 stars mweston Sign in Permalink Peter Parker (played by Tobey Maguire) is a very smart, very socially awkward high school student who lives with his aunt and uncle. He is in love with Mary Jane Watson (a.k.a., "M.J.", played by Kirsten Dunst), and has been since she moved in next door when they were both children. One day they are both on a field trip, and a genetically altered, radioactive spider bites Peter. He feels ill and goes home to fall asleep. When he wakes up he begins to figure out that his body has changed. He is far stronger, can stick to surfaces, and then there are the webs. Meanwhile, Peter's best friend's father, Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), runs a large company attempting to sell advanced technology to the military. When an experiment in human augmentation stalls, he decides to make himself a human guinea pig, and he begins his transformation into the extremely schizophrenic Green Goblin. That's just the set-up. There's a lot more story, as Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man, and then, with the help of his uncle, figures out what Spider-Man should stand for. Tobey Maguire does a better job of this transition than most actors one might have thought of casting for a superhero role would have, but he isn't given enough to work with. And Kirsten Dunst has even less to do. Willem Dafoe might be the stand out, but only because he is supposed to chew the scenery and does, quite effectively. Director Sam Raimi is apparently a huge fan of the comic book hero, and he has given this film a distinctly comic book feel, starting from the comic book opening credits. This can be charming at times, but, for me at least, falls flat at many others. The dialog is unintentionally funny far too often. I'll sum up here with my summary as we left the theater on 5/17/2002: This movie somehow manages to be both entertaining *and* lame.
7.0~An odd mixture of Burton's "Batman" and Donner's "Superman" that works. fjhuerta-2 Sign in Permalink *Mild spoilers ahead* It's not really a surprise, is it? A superhero is a superhero is a superhero, after all. Good thing is, this movie doesn't disappoint on many levels. It's a good movie. An entertaining movie. A nice departure from the moralistic / ultraviolent / depressive superhero movies of the last decade. And it does seem better than "Superman", but not quite as good as "Batman", which is a very, very good thing. There are way too many parallels with those two movies, actually. It takes the strong, colorful, happy world of Superman, mixes it with the hero's search for belonging, and in the process makes Peter Parker's everyman character to be immediately identified with the viewer. He's not tall. He's not strong. He's not popular. Yet he wishes so much to be. He's a likeable intelligent, everyday man just looking to make sense out of his life. Then, it takes the dark philosophical conflicts of Batman. He carries a responsability he decided to bring upon himself. He is condemned to live a life he wouldn't have chosen in the first place. Once he finds some inner strength, he has to sacrifice his personal life for the good of others. That, the dark alley scenes, and, of course, the balloon parade (a scene which is lifted intact from Batman, except that now the scene is filmed in broad daylight - the parade, the ballons exploding, the aerial chase shootout). Curiously enough, this scene also features some shoots eerily similar to Louise Lane falling from the helicopter - except now, it's M.J. about to fall from a balcony. There is a lesson in here for George Lucas, if he can swallow his pride for once. The lesson is, people like movies about everyday men leading extraordinary lives. Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Peter Parker, Bruce Wayne, Clark Kent, Neo, "Jack" - they were all ordinary men who happened to be in the right place at the right time. And they all had a jolly good time with it. As such, Spider-man is a very good, entertaining film which takes its cues from 2 excellent superhero movies. Hey, imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, right?
7.0~Enjoyable...but Batman is better. michiel.aptroot Sign in Permalink I want to compare this movie with the classic Batman movie from 1989. The movie resembles a lot to the classic by Tim Burton, but Spider-Man fails in delivering strong characters. In the Batman movie the character of Bruce Wayne is deeply affected by the murder of his parents and the movie explains how he has become the person he is. In Spider-Man Peter Parker is bitten by a spider and the action starts from there, now that's just a little too simple for me. I also thought the Green Goblin was kind of a corny villain. The suit he wears is incredibly boring and looks a lot like one from the Japanese Ultraman. Also character building is an issue here, Willem Dafoe does a fine job, but his character isn't really frightening. Compared to Jack Nicholson's Joker he is just a wimp. Still Spider-Man is a fun movie to watch and it will not bore you. But it is not the classic it could have been. Rating : 3 stars out of 5
4.0~didn't have to be so lame luke14 Sign in Permalink Why was this movie so lame? Why was the dialogue so horrible? Why did normally good actors suck? The cheese factor was through the roof. Why does Hollywood dumb down everything? I want answers. Actually, nevermind, I don't even care. This movie is not worth seeing, so don't go see it. Trust me. All hype, no substance.
5.0~Just another superhero movie paul2001sw-1 Sign in Permalink Comic book adaptations are ten-a-penny these days; and while Tobey Maguire, so often annoyingly dopey, is a natural to play Peter Parker, the amazing Spider-Man's alter ego, overall, I found this film ordinary. There's some good stuff: I liked the idea of Parker trying out his super-powers in a wrestling competition, but his subsequent development into a full-blown superhero seemed accelerated, and a wasted opportunity. I also found the Green Goblin, with his static mask, a frustrating enemy - his failure to move his jaw when speaking makes one feel like one is reading a static strip, not watching a moving picture. The film gains some tension towards the end, but whereas 'Batman Begins' grew on me in spite of myself, 'Spider-Man' didn't; and there's some overplayed moralising in the mix as well. In some ways, comic books boil down a story to its essence, and the rest is all in the visuals; the same is true for this film, and for me, there's not enough complexity to make it truly interesting.
6.0~Quite ordinary valadas Sign in Permalink In this kind of Robin Hood of the modern times movies the first place still belongs to Batman since none better has been done since then. The rest is just only special effects today made ordinary by simple computer work. So nothing special to point out in this movie. And the very final scene is totally unnecessary and out of place. It must be dismissed as pure propaganda which has nothing to do with the art of cinema.
7.0~Spider-Man (2002) is the perfect example of a Superhero Origin done right! EddyTheMartian007 Sign in Permalink Spiderman is one of the first CBMs I ever watched, and it was the movie which introduced me to Spiderman. After this movie I started to really like Spiderman. Anyways This Movie has surprisingly aged pretty well. There are some very goofy parts(like the bomb which turns people into skeletons), especially near the beginning, but for the most part this is a pretty solid movie. I think the beginning of the movie is probably the weakest, but as it progresses it does get much better. In the beginning of the movie we get the origins of both Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Norman Osborn (Willem Defoe) with both of them being a goofy in their own way. Peter being in a museum where one of 14 genetically modified spiders escapes and bites Peter, and possibly bites other people?! Also the Spider gives peter abs. Also peter doesn't tell anyone about getting bitten by a radioactive spider? I mean you'd probably die. We also get Green Goblin yelling like a madman when he very stupidly tests out the serum on himself. I thought the motivations were told well enough, but it was shown way to quick. The school bits with peter weren't very convincing, they didn't feel like an actual school, and when he figures out his powers it didn't really make sense logically, especially when he's jumping off of Buildings with some very outdated CGI. I do think Norman's descend into insanity was done very well. Once we get to Peter's relationship with Aunt May(Rosemary Harris), and Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) (which are both great) the movie really picks up and gets much better. The dialogue between Uncle Ben and Peter is really good, and they feel like a family, and when the "with great power comes great responsibility" line is dropped it has a huge impact. The relationship is relatable to people who've lost someone. When Uncle Ben dies because of Peter "revenge" against the Wrestling Promoter, it's handled extremely well. Peter in some way caused his Uncle's death and Peter feels responsible. When Uncle Ben dies it's emotional and you feel the impact and dread it brings peter. He's once again filled with revenge trying to kill his supposed killer. Once again when he "accidentally" cause the killer to die peter realized what he has done, and then it hits him. "With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility". Peter now realizes he should use he's powers for good, and thus Spiderman is born! Also he made his own suit somehow... Peter's Arc in the movie is one of the best parts of this film. Another great relationship is Harry (James Franco) and Norman Osborn. Harry is really good in this movie, Peter and Harry's friendship is established since the beginning and it's done well. There's a great Juxtaposition done with Peter and Uncle Ben's connection, compared to Harry's and Norman's connection. Uncle Ben was always kind and close to Peter while Norman is always cold and distant to Harry. It brews a good rivalry between Harry and Peter when Norman wants a son like Peter. The other character and one of the weaker ones, but still good enough is Mary Jane (Kristen Dunst). She unfortunately is the average Damsel in Distress. They try to give her some more character with having abusive parents, but it's never expanded on. Peter's and Her relations ship is kinda weird, it works better when it was Spiderman and MJ, but Peter feels kinda weird around her. I think Norman Osborn was a pretty good villain, his motivations make some sense, and he's insane so it's a bit more excusable. Willem Dafoe's performance was very enjoyable, and I think he brought some good character. The only real problem I have with him is the motivations against Spiderman aren't exactly too clear. Despite this I thought he was a pretty solid villain, and the 3rd act with him making Peter choose MJ or children was very good. The ending of Norman accidentally killing himself, and Peter revealing to Harry that he "killed" his father brings more rivalry for the future. Overall I think this was a very good movie. I do have a few problems, like the beginning of the film. That really brought this movie down for me. Also it's kinda goofy in some areas, but when it's serious it hits. The rest of the movie is really good though, and to me this is the perfect example of a CBM origin movie. 7/10
8.0~Worthy of the hype... qball_82 Sign in Permalink This is perhaps the only film I've ever seen that's lived up to the hype. Big kudos to Sam Raimi on such an excellent film, and the cast who did such a great job with the characters. I've never read the comics (I did watch the cartoon though!) so I don't know how well it has been translated to the big screen, but I thought the movie played exactly like I imagine the comic book would. Big action scenes, colorful settings and just the right amount of humor. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, but then it doesn't totally go all out tongue-in-cheek. Sam Raimi managed to balance it excellently. At times it seemed a little slow, and longer than it was, but that's really the only negative I can come up with. Go see it, you wont be disappointed....definitely one to buy on DVD when it comes out too!
8.0~GREAT!!!!!!! raiderfan911 Sign in Permalink Spiderman could possibly be the greatest comic book come to life movie ever!!!! i was a little bit worried that Tobey Maguire wouldnt fit as spiderman. man was i wrong. After watching the movie i realized that he was the only person in the world that could have played spiderman that perfect. The special effects in the movie were some of the best that ive ever seen. everybody needs to see this about 2 times each. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!
9.0~You just can not resist its web... djtwizzy Sign in Permalink What makes or breaks a movie usually boils down to how that movie makes you feel. The worst movies may make you angry, or irritated - while the best films leave you feeling as if you don't have a worry in the world. Spider-Man was everything but a bad movie because of the way it made me feel. I wanted to soar effortlessly through the air; I wanted to cast webs. The truth is, for those couple of hours there was nothing I wanted more than to be a spider. This is where the movie succeeded. For a while, I had no clue of where I was - but I knew exactly where I wanted to be. When the ending credits carried back my unfortunate human reality, I couldn't help but to smile at truly such a great job done. If you haven't seen Spider-Man - drive to your favorite theater now. Better yet - run. Climb a few walls on your way there, get into character. Wear a costume. Let Spider-Man have fun with you for a day. Why not? You'll love it - probably could use it, and it couldn't hurt us one bit. Farewell...
10.0~AWESOME!!! russ_beer Sign in Permalink This film is AWESOME! i was pretty disappointed when i heard tobey maguire was going to play spiderman, and that willem dafoe was the goblin, but boy! was i wrong, the two of them are great, especially dafoe who is remarkably evil as the green goblin. dont want to spoil it for anyone, but i'll use just 4 words to describe my opinion: watch it, love it!
7.0~Loads of Fun, But That's it. sgt_tsuyoi Sign in Permalink I gotta admit, this movie was fun and entertaining. However it seemed a little too shallow and underdeveloped. Much of the characters true conflicts are not shown to us through effective, emotional means. Instead much happens through expository dialogue. Don't just tell us what will happen, show us! Spider-man's plot, isn't too new. We've seen it before in "Superman" and "Batman." This film seems to have borrowed elements from both of those films, thus lacks some originality. Both of the former explored their heroes' and the villians' characters more in depth. Both films gave us a true feeling of how their heroes/villians felt when saving people or vice versa. "Superman" and "Batman" had their action scenes revolve around the heroes and villians' lifelong conflicts, something that must exist or else there would've been no movie. Yes, Parker's humble beginnings and the Green Goblin's tragedy are introduced to us, but as soon as things kick off, this film seems to rush into violent-action sequences right away. This story "revolves around violence." C'mon give the Green Goblin and Spider-man a little something more substantial to gnaw on. The film did have some great moments. The web-roping around the city was awesome and breath-taking! If only "Batman" had been filmed with similar technology. Spider-man's evolution was also brilliant. Especially the origin of his name. Minor references to "Gladiator (2000)" and "Superman" were interesting. However, much of the CG animation made the action sequences look too sped-up and unreal, like someone pressed the "FF" button on the VCR or something. It had a "Power Rangers" look to it. Major plotholes: why did MJ and the Green Goblin not try to uncover Spider-man's identity when they had the chance. They didn't even attempt it. Why does Spider-man have unlimited web-spitting ability? The amount of webbing that he ejected was more in volume than three times his body volume. Spiders take a lot of time to "knit" a web. Why does the web's come out already done? Also, where in the world did a kid like Peter Parker get such an awesome suit? He can't knit it himself. And he surely didn't enlist the aid of Oscorp. There are things that we want to know here, part I. There are other plot holes, but I do not want to have spoilers to ruin an otherwise entertaining movie. Yes, it feels like a Japanese superhero-cult film and it feels like to vehicle to sequels and merchandise, but it is great, fun way to start out the summer. The first true summer movie of 2002. For its pace and fun I can still manage to give it 3* out of 4*.
10.0~10 Star Movie torrey277 Sign in Permalink Spider-Man was one of those quality movies that comes ever so often. It truly was my favorite movie of all time. The casting was great, the action was great, the plot was great, the affects were great, the chemistry between Peter and Mary Jane was great, everything was great. The perfect movie. This movie deserves every star it could possibly get, I'd even rate it off the scale if I could.
9.0~well done all around erigam Sign in Permalink The only thing that was prehaps missing from the movie was the Ramones cover of the theme song Spiderman but, all cast and crew delivered a great movie. Prehaps one of the best adaptations to date.Tobey Maguire, Kristen Dunst, Willem Dafoe all deliver and Sam Raimi makes the movie work to perfection.
1.0~Spider-Man: A Web Of Garbage? sweetnlowdown2 Sign in Permalink First I feel it's only fair that I start my review off by saying that I usually dislike the American public's taste in movies. I personally feel they are attracted to garbage. 9\10 whenever I know the American public gets beind a movie, I usually expect the worst. "Spider-Man" is a moronic, juvenile, tasteless, poorly acted excuse for a movie. Know, yes, yes I know people are going to say well, it's just a good "popcorn flick". It's a guilty pleasure. Okay, I can understand that way of thinking, but, "Spider-Man" isn't even a good "popcorn flick". I have guilty pleasures too. I like "teen" movies. I like films like "Scream", "Can't Hardly Wait", "I Know What You Did Last Summer"...ect. But, there's a line that has to be drawn to seperate good and bad films. And "Spider-Man" is one of the year's worst films! I don't think I can fully express my sheer hatred for this movie. Is\was this movie actually worth all the attention it's getting? Absolutely not! There have been so many great films made over the years and this is the film that breaks all records! "Spider-Man"! What does that say about us? Nothing good, I'll tell you that right now! I'm not really a fan of Tobey Maguie, though, I do admit he has been in some good films, "The Ice Storm", Woody Allen's "Deconstructing Harry", & "Wonder Boys". But, in this film, Maguire, is life-less. His performance is awful. He just seems to drone on & on. People who say he gave a good performance have no clue as to what they are talking about. He does a really bad job. Next Kirsten Dunst. Now, I have a lot of admiration of Dunst. I think she is a very good actress. She has a presence to her that reminds me of something that older actresses have had. She seems to make the screen come alive with her "sunny disposition". Here however, is another story. Not even she turns in a good performance. I don't understand how people could say the have chemistry together. THEY DON'T! William Dafoe, another great actor. One of the most under-rated actors of our time I feel, and he's bad in this too! Now, is the problem really the actors or the script. In Maguire's case, he's the problem. He didn't and still doesn't seem to me to be the right choice for the movie. He doesn't seem, "heroic" enough for the part. He doesn't seem like a "leading man" to me. In the case of Dunst and Dafoe, the script ruined them. Dunst doesn't have a good role. She doesn't really have anything to act with. There is nothing special about her part. I can only think that she accepted the role on two things. 1 - the pay was probably great and 2 - everyone involved probably knew this film would have mass appeal to it. The same goes for Dafoe. Another problem I had with the film was, for a movie who's budget was 139 million dollars, where did the money go? Many scenes looked cheap. Especially he scenes where we see Spider-Man fly. It looked much more impressive in "Superman" which was made back in 1978! I was really suprised to see how bad some scenes looked. I have many many more problem with this film, but, I won't get into it. Bottomline: "Spider-Man" is a tasteless, lifeless movies that stinks from beginning to end. One of the year's worst films!
8.0~A great movie, for a great comic. MovieAddict2016 Sign in Permalink I just wrote a LONG comment on spider man, and I lost it, so I'm making this one short. Spider-Man was excellent. I've been thinking they should make it for YEARS. It compliments the comic very nicely, without the darkness some other comic-to-movie films have had in the past(Batman sequels -I thought the first Batman with M. Keaton had the perfect dark tough of Gotham City, so I do like the darkness in Bman 1). Tobey Maguire, I had my doubts about as Spider Man at first, but now I realize it great for the role. As was everyone else(hats off to Willem Defoe, perfectly portryaying the ever creepy Green Goblin). Although sometimes the graphics were a bit corny, and at a few scenes, I got a Power Rangers feeling when they weren't using graphics in a scene between G-goblin and Spiderman, just looking at them in the cheesy suits looked like something out of Power Rangers. However, this happened noly around 2 times in the film, and it wasn't a biggy. I loved Spider-Man and I can't wait for it to come out on DVD so I can snatch it in my web.4/5 stars-MovieCritc2003
1.0~Cliche and Predictable BonosLemon27 Sign in Permalink This movie is total crap, if this movie is what the interest is than America has really gone down hill. This is above Gone with the Wind on The top 250. This movie is predictable and juvenile. This is a kids movie with sex mixed in. Don't waste your time seeing it. You could go rent a better move for less..
8.0~Enjoyable merriman_paul Sign in Permalink Very enjoyable movie. Our younger children enjoyed it. Fun, yet not silly. A feel good movie. Only complaints; About 15 minutes too long in length, and noticed at least one blooper. Great ending and looking forward to the next one already.
9.0~Flabbergasting... Pierrot-10 Sign in Permalink This is a very cute movie, built around a love story and a teenager stepping into adulthood and discovering his own body - slightly superhuman body, that is. I think Sam Raimi (and the script writer David Koepp, who previously did a great job on Stir of Echoes) is faithful to the spirit of the Spiderman comics by focusing deliberately on the human side of the story, which is well served by a good cast - Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco - the weakest being probably Willem Dafoe, who looks so much a like a goblin anyway that he didn't have to put much effort into his part. This portrait of the superhero as a young man blends skillfully his apprenticeship as a human spider with his more common teenager concerns and love interest. The result might not be as spectacular as X-Men; on the other hand it's not trying to, but instead depicts a very human and attaching Spiderman.
7.0~skip the high tech, how bout dunst in the rain ferguson-6 Sign in Permalink Greetings again from the darkness. Disagreeing with the masses ($114 million opening weekend), I say this was quite the disappointment. It is a little confusing to note that there is a decided lack of action in a movie that also has way too many CGI graphics. Goblin's costume looked like it was directly off the Haloween shelf at Toys 'R Us. The bulk of the action was spidey swinging through the streets of the city like a kid on a jungle gym. Sam Raimi directs this to the best of his abilities, which seem to be quite limited. He is no master of storytelling. Enough bagging, let's talk positive. Kirsten Dunst may be on her way to becoming the next Julia Roberts. She has a wonderfully likeability about her and is plenty cute - just needs a touch more maturity and she should become highly sought after by movie-makers at the next level. The rain proved to be quite complimentary to Miss Dunst during one particular scene. Overall, very mediocre and I hope lessons are learned for the filming of spider-man 2.
10.0~This is an excellent film! Wow! sethn172 Sign in Permalink "Wow" is right. From when I first heard about this movie to when I actually rented the DVD (thus being the first time I've seen this movie), I thought that "Spider-Man" looked like an extreme thrill ride! Exciting from the very first minute on! And in summer of 2004, I rented the DVD, and guess what? I was right! This IS an exciting film! In fact, I've made this my favorite action film! I guess I made such an excellent decision about renting this film back in the June of 2004. Why? Because that summer, I was going to go see "Spider-Man 2" in the theater! And that was a very short time from then! I could give this 11 stars if I could (or how about 100?), but I can't, so this is a 10-star film!
10.0~the ultimate super hero love story maxdesolate Sign in Permalink the story of the geeky peter parker who attains amazing super powers after being accidentally bitten by a genetically modifed spider is all well and good to know for people who want to watch this movie...but the truth is: spider man is essentially a love story at heart. as much as you will love the way it has been adapted in to its silver screen debut with amazing special effects and superb acting, you will also feel a warmth inside your heart and feel sorry, happy, sad, excited and in the end identify yourself with the character of the innocent yet amazing peter parker. you will love him, cry for him, laugh with him and he will bring a smile to your face. that alone for me is worth this movie. what great characterization! a must watch!
10.0~Great Flick juanpepito Sign in Permalink This was probably the most accurately done comic/movie transition i have seen to date(Aside from the no web cartridge thing). I liked the fact that they didn't wimp him down like they did to the X-men in their movie. They nailed Peter Parker down with Toby McGuire. Costume was great effects were great. Willam Devoe Awesome job on the hobgoblin looking forward to seeing part 2.
7.0~Enter The Web of Spider-Man TheKarateSpider Sign in Permalink Now that enough time has lapsed since this movie was released and that the series of Sam Raimi/Tobey Maguire Spidey movies have reached an end, i feel OK to give a full, frank revue of the movie, without feeling like a stick in the mud against the universal praise the movie received on its release, and with enough nostalgia for the film as i remember it. For me the movie never quite captures the pure white heat enjoyment of the greatest Spider-Man stories from Marvel Comics. Raimi never quite gets to grips with the danger and excitement of Spideys world. Whilst the action sequences and special effects are truly awe inspiring, the world in which they are presented feels too much like a high budgeted Power Rangers remake. This is in no small part due to the glossy Production Design by Neil Spisak and the airy, breezy cinematography by Don Burgess. Both commendable by any event movie standards, but at the sake of a translation of a dangerous, fun, darker world that existed in Spider-Man comics since the 60's, 70's, 80's. Tobey Maguire gives a solid, earnest and emphatic performance as peter Parker/Spider-Man, and im sure for a whole generation Maguire will be the definitive Spider-Man actor. Spidey in this movie, and its two sequels is not the comedian with the heroic side readers of the comics are familiar with, and i think this is a potential problem. Maguire gives a sweet, innocent, driven performance as Peter Parker which clashes with his earnest portrayal as Spider-Man, unfortunately this means the character at times can come across as bland and boring. Willem Dafoe is a great choice to play Green Goblin and he does so with relish, unfortunately they completely messed up The Goblins costume, which in the battle scened with Spider-Man looks like two Action Figures in conflict. It would have been much more interesting to utilise Dafoes already Goblin like features and to have gone down a more Jekyll and Hyde road. Its the revisionist approach to the chronology of the characters that weighs the movie down. Kirsten Dunst is excellent as the girl next door Mary Jane, but it would have been better had they started with a Gwen Stacey as Spidey's first love interest, purely because the origins compared to the comics are somewhat jumbled. Danny Elfmans theme is completely uninspired, it recycles elements of his own Batman/The Flash/Darkman themes and is over lush and melodramatic, failing musically to capture the danger and excitement of Peter Parker/Spider-Mans world. For an origin story, Sam Raimi really sets up the character and story arc well. But its tantalising to think just how amazing this movie could have been, so its with excitement i look forward to 2012's Andrew Garfield starring/Marc Webb directed Spider-Man reboot, which promises to capture a real flavour of the best Spider-Man stories. Spider-Man (2002) however is a lot of fun and for an origin movie and one of the most important movies for Marvel Studios, it does its job nicely.
9.0~mostly excellent aftiel Sign in Permalink I loved this movie - 9 of 10. It's the best comic-book-originated movie I've seen, including the original Batman. And I am *not* usually a Marvel fan! "Spider-Man" is a huge, honking, major exception to my usual prejudices. Tobey Maguire is fabulous - the right mix of soulful, cheerful, and heroic. I didn't mind the modifications from the original comic book character (genetically enhanced vs. radioactive spider bite, as well as the web-glands thing) because Tobey stuck so faithfully to the idea of Petey P as a nerd's nerd. What I didn't like was the Green Goblin - Dafoe was completely overblown, and the character was so totally unnecessary. I was really disappointed because Dafoe is so great elsewhere, and he was completely wasted here. The best part of the movie for me, more than anything anything else, was seeing Petey P get used to his alter-ego - the idea of his superhero-side as a signifier for puberty and other weird changes is MUCH more interesting to me than a big technobaddie who laughs menacingly an awful lot. We could have used more of the teen angst and confusion that Maguire does so well (even though he's only 3 years younger than me...). There were some nice nods to NYC as well - remember the brouhaha that was made over the trailer that contained a web strung between the WTC towers? The writers seemed to compensate well for that - mentioning "the bombing" in passing in a boardroom scene, making it a reality as it is here in NYC today (I work downtown, and I used to work in Tower 1, so this really matters to me). Also, the one building that gets beat up in a fight scene doesn't really exist in NYC, sparing us the heartache of seeing another site get destroyed. Thirdly, of course, is a scene on the Queensboro Bridge, which I won't ruin for everyone except to say that it's a nice feel-good NYC moment - a little hokey, but much appreciated and very sorely needed. Folks in the Chelsea cinema where I saw the film cheered loudly at this bit, which was cool - we all really needed to cheer. Something else I liked was that the movie was not blatantly sexy, and was therefore VERY sexy. The upside-down kiss in the rain is worth the price of admission alone. Both Maguire and Dunst have a fresh-faced appeal that makes it *nice*, which is rather novel. I've been a fan of Maguire's since "Pleasantville", and of Dunst's since "Drop Dead Gorgeous", so it's nice to see them reacting off each other. The only adult moment happens when Dunst's dress gets awwwwful sheer in the rain - but all things considered, that's really not so bad. In short, go see it, but keep in mind that it may be scary for young kids. At the same time, it may be great for older kids who need to see a normal-nerd-as-superhero with morals and genuine charm. Now, where can I find Tobey Maguire? And convince him that 30 isn't so very old at all?
7.0~The special effects were excellent but it was too violent jugrin Sign in Permalink The movie was very good but I only rated it as a 7 because of the violence. I realize that the whole idea of the movie is good versus evil and good triumphs over evil, but the kind of violence it portrays is the kind that I believe causes young people to become insensitive to the feelings of others and to the idea of death and suffering as being the ultimate bad ending. I will not take my 10 year old son to see it because of the violence. It is the kind where the villain laughs while he visits his evil on innocent people. Movies like Jurassic Park where the violence is another species attacking man is different. It is kind of the survival on mankind, man against nature. But violence by man against man is a whole different kind and the kind that I think is bad for young minds. I would like to see more movies where man is seen as good. Where the conflict is directed in a more positive way; not just kill or be killed. Not just retaliate against violence with more violence.
7.0~Captured the essence of Spiderman pretty well ebiros2 Sign in Permalink The movie seems to be based on Spiderman issues #39 and #40 where Green Goblin captures Peter Parker and reveals to him that he is actually Norman Osborne, Parker's room mate Harry Osbourne's father. Director Sam Raime focused on one of the most intriguing episode of early Spiderman series, and he was right on target with choosing Spiderman's most colorful arch enemy into the first Spiderman movie. If there was bit of a stretch was Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker and Kirstin Dunst as Mary Jane Watson. Peter Parker is a hard core New Yorker, and Tobey Maguire really didn't look like he's from New York at all, and Mary Jane Watson is supposed to be a real happy go lucky "Me Generation" type individual, not a muted Gen X character portrayed by Dunst. Also, role of Liz Allan (Somewhat of a love interest to Peter in high school) and Mary Jane seems to be merged into one character. Given that Spiderman is not an easy character to bring to the big screen, overall the movie captured the essence of Spiderman pretty well. If they portrayed the people around Peter Parker bit more in detail to bring out the kind of world he lives in the movie would have been even better, but for a first try, it was pretty darn good.
8.0~I Can Live With This...... The_Sun_Toucher Sign in Permalink It's finally here. Most of us hardcore fans have already seen it at least twice. We've spent the last two years visiting our favorite movie sites daily, devouring all of the latest "updates". We've debated even the most minute details in chat rooms and on message boards like these. But after the credits roll, after we come down from the initial high of seeing our favorite web-slinger finally swing across the silver screen, How does "Spider-Man" measure up? Is it the great comic book adaption we've been waiting for? "Spider-Man" is quite enjoyable, to be sure. One of the more enjoyable "summer blockbusters" I've seen in sometime. While it delivers quite well in terms of sheer entertainment value, it's not without it's flaws. I'm guessing it will be about as popular as the first "Batman" at the Box-office, and will probably inspire just as much debate. In Sam Riami, we have a director who is not only Knowledgeable about the mythology of the title character, but who is more than suited for this type of material. Sam directs from a script by David Keopp that is surprisingly faithful to the origins of the character. Sam and David make an interesting choice in that they don't take the subject matter deadly seriously, as Tim Burton did with Batman. They approach spidey with a sense of the absurd, allowing moments of slapstick to find their way into some of the films key action set-pieces (Peter's outrageous wrestling costume was a particularly nice touch). This is sometimes to the detriment of the fight scenes in terms of believability. Sam brings a 50's B-movie sensibility to the material that makes the proceedings a little more fun than they might have been, had Sam and company taken the ever-trendy "Dark" approach that is so prevelent with films of this type. It is obvious that this is a film crafted by people who adore this character. During the scenes where spidey swings through the canyon's of Manhatten, the film itself seems almost in awe of him. If the films CGI effects weren't so obvious, maybe that feeling would've translated a little better, but no matter. The scenes are basically what they should be. We also get a very sympathetic Peter Parker in Tobey Maguire. Could someone else have done better? Maybe, but I'm more than content with the version of Peter presented here. I only wish that Spidey himself were a little more interesting. We never get any insight as to the change Peter undergoes when he puts on the mask. One of the more disappointing aspects of the film is that it has no distinct visual look of it's own. Compared to "Blade 2", "Spider-Man" feels rather subdued and generic. Even more so when you consider that this was directed by the same man who made "The Evil Dead" films. As an adaption, Spider-Man gets an 8 out of 10. As a film, I give it a 7. Is it what we've been waiting for? Yes and no. Is it that best adaption ever? No. Richard Donner's Superman still holds that distinction, but's a damn sight better than any of the Batman films.
7.0~Along Came a Spider wes-connors Sign in Permalink Not as good as the best "Superman" and "Batman" movies, but better than the worst. "Spider-Man" has one of the best origin stories in comics; and, much of it hits the big screen intact. What makes the story of downtrodden young Peter Parker's transformation into the extraordinary "Spider-Man" so memorable it's the fateful decision he makes NOT to use his new powers to stop a criminal, early in his career. Later, he learns "with great power comes great responsibility." The impact of this powerful lesson in heroism is a little diluted by the addition of the "Green Goblin", and other alterations, into the preliminaries. It's still a powerful story. The film's main weakness is it's descent into near cartoon state for much of the "Spider-Man" and "Green Goblin" action. After Tobey Maguire (as Peter Parker aka Spider-Man) and Willem Dafoe (as Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin) successfully bring their characters to life, they are "re-animated"; however exciting, the special effects dehumanize the characters. The "Green Goblin" story is not as effectively told as in the comics; but, the arch enemy father (Mr. Dafoe) and best friend son James Franco (as Harry Osborn) are well cast. Director Sam Raimi works some marvels. Nice to hear Spider-Man say the magic word, "Shazam!" and hear Rosemary Harris (as Aunt May) tell him, "You're not Superman, you know." Nice to see Cliff Robertson (as Uncle Ben). And, leading woman Kirsten Dunst (as Mary Jane "M.J." Watson) is very sexy wet. ******* Spider-Man (2002) Sam Raimi ~ Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst
8.0~Good movie Brad2002 Sign in Permalink While no movie can match the hype it generates, this movie is still pretty good. The movie follows the beginnings of Spider-Man ( I hate the hyphen ) and his ultimate battle with The Goblin, played very well by Willem Defoe. Of course, the special effects take center stage and basically make the movie and we see some of the best special effects ever done in a movie to date. The movie, overall, measures up to the best of the comic book super hero movies and, if nothing else, a very entertaining way to spend a couple hours. If you enjoy these type of movies, you won't be disappointed. I only had a couple of problems with the movie. One, the action sequences were often so quick you couldn't really get a good look at Spider-Man. Two, as Peter Parker, Tobey Maquire was near perfectly cast, but as Spider-Man, he left something to be desired. It was the voice. That squeeky voice works fine as Peter Parker, but, as in the classic cartoon, with the mask on, his voice should have sounded deeper and more manly like. This would have been very easy to do by using a voice over with another actor with a similar but deeper sounding voice. Many die hard Spider-Man fans were disappointed, also, with the web shooter, which in the movie was the result of a mutation from the radioactive spider. I had no problem with that and thought it was, actually, a good idea. Anyway, if you see it with the right expectation, a live action version of a cartoon, and have enjoyed those types of movies in the past, you'll like this one quite a lot.
9.0~Fun! willrams Sign in Permalink When being bitten by a genetically modified spider a nerdy highschool student becomes like a spider with great power which he uses to fight evil and becomes a superhero. Played by Toby Maguire as Peter Parker, he is magificent and mobile and really extends his superpowers for all. I still remain a kid and thought this a great film - much better than Superman, and totally enjoyable. 9/10
9.0~A real feel-good movie elrenno Sign in Permalink It has all the elements of a classic movie: The struggle of good vs. evil, The underdog turned hero, Boy gets the girl (well, maybe not). I give it two big thumbs up. The choice of Toby Maguire was an excellent one. He added just the right flare to the role. And Willem Dafoe makes for such a wicked bad guy. My only complaint was that some of the special effects were a bit too much. They used a CG Spiderman a bit too often. Other than that, it had a terrific story line. It was told very effectively. And, having heard through interviews that Toby Maguire has already signed to do two more Spiderman movies, the lead-in to the next movie was blatantly obvious. In short, the movie's well worth the time and money. I especially liked the ending. I had heard that they had to rework a few scenes following 9/11. One of them becomes very clear as Spiderman does a "fly-by" at the end of the movie past a very large American flag atop the Empire State Building. Go see this movie!
10.0~Excellent movie! Deadite Ash Sign in Permalink I just saw this movie a few hours ago and I must say that this was an excellent movie! Well what can you expect from a Sam Raimi film? You got your action, comedy, drama, and of course the usual Raimi corniness. They couldn't have done better with this film. If you're going to see a film at the theater, forget The Scorpion King, Changing Lanes, or Jason X, go see this! Definetely one of the most satisfying pictures out now!
10.0~One of the best films I've ever seen! q43z Sign in Permalink It's without a doubt the best film out this year. It keeps you gripped from the moment you see the opening credits, right through to the line "Who am I? I'm Spiderman!' Some people say if you read the comics as a kid then this film lets you down. I say it portrays Spiderman in the best possible way. It deals with the way in which a teenager would deal with these new powers! He shows off and has a little fun. It's packed full of action and has a great cast! A definite 10/10!
7.0~Good, but does not live up to the hype. katana_one Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is my all-time favorite super hero. I read the comics religiously as a teenager. I was very apprehensive about a big-screen adaptation. All the ads made the costume look cheesy, the Goblin looked really lame, and they made his web-shooters "built-in". After watching the film, I have to say that I enjoyed it. It was not as bad as I had expected, in fact, it was actually pretty good. It is worth seeing (even if it drags a bit in the middle), but I don't think it deserves the rave reviews it is getting.
10.0~A Good Movie in its Own Right illjwamh Sign in Permalink Whether you're a die-hard long time fan of Spidey like me, or you don't even know who Peter Parker is, you will enjoy this movie. That's because while this is an incredibly accurate adaptation of the classic Marvel comic, it is also just a very well made movie. The characters all interact beautifully, which is in part due to the spectacular performances by Maguire, Dafoe and Dunst. Also, although his part was small, J.K. Simmons did a hilariously wonderful job of portraying the pig-headed J. Jonah Jameson. In addition, there is something for everyone in this movie. It's not overloaded with action scenes, as some may fear, and it has enough to satisfy those who desire such. The special effects were amazing, despite a few obvious instances of a CGI Spidey, and the fight scenes were very fun to watch. The only thing I wished there had been more of were Spidey's wise cracks. Nothing is more enjoyable than his sarcastic banter with the super-villains. However, there was enough to keep me happy. All in all, this is a great movie no matter what kind of movies you like. I've seen it twice already in just the first three days, and I plan on seeing it again.
9.0~A good dose of web-swinging fun. louwburger-42312 Sign in Permalink Not only does Spider-Man provide a good dose of web-swinging fun, it also has a heart, thanks to the combined charms of director Sam Raimi and star Tobey Maguire.
5.0~Flashy CGI cannot account for script flaws MyDarkStar Sign in Permalink With Hollywood fully embracing CGI special-effects, and the audiences eating it up like the Twizzlers from the concession stand, the stage was definitely set for one of the most visually challenging comic book interpretations in film history. Spider-Man is not an easy character to put on screen. He doesn't simply fly through the air to his destination. He swings from one web to another, sticking to walls, jumping towards open windows, and grabbing whatever he has to grab in the mean time. The Green Goblin himself is difficult, riding on a jet-coaster that hovers and shoots off at great speeds, as well as fire a large arsenal of weapons. With this said, the special effects were impressive. Sure, they looked kind of cartoon-y at times, but hey, after-all it's a comic-book interpretation, right ? It wasn't the special effects that disappointed me in this movie. It was other elements. When I first heard that Willem Dafoe would be playing the role of the Norman Osborn\Green Goblin, I was excited. Here was an actor who had the talent to pull off the role, and the sinister grin to keep it consistent with the comic-book character. However, and this is important, there's a plot alteration in the movie that makes it different from the comic-book. Because Norman Osborn is trying for a military contract for body armor, the Green Goblin ends up wearing this armor and a helmet\mask throughout the movie. This ends up making him look like a Power Ranger on a gliding coaster ! Worst, it doesn't allow us to see that sinister grin that Willem Defoe has. The same grin that initially got me excited about him getting the part ends up being molded on the front of a plastic mask - and the viewer doesn't get to see Dafoe as the Green Goblin, only Harry Osborn. Dafoe's Green Goblin had potential to be better than Nicholson's Joker, before they put a mask on the Green Goblin. Even worst, it introduces a very bad plot hole : Wouldn't you think the military would know the true identity of the Green Goblin upon sight, if he is flying around in recently military-demonstrated body armor ? That is a VERY big flaw in the script !! One of the pleasant surprises in the movie was J.K. Simmons' performance as J. Jonah Jameson. He played the role perfectly, right down to the toupee.
9.0~Lots of fun shawndevin Sign in Permalink This is a very fun movie. Quite enjoyable. The biggest problem is that the 'romantic' dialog at the end of the movie has got to be the worst I have ever heard in any movie bar none. They tried setting us up to believe the scene with events happening in the movie, but it just doesn't fly. I would say the movie is a 'must see' for the summer, just close your ears at the end of the movie so you don't hear the lousy dialog in the 'tender moment' at the end. Apart from that, the movie really is lots of fun to watch! :o)
10.0~Spider-Fun Flwreden Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is great for the whole family. Tobey is Peter Parker and Willem is the goblen. I think it's a 9 out 10 . With both action, drama and more. If you have the chance to see it.Go for it.It sort of has the Superman/Batman feel over wanting to see comic book hero's. Let's hope that the Hulk in 03' can top this movie.
7.0~One of the great movie ever my seen. melissarmcdougall Sign in Permalink I was never a comic book kid growing up. But this is the film that turned me around on Comic-Book- Movies. It's hard to believe that this film is 12 years old now, and that Comic Book movies are the most blockbusters these days. Even tho this film is a little dated, it holds up great with other movies, even compared with the newest films out there. This is a great movie, it tells the story at a nice pace, and there is also something interesting to look at on screen, from the swooping camera angles, to the action and the love scenes. The movie Spider-Man is with a lot of fun for everyone.
5.0~One of the Better Comic Book Adaptions but not as good as the hype suggests med_1978 Sign in Permalink I would like to say firstly I am not a Comic Book nut and have in fact hardly read any. But I do like Comic Book/Superhero Movies. Having seen a great many Comic Book Characters/SuperHeroes/Vigilantes brought to the big & small screens such as Darkman, The Flash, Batman, Spawn, X-Men, The Hulk, The Crow, Superman etc. I must say I did enjoy Spiderman and it was slightly better than I anticipated. I remembered seeing re-runs of the Nicholas Hammond TV Series in the late eighties when I was a teenager and thought them OK but a bit lame. I am not a fan of any of the Stars in Spiderman either (although I think Willem Dafoe is a good actor). I found myself thoroughly entertained from beginning to end, however that is all this movie is ENTERTAINMENT. The fact that Peter Parker is bitten by the Spider in the beginning and no-one else is, is a little hard to swallow, why does it not bite other people then we could have loads of Spidermen!(in reality spiders mostly keep away from people). But if you don't think about the what if's etc. and go along for the ride it thoroughly entertaining fast paced fun. There are the usual clichés, the mad scientist who must test his work on himself resulting in changes of mood and eventually becoming the villain (see The Fly & Hollow Man for other examples of this), the fight with the School Bully, and the ending is predictable. I found the romantic Scenes between Tobey Maguire & Kirsten Dunst to be surprisingly the best parts of the film, and also the scenes where Willem Dafoe's personality is being taken over by his alter ego The Green Goblin. Tobey Maguire's performance as Peter Parker was completely believable and having now seen him in the role I couldn't imagine anyone else playing it better, Kirsten Dunst was good as Mary Jane, I also though James Franco was good as Parker's friend and unbeknown to him the son of the principal villain Willem Dafoe, whose performance was as usual very good although a little over the top as the Goblin but this is the norm I guess with this type of film. I also thought Cliff Robertson was okay in his small part. I prefer darker comic book films and found The Crow, Batman (1989), Batman Returns and X-men to be better films. This Film is however is WAY BETTER than all the overrated Superman films (far too much humour)and The Hulk, Batman Forever, Batman and Robin, Catwoman, The Punisher, Daredevil, Elektra & Sam Raimi's own Darkman + all The Crow sequels. I would give this film 5 1/2 or 6 out of 10
7.0~Spiderman A Good Comic Book Movie With Some Flaws tburke85 Sign in Permalink Spider-man is a good comic book movie with some flaws. I prefer the sequel over this one but the original is still a solid comic book film brought to life by director Sam Raimi and the talented cast. Raimi does a decent enough job telling the origin story of nerdy high schooler Peter Parker into the web slinging superhero Spider-man. The cast includes Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-man, William Dafoe as Norman Osburne/The Green Goblin, Kristen Dunst as Mary Jane Watson, and James Franco as Harry Osbourne. Maguire is admirable in his role as both Peter Parker and Spider-man giving us character who is nerdy but is willing to put others before himself. He's a teenager with problems and I think thats why people can identify with him. He's also a man in love with his beautiful neighbor Mary Jane Watson. Dunst as Mary Jane is okay as Peters love but isn't really given much to do besides eventually being the damsel in distress later on in the film. William Dafoe is impressive as Norman Osbourne and his evil alter ego The Green Goblin. I like the fact they made the Goblin a split personality a side effect of the performance enhancers his character takes in the movie. His costume did look a little corny and it resembled something you'd see in an episode of Power Rangers or something but Dafoe makes for an imposing villain none the less. James Franco is good as Norman's son Harry but like Dunst he isn't given much to do either except to show up here and there throughout the movie. Rosemary Harris as Aunt May and Cliff Robertson in a small role as Uncle Ben are effective supporting characters. They both have good chemistry with Maguire making them believable as his characters aunt and uncle. Bruce Campbell has a brief appearance as a wresting announcer and he makes the best of his small part in the film. The special effects are state of the art and the action/fight sequences are well executed but at times you can definitely tell is CG which is okay but not as good as when you see two worthy adversaries without costumes duking it out instead of something created in a computer. The pacing in between the action was a little slow and the dialogue wasn't the best at times. Overall though Spider-man is still an entertaining comic book with just the right amount of action, some suspense, humor, a little romance, and solid performances by the cast that make for an enjoyable movie to watch.
10.0~Very good Wetchik888 Sign in Permalink This movie was very good for two reasons. First, the graphics were brilliant. They were so good I could not even notice it. Second, the plot was amazing. If I was a writer for a movie, I probably would not think of those ideas. Those are the main reasons I liked that movie.
8.0~Very, Very Good LMBeth Sign in Permalink I am not the biggest comic book fan. In fact, the few comic books I have picked up in my life have been Star Wars related, but even I know a good movie when I see one. Spider-Man is a great movie! Between the action and the suspense is the feeling and heart that makes it the kind of movie just begging for a sequel. That, and the, ohh, about a THOUSAND hints they dropped at the end that we should expect more to come. Tobey Maquire is wonderful as Peter/Spidey, showing the heart behind the hero and keeping the sadness and weight right there with the fun. Kirsten Dunst, while not my favorite actress, was wonderful, and the chemistry between the two was believable and one of the best parts of the movie. Willem Defoe was AMAZING as Normon/Goblin, especially in his...well, I'm not going to give away anything... The movie moved when it needed to and let you breath when you needed to. Mr. Raimi should be congratulated on a good film that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good time!
5.0~Not THAT great ellingbja Sign in Permalink I just finished watching this movie, and I have to say it's not THAT great. Not as great as I thought maybe it should be after hearing the critics. There are some nice touches to it, and Tobey Maguire plays the lead role very well. But the story itself is not very intriguing or captivating. About as intriguing as the comic books themselves are, I suspect. Except I have not actually read any of the comic books, so I wouldn't really know. I guess this movie is great if you love the comic books, or if you love similar types of super-hero stories. But if you have no special care for those, then I suspect you'll find this movie only slightly above average.
7.0~A bit of a letdown... brettlu Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is a fun movie, but it's just a little too contrived (even for comic book material). It's an interesting take on the original story in regards to the script and direction. And I thought Willem Dafoe and Toby Maguire did a good job given the somewhat cheesy material. A few fun cameos also appear such as Randy Savage, Bruce Cambell, Lucy Lawless and Stan Lee. This isn't the best comic book movie ever made, but it's definitely not the worst. The main thing that takes away from the movie is that it can be pretty unrealistic (yes, even taking into consideration that it's a comic book movie). I give it *** out of four stars...
7.0~Green Goblin: "What's my motivation?" RolloTomasi Sign in Permalink The first half of "Spider-Man" really is perfect. It's everything you could hope for in a comic book movie. It's lighthearted, yet dramatic, as well as exciting. It is the reason to go see it. The film also has problems that any this huge, with this much at stake, is likely to have. Some are merely inconsistencies with the comic, which I can't argue with. For one, Peter fires the webbing out of his wrists, which he never did in the comic. In the comic, he fits his costume with web-shooters that fire super strong webbing. But having the webs fire from his own wrists in the film creates some nice comic moments and is more economical, story-wise, than having manufactured web shooters. So this is easily excused. In true comic-book fashion, the hero and the villain are created nearly simultaneously, in completely unrelated events. I was able to shun this aside as well. That's just a Hollywood coincidence and is consistent with comic storytelling. Another aspect of the comic that the film misses is Spider-Man's sarcastic sense of humor. In the comic, in even the most dire situations, Spider-Man always found some wise-crack, which was sometimes just to hide his own fear. It's like trash talk, of the NBA variety. This is one of the most appealing and unique aspects about the Spider-Man character and the film barely touches on it. The film runs into real problems, though, with the Green Goblin (and I don't mean the problems he causes Spider-Man). Norman Osborn's mental breakdown, triggered by his business failings, is well represented by Willem Dafoe. The performance is great, but it doesn't look like he was allowed to have any fun, the way Jack Nicholson was as the Joker, Michelle Pfiefer as Cat Woman, and Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor. Even Ian McKellen as Magneto (in "X-Men") looked like he savored every moment of that role. But the Goblin of "Spider-Man" is just an extreme version of every character Dafoe's ever played (I had this flashback of "Shadow of the Vampire" when Osborn gasps upon seeing the blood on Peter's arm in the Thanksgiving scene). There's nothing surprising about the character, nor any moments that let you know the film isn't taking itself too seriously. A film like this needs to show that it is aware of its own triviality, something usually done through the villain. Sam Raimi doesn't get this. That isn't even the film's biggest flaw. This flaw could have been fixed with one or two small changes and would have made a huge difference. The Goblin's motivation for wanting to kill Spider Man-what is it? The film never gives a convincing one. Even a comic book movie needs this. For some reason, writer David Koepp has the Goblin decide that Spider-Man can't be beat (he's "virtually invincible"), so he asks the hero to join him to do what, exactly? When Spider-Man refuses, the Goblin gets angry and tries to kill him. He goes after his family and friends just to bait him. This concept is just, well, dumb. For one thing, the whole appeal of the Spider-Man character as a superhero is that he IS vulnerable. He does have superhuman strength, but bullets can hurt him. He can be killed by things that would kill normal people, like bullets and fire. All he has going for him is his spider-sense, his strength, his agility. Another point: this vendetta of the Goblin's isn't even consistent with the Norman Osborn character Koepp had built up to that point. Osborn is a guy who blames other people, homicidally, for his own failings. He doesn't get the DOD contract and kills the men who said no to him. Spider-Man saying no didn't make any difference one way or the other. It didn't cause any failing on Osborn's part. Now, if Spider-Man had caused the Goblin to fail in some way, or stood in his way and created the perception that it was Spider-Man's fault, well, that would have been a different story. As it is, though, this lack of motivation leaves a huge hole through the middle of the movie. At least for me. Grade: B-
10.0~AMAZING!!! ibrahimrizwan Sign in Permalink This is certainly the best super hero movie i have seen yet,really amazing!Everything the script,cast,effects,were all good.I really enjoyed watching this movie.I think the director has done a remarkable job.The only thing i don't understand is why they changed a few things for example the web-shooters.
10.0~The best comic film since the original Superman. midnighttheater Sign in Permalink Stylize and faithful adaptation of the Marvel comic hero is nothing short of breathtaking. Sam Raimi does the classic Marvel Comics hero justice with a powerful and touching film that will be a hallmark for comic books films to come. Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast as Peter Parker, The tragic young hero who learns about responsibility the hard way, and Willem Dafoe is perfect as the villain, whose sacrifices every thing to achieve personal power. The movie is a slick reminder on how comic book movie should be made, and it does it with the right combination of heart and fireworks. The rest of the cast is just as fine and the special effects really do pack a hell of a punch to the senses. Can't wait for Spidey 2.
5.0~I was very underwhelmed by this movie. davehbrown Sign in Permalink Hmm. After all the money this thing took in at the box office, I was expecting something a lot more impressive. The movie was badly paced (stuff happened WAY too fast) and populated with a bunch of characters that I didn't care about. During the "touching, emotional" scenes, I just felt bored. The acting ranged from novice to just plain bad: "I swear on my father's grave, Spiderman will pay for what he did." As far as comic book to movie adaptations go, this thing was a little better than, say, "Judge Dredd" or "Batman and Robin". But it fell way short of "Blade", "Men in Black", or "Superman".
1.0~what? brutalpink Sign in Permalink I don't understand how this movie made the top 250, although it wasn't awful, it was boring, unoriginal and appalling as far as special effects go. Far more enthralling, poignant and visually impressive films have been made on a shoe string budget. Most of the acting was respectable, especially from Dafoe who went a long way with his limited time on-screen and one-dimensional character (like most of the others) but Kirsten Dunst? I don't care if her simplicity makes her good for the character, I see no chemistry between her and Maguire. This movie was a big disappointment. What a waste of talent and vision from Maguire and the once great Raimi.
6.0~Come on, it wasn't THAT great. fullercramden Sign in Permalink As one of the most anticipated movies of the past few decades, fans (myself included) were really holding their breath for a phenominal film. Now that it's finally out, people are giving it all sorts of praise, but come on, it was OK, but there have been better comic book movies, such as the first Batman or even X-Men. For those of us that know the origin story, the first half of the movie was all familiar territory, but it was still somewhat entertaining. I felt like the major flaw in the film was the introduction and use of the Green Goblin, I felt like he was underdeveloped and uninteresting. Once he avenged the corporate downfall of Norman Osborn, he just wanted to blow stuff up for the sake of mayhem. Then he fought Spider-Man a few times, including once where he knocked him unconscious and didn't bother to take his mask off (what??). The reason I think both Batman and X-Men were better films is because the characters, villains especially, were more developed, more interesting, and took more interesting courses of action. Perhaps I would think Spider-Man is a great film if I was ten years younger, but today I have to give it the old "OK" rating.
9.0~Spins circles around other superhero movies! cinemaniac1942 Sign in Permalink 9/10 stars (includes what could be construed as minor spoilers - but I'll tell ya when) "Spider-Man" is one of the all-time greatest action-adventure movies. It delivers in all departments a good summer blockbuster should: thrills, laughs, tears, jolts, shivers, you name it. "Spider-Man" delivers. Definitely one of the best cinematic thrill-rides ever. When I first learned the principle cast (Maguire, Dafoe, Dunst), I did not see any of them fitting their roles at all. I thought Maguire too whimpy, and I thought Dafoe would ham his role up too much. Well, Dunst was good enough to please me, though she isn't the best choice for MJ. But Maguire and Dafoe were perfect. Two of the best performances ever in this kind of movie, and great performances by any genre standard. Nobody else could play the title role; Tobey Maguire IS Spider-Man! His whimpy-ness actually enhanced his performance. And Dafoe had to be a little hammy to pull off that outrageous costume and personality, but he did so without becoming annoying. He was hammy when necessary but sadistic and despicable when necessary too. Pacing was flawless, and direction was close to it. The music was excellent, if not reminiscent of Elfman's other great superhero score for the 1989 "Batman." The special effects were better than expected, and the action was exceptionally choreographed. I allowed for suspending disbelief on some issues and let the usual corny comic-book hero-villain banter pass. After all, this is a comic-book movie. And actually, every frame looks like a comic book frame, an amazing achievement in directing. And the script is superior to other comic-book movies. The only other comic book movies that are comparatively excellent are 1990's "Dick Tracy" and 1991's "The Rocketeer." "X-Men" another great Marvel movie, comes excruciatingly close. And "Batman" (1989) will always be a comic-book movie classic, even if it is overly violent. (The rest of the "Batman" movies are..y'know what, I won't even get started on those abominations.) (OK, though not real spoilers, you may wanna skip this paragraph) I gave a 9 only because a 10 seems like a flawless score. 9 seems about equal to a four-star rating though. Only 3 real flaws I saw: the CGI is REALLY obvious at one or two parts; the dialogue gets overly corny at one or two parts (the New Yorkers on the bridge, for instance?); and MJ's little (little?) speech at the end sounds like a script reading. But these are minor flaws in an otherwise perfect film. Thank you, thank you, thank you Sam Raimi and friends, you've strengthened my faith that, yes, truly great effects movies do exist, and you've done better than I dreamed. And I'm an even bigger Spidey fan now. Give us "Spider-Man 2" PLEASE!!!!!
10.0~Icing on the cake Pretzyl Sign in Permalink Sure the adaptation from comic to movie was near perfect, yes the cast portrayed the infamous characters with exceptional accuracy (especially to J.K. Simmons' Jameson), and the long-time-spiderman-fan Sam Raimi's direction helped to steer this production away from the fates that other superhero genre films have fallen victim to time and time again. All of this is a given... no, what put this movie over the top for me was hearing that signature Spiderman cartoon theme song tagged along with the end credits. Enough said! Plus... 2 friends and I are in the audience of the Bone-Saw wrestling scene (now all that's left to do is to wait for the DVD to freeze-frame our way to fame and world-wide recognition!).
8.0~Good movie *Spoilers* say_hi Sign in Permalink This movie was awesome the first time I saw it, but when you watch it again you can pick apart the movie. First of all, the wrestling promoter should know who Spider-man really is and all the people at that festival should be able to identify Spider-man because he tore his shirt off in the middle of everyone. Still, the special effects were awesome and the story was very good so the movie wasn't all bad. Good movie with big plot holes. A better comic-to-movie adaptation to watch is Daredevil or X2. Rating: 7/10
10.0~Words cannot express... JessicaBrandy Sign in Permalink ...the wonder that is this movie. If I say that I enjoyed this movie, then I would be a liar. If I said that this movie was awesome, then I am not doing this movie the justice that it deserves. See Spiderman, and see it in the theaters. If you do not, then you will regret it for the rest of your life. And if you're one of those wacko's that has a really big TV and surround sound and try to convince yourself that it will be just as good, or even better then seeing it in the theaters, then you are wrong, retarded, and should be committed. The only way that you will convince me that you will get the full effect is if you own your own projector, 100 ft screen, and stadium seating. All I have to say is thank goodness this movie waited...thank goodness there were conflicting parties who claimed ownership...because of this, the movie was delayed and then made at a time where CG is at its peak and there are no cheesy strings or obvious scenes where the wall is actually the ground (i.e.. Batman and Robin walking up the buildings...blah). Yeah, I liked this movie.
1.0~Piotr St. says: CRAP! CRAP! CRAP!!! 807 Sign in Permalink Omigosh!!!! How can ANYONE give this film more than 3 (except from TY and WD fans) remains a mystery for me. First of all this one is FOR LITTLE CHILDREN ONLY. I know that comic books adaptations are not meant to be, say, A Clockwork Orange, but do yourself a favor and go watch Batman (1989) - it's a great pleasure. Thanks to great director and of course Mr. Nicholson. And it still stands well: its dark mood, photography, and dark poetry have transcended well into 2002. In comparison this one is simply pathetic. Only special effects, and wery weak, naive screenplay. Why do you Americans take us all as fvols?! Spider-Man is a deadly boring movie: I watched this at a cinema and everybody was loudly laughing anytime when "...with great power comes great responsibility blah blah blah..." came from the screen. Many people left before the film has ended, saying "LAME!", or "Crap". There is nothing new, we have seen many films of superheroes and this one is simply re-make of all cliches you can imagine. I can't understand why this one earned so many money: I think it was because there were no good releases at the same time. If released together with Attack Of The Clones, this would hit the bottom faster than Titanic did. Not worth any minute of your life. 1/10 - just because there is no 0.
9.0~"Wondrous To Behold" TheNamelessNobody Sign in Permalink Ever since the dreaded "Batman & Robin" movie screened up in 1997, Moviegoers criticized it over and over, until we were left with one question: can superhero movies ever be good again? The answer was yes. Director Sam Raimi (Notable for his work on the horror films "The Evil Dead" And "Army Of Darkness") stepped inside Sony Pictures Entertainment to answer that question. Together, they created what was widely considered to be the best superhero movie series yet: Spider-Man. For starters, this movie handles the Spider-Man origin story very smoothly. From the spider bite to Uncle Ben's death, no other superhero movie can top the origin story better than this one. Now let's talk about acting. We've got Tobey Maguire playing Peter Parker/Spider-Man, and I say he does a great job with it. Raimi's Peter Parker displays the nerd inside but also showing a shy side to girls, even Mary Jane Watson (Kristen Dunst) - the girl Peter loves the most. Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) does his work but after a human body experiment his personality goes full villain. Thus creating his alter ego "The Green Goblin" how Raimi handles the goblin is somewhat the best I've heard of from Dafoe so far. And now, let's talk about special effects - brought to you by Sony Pictures Imageworks. I've heard from some reviews that the special effects were kind of shaky, and I agree. But the special effects here are pretty well done - from blue screening to excellent CGI, You could tell that was hard work for all the people working for the special effects department. Peter's relationship with Mary Jane Watson somewhat ties in with the original comics, if you're a comic book expert that is. But i don't understand why MJ is somewhat hated throughout, she's always put into a "damsel in distress" situation in ALL 3 MOVIES. But I can mostly ignore that, MJ is always the girl Peter/Spidey wants to save the most because Peter cares about MJ, she's his love life, and MJ always loved Peter since the first day they got together. Saving people is Peter's duties as Spider-Man. Oh, and who wouldn't forget Peter Parker's friendship with Harry Osborn (James Franco), Norman's son? It seems to start here, but grows bigger and until Harry thinks Peter/Spider-Man killed his father and later becomes the new goblin in the third film. But i'm glad he realizes Norman Osborn/Green Goblin actually killed himself because of his own glider. How can someone who has been the son of a villain blame their friend, who is a superhero, for something that wasn't entirely their fault? But I guess that's Harry Osborn for you all. And the CGI - oh my god. The way they handled the CGI in this movie is really realistic. Spider-Man's CG model is really accurate to the real one, done throughout all 3 movies - perfect. And overall, what do I say about this movie? Fantastic. Spider-Man really captures the comic book spirit of a movie adaptation through the entire movie, with great actors, great story, great special effects/CGI, and great everything else. This movie really sets up the gold standard for superhero movies old and new. And remember - With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility.

7.0~cool nuffsaid-1 Sign in Permalink the goblin looked like a toy or something but who cares i was entertained It would have been better, if ilm had done the cgi for this film cos it looks bad man and if you look at what ilm can do ...well we all know ilm would have made it look real good but ya can't have everything a well deserved 7
1.0~worst movie of this century kjartman Sign in Permalink I came out of the cinema feeling like I had been robbed for $7. This movies is so awful it's a disgrace to the art of movie making. Dafoe as a green goblin???!!! Don't expect anything but cheesy lines and a weak plot. I guess I'm overreacting slightly.. after all this is a movie for kids. "with great power, comes great responsibility" ... oh my. goosebumbs down my spine... thats how bad this movie was. It's sad to see good actors like dunst, toby M and dafoe sink to these levels. I never liked hollywood blockbusters anyway, so I did expect to see a lousy movie, but i was flabbergasted over the intensity of the cheese levels. dont waste your time with this flick. ugh 1/10
7.0~A Real Swinger rlcsljo Sign in Permalink Raimi, more than any other director, has almost perfectly captured the style and grace of Spider Man, especially when he swings around on his web going from building to building. He also does a great job of capturing his grace of motion while doing gymnastics and fighting--but that is about it! He does almost nothing to capture the youth angst that the original SpiderMan conveyed in the comic books. This may mostly be because the three main characters just seem to be phoning in the lines. After seeing Jonah Jameson, I prayed for the time when he would be back on screen (this character was captured perfectly!). Hopefully in future installments, the movie will take place more at the Bugle and we can see more of him. I hope Aunt May doesn't die soon, as she also did a fairly competent job of capturing the sweetness of the comic book character. Except for the web slinging and Kirsten Dunst in her occasional short skirts, there is not much else here. Can't they find someplace else in New York to have a showdown, except for the Brooklyn Bridge? P.S. Fire the cinematographer! "Depth of Focus" does not seem to be in his vocabulary!
10.0~Is this a great movie or what? Rev Tim Benjamin Sign in Permalink There may be a spoiler or two here. This movie was spectacular. I was excited when I heard they were doing a Spiderman movie. I knew it would be cool with lots of special effects and cool fight scenes, but I had no idea the movie would be as full as this one was. I understood why the Green Goblin was blowing things up, it wasn't just mindless mayhem. I knew why Spiderman had the obsession with helping the innocent, not just because he was a good person. I felt terrible when Uncle Ben died. At the end, I wanted MJ and Peter Parker to get together. Toby McGuire was great, but Willem Dafoe just about stole the show. This movie was movie-making magic at its best.
10.0~Unbelievable action; great movie for all notacrook29 Sign in Permalink I've been a fan of Spider-Man since kindergarten, so, needless to say, I loved the movie. It had the origin story perfect, minus the organic web-shooters, and a great story for the movie. There were a lot of creative, but subtle touches throughout the movie that made it especially entertaining to watch. Non-fans can enjoy this movie as easily as life-fans of Spider-Man, and I highly recommend it to ALL people--in the theater there were children, teens, adults and even elderly people clearly enjoying the whole thing. See it. See it twice. And then again.
10.0~GREAT FUN!!! Richiep2029 Sign in Permalink "Amazing" is all I can say about this movie. IT has eveything, its funny good action, wonderful effects and in my opinion really good acting. Tobey Maguire IS Peter Parker, Kirsten Dunst is wonderful as MJ and Willem Dafoe is evil as hell as The Green Goblin. All in all great fun lets hope we see the Black Cat in Spidey II
10.0~Fantastic!!!!! spec-4 Sign in Permalink Smiled every minute of the movie. If you don't like this movie there's something wrong with you. Either that or you just hate comic book heroes, in which case I don't know why you'd see the movie any way. Raimi - way to go!!!!!
10.0~Enjoyable comic book adaption l_three_Three_seven Sign in Permalink It may have its problems but, i would not look that far in to it and just enjoy the show. But really, when will directors learn that every new action movie does not need a 'matrix' scene to be successful? enough is enough.. No more slow-motion-ducking-the-projectile-then-barely-get-nicked scene. Oh.. and i have to mention, i thought i saw a boom mic creep in to the top of two different shots.. though i was most likely just seeing things there. Now that i had my little self-contradicting rant, go see the movie and enjoy one of the best comic book movie adaptations ever.
8.0~This movie is amazing InvisableMirages Sign in Permalink I've always liked super-heroes like Spiderman, Superman, and Batman. And I've always loved action films. So I went to the theaters to see it. I came out with a huge grin on my face. Well worth the $6.50 I paid. The movie starts out at the beginning of the first Spiderman Comic. With Peter Parker (played by the talented Tobey Maguire) getting bit by the spider and transforming into Spiderman. Peter is in love with the beautiful Mary Jane (casted Kirsten Dunst who plays everything perfectly) and hopes to win her over. Of course Peter keeps his spider-y ways to himself and doesn't tell a soul. But soon trouble arises with the Green Goblin (Willam Dafoe) when he makes his appearance and soon causes turmoil in New York City. The whole thing is beyond great. Visual effects are awesome without being distracting, the plot is so entertaining, and the acting is superb. This is a great movie that you should definitely see!! 9 stars
10.0~Can't wait to see the next two adventures! Joene Sign in Permalink Since two days now I am the proud owner of the Spidey-DVD! I watched it a couple of times now and I just can't get enough of it; I still wonder how Sam Raimi pulled this thing of... First of all I would like to say that the casting for this movie is superb! Tobey is just perfect for the rol of Peter Parker because he is not that Leonardo kind-of-guy! He has proved to be a very good actor to my opinion, for example the rol he played in "The Cider House Rules" was excellent. And then there's the owh so beautiful Kirsten... yesterday I saw "The Virgin Suicides" (go rent it immediately if you havn't seen it yet!) and now I know even more why she was chosen to play the rol of the gorgeous Mary Jane. To choose the actor of the Green Goblin must have been an easy one, you can tell just by looking at the face of Willem Dafoe that... secretly he is the Green Goblin! I mean, look at his face expressions! The length of the movie, about two hours, is enough to tell the story without leaving important details referring to the comic book. In my opinion director Sam (Xena) Raimi, did a fantastic job and he can put his "Spiderman" right next to Tim Burton's "Batman". Both movies have that special superhero thing... Because this movie is so amazing, I can't wait to see the next two movies. I heard that for the second movie they want Dr. Otto Octavius & The Green Lizard to play the bad guys and for the third movie rumours are that Carnage & Venom will show their fighting skills to Spidey! Man, I wish it was may 2004.... Greetz and enjoy this movie!
10.0~WOW! vpihokiebird Sign in Permalink I've already seen the movie twice (once today and once yesterday), and I have to say it was SPECTACULAR! A must see... Tobey Maguire could not have played a better part, he really couldn't.... Very well done, and a fabulous movie....
10.0~Incredible. TheDemko Sign in Permalink This is going to sound like a typical fanboy review, but I just saw a sneak peak of Spiderman, and I found it to be simply Amazing. Each member of the cast was perfect for their role, specifically Willem Dafoe, who played the insanity role of the Green Goblin quite well. Tobey Maguire was an unexpected surprise, able to show both sides of the Spidey costume with ease. J.K. Simmons filled the always-fun role of J. Jonah with his own unique style - not at all like the Mr. Jameson we've seen in every other Spidey series before, but still enjoyable. Others have said that the screenplay was trite and overplayed. I disagree. I thought the story was very typical for a Spiderman-themed anything, but it served it's purpose as the basis of a (hopefully) long-term movie series. The next installation in this series will be more unique and originally, one would have to assume. I thought Stan Lee's minor cameo was unexpected, and in fact, it sounded like I was the only one in the theater to spot him. I won't spoil it, so that you can find The Man for yourself. Overall, I enjoyed the movie for what it was, an action-packed, somewhat dramatic, well-made summer blockbuster. I highly recommend this movie to those of all shapes, sizes, and ages! 8/10
9.0~Impressive tazora Sign in Permalink I was actually rather impressed with this movie. Despite my misgivings of Kirsten Dunst playing MJ, I was pleasantly surprised. Not only did they do a pretty good job casting the various characters, there was also some awesome eye candy included that I was definitely happy to see. The CG was seemless in most scenes and very nonintrusive in others. Tobey Maguire, though not as sarcastic as the comic book Spider-Man, was, nonetheless, a good choice for the part. His expressions lent so much to the character that I could actually believe that it was Peter Parker. Overall, I'd call this movie fun for the whole family.
6.0~An Enjoyable Sclockfest youdontsmellbad Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is a movie that watches like the start of a franchise rather than a film of its own. We sit, watch, laugh a little, and leave happy, if a little less than satisfied. I'll skip the plot synopsis, you already know. Tobey McGuire makes great use of his famous face in creating the Peter Parker character. We love the fact that he is a dork in any role, and this is no exception. He is believable as a nerd, and his unmasked scenes are effective, and genuinely enjoyable. When he gets swept in to action is when we lose interest a little. Kirsten Dunst gets the job done as Mary Jane, or M.J., her terrible androginous nickname in the movie. She can act, but doesn't need to try very hard to fill the role. Willem Dafoe is surprisingly endearing when he needs to be, as the Green Goblin. He could have used a better mask though. Perhaps one that won't so obviously turn into a Halloween mask this fall. The scenes with interaction between the main characters are nice, sweet, sometimes a little touching... blah blah blah. When it comes to the action scenes, once the novelty wears off you almost forget you're watching anything. The fact that that you know you're mostly looking at a CGI Spider-Man shooting through New-New York (Post 9-11) doesn't help the movie keep your attention. But oh well that doesn't really repel audiences does it? In the end you find that more than just the Twin Towers got changed. The people of New York emerge as the real heroes, awwww. And I didn't think it was possible to end it with an American flag, but director, Raimi, manages.
8.0~Swinging Fun freenachos Sign in Permalink I've never left a movie saying "I sure would like more explosions and punching!" but the action was very appealing in this movie and I actually thought there could be more. I remember Batman coming out in 1989 and the way it made a superhero fresh, new and exciting. I'm not a comic book fan but I was glad to see Spider-Man getting the same treatment. With what little I know, this movie did do the comic justice. Now that effects allow more superhuman powers for the actors, Spider-Man's jumping and swinging come off very well done. Think about it, Spider-Man isn't just flying straight ahead. You can't put some guy on a table in front of a blue screen to pull off the dramatic arcing motions of swinging from building to building 20 stories off the ground. The effects here were well done. It was especially impressive that the movie's action often took place in broad daylight with no dark shadows available to hide wires or distract the viewer from mediocre tricks. The story was clear from the start when Peter Parker said it's about a girl. This is a love story and it doesn't suck like the love story that bogged down Independence Day and other Hollywood "blockbusters". The plot is full of soap opera like twists and triangles (though "soap opera" is not a fair term). Tobey MacGuire is convincing as a superhero because he's convincing as the alter ego, Parker, from the start. Willem Dafoe is a great villain. His hard features and gravely voice are perfect for a comic book bad-guy. Hey, I liked the action scenes and the overall look of this film. It's a very pretty movie with a cool story!
9.0~Excellent comic book film Spanner-2 Sign in Permalink This film, based on the comic books, is absolutely one of the best film versions of a comic book superhero. Sam Raimi's style and his casting choices match the tone of the early Stan Lee/Steve Ditko comics perfectly. Tobey Maguire is an excellent choice to play gawky teenager Peter Parker and Kirsten Dunst as the "crush" next door is also a perfect casting choice. I'm a little less enthusiastic about Willem Dafoe's stint as the lunatic Green Goblin, but it works well enough to give Spidey a foe worth facing. The script follows the comic book origin story fairly closely, and certainly more closely than most other comics to film adaptions. While the effects work is somewhat shaky at times, it still works because we are, after all, looking at a big screen comic book. Definitely a fun film that is worth viewing. GRADE: A-
6.0~Thrilling ogrejedi Sign in Permalink Spiderman was fun to watch, like seeing those old comic books come to life. However, it suffered from a simple plot and generally poor dialogue. Overall, it's a movie that should not be missed, and it is a great movie--but not an excellent movie.
9.0~Great Comic to Screen Adaptation snoop23 Sign in Permalink Never before have I been excited to see a certain movie. I wasn't excited at all to see Star Wars Episode I then, nor am I excited to see the coming Episode II. Spider-Man though, had me hanging (pun intended) since they mentioned it was going to the big screen. I've been a Marvel Comics fanatic pretty much more than half my life, and I was afraid it wouldn't live up to expectations. But after seeing it on the opening night (I just had to), I just couldn't believe it. The opening credits, the introduction of the main players in the story, the retelling of Spidey's origin - is perfect. Let me put it this way: Kirsten Dunst IS Mary Jane Watson, Willem Dafoe IS Norman Osborn/Green Goblin and Tobey Maguire is definitely the perfect Peter Parker/Spider-Man just as Christopher Reeve is Superman or Michael Keaton is Batman. Maguire actually pulls off the character better than I'd expected, managing to exude the perfect geeky awkwardness in his encounters with MJ, as well as nerdish enthusiasm during the scenes in the laboratory and the exact over-exuberant reaction you'd expect from someone who's just discovered that he can do whatever a spider can. They all have played their respective roles to perfection, not to mention the supporting cast: Rosemary Harris as Parker's beloved Aunt May, J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and James Franco as Harry Osborn (who we might see in the sequel as the 'resurrected' Green Goblin). Perfect casting. A lot of credit goes to director Sam Raimi, for his depiction of Spider-Man has done this film justice. This movie owes a lot to the success of another Marvel comic to big screen adaptation of 'X-Men', which is the standpoint for all future superhero films. Great film, from start to finish. Go see it.
7.0~Poignant, fun and a faithful adaptation to the original comic book Sean_Thorniley Sign in Permalink Poignant, fun and a faithful adaptation to the original comic book. I am very critical of comic book movies since I am a huge fan of the medium and was tremendously disappointed in the Superman and Batman movies (all of them, some greatly!). This film however has again demonstrated that an adaptation of a comic book story can be fun and faithful to the story, yet be a film for all ages and those who may not have ever even read a comic book. The Crow was the only other good comic book movie in my opinion, but it was not an all ages fun ride as this is! I had the privilege of seeing the film last night, 4-30-02, in SF with the press and 300+ other folks for its "Bay Area Premiere". The acting is the finest portion of the film with the leads giving us depth that I was unsure would be allowed by the style of story chosen. Maguire was outstanding at being a guy who can rarely catch a break, but attract difficulty with ease and aplomb. He is awkward with the woman he loves, but eloquent when dealing with the familiar, just as most teenagers are even today. He gave us wonderful joy at the prospect of "web swinging" and kicking some much deserved ass! Dafoe is wonderfully scary as the man who has succumbed to the power games of the corporate world that drives a decent man mad striving for perfection in himself while trying to hard to please all the wrong people to no avail and then being consumed by guilt that has built over the years of family neglect which finally helps to push him over the edge when an opportunity to make a huge mistake presents itself. The rest of cast is nearly as spectacular with the J.K. Simmons turning in the best performance in the film as J. Jonah Jamason. When he appeared on screen things lite up even more and he was on fire making everyone in the audience laugh and myself nearly p** my pants. Harris as Aunt May and Robertson as Uncle Ben were excellent choices and gave the film a great deal of its credibility and finesse. Letting what happens to Ben and Peter (I am not telling) was wonderful and the best punctuation to what makes Peter do what he does and brings complete credibility to the story. I am not a huge Dunst fan, but she was just fine as the love of Peter Parker's life and a person much like Peter only neither was conscious of the fact. This to me is a more real version of "true love". The script was far stronger than I expected with some wonderful dialog; verbal exchanges, solid plot points and pacing. Many a good parenting lesson can be found in this film as well as interesting thoughts about the choices that we make in life that we might think are no big deal when in the heat of passion, but may well come back to haunt us if we don't think before we act/speak: which is the trust of the film in my humble opinion. The direction from Raimi was also much better than I anticipated coming from someone who is known (and loved) for his over the top camp and action. Many of the fight and action sequences where more "over done" than I like, but they were solid and much like a comic of the Silver Age from whence the story comes so it fit the film fine. Nice cinematography without the CGI taking over and detracting from the realism, in fact it made much of the web swinging truly believable. A few points made things a bit hard to "believe", but over all I think most folks will be able to suspend their disbelief. Danny Elfman. Need I say more? He is the man when it comes to "super hero" music and is the closest thing to John Willams and the late great Bernard Herman there is today. He subtly sets the mood and most of the audience probably doesn't even realize it. Tomorrow is my day off and I will be purchasing the score to add to my collection!
1.0~truly terrible llewdebkram Sign in Permalink I have just seen Spiderman and I am truly dissapointed after all I have heard about it! Such a weak plot, if indeed any! Far too many coincidences in the movie and by far the worst.... that terrible plastic looking green goblin thingy!...a baddy straight from the banal bowels of power rangers baddy land. Never have I seen a movie that I feel deserved a 1 (aweful) out of 10
10.0~Flawless gpolice_97 Sign in Permalink this film succeeds in EVERY way! the actors fit their parts to a T, the acting was Great! , great story, great effects!!! one to see a bunch of times!... see this in the theatre, dont wait for home video.. kirsten looked GREAT in this, and toby did GREAT as spidey
7.0~Far better than expected. Stefan-Kuppen-1 Sign in Permalink Spider-man, a movie I had to see. I was a bit sceptical however about the quality of the special effects. They did not look good in the few previews I'd seen. Having seen the film I can only say that it was funny, witty and entertaining. It was better than expected, and a lot better than other films in the genre, like batman and X-men. If you expect the plot to follow the comic books page by page you will probably feel a bit cheated. They used quite a few short cuts to make it easier for the "know nothing about spider-man" viewer.
10.0~Best comic movie ever arkiver-1 Sign in Permalink This movie ROCKED. I loved it, it was better than Cats, I want to see it again and again and again... Seriously though, Tobey McGuire is Peter Parker/Spider-man. His performance was fantastic. And Willem Dafoe, rocked as the Green Goblin. The story was excellent. Sam Raimi was the perfect director for this film. Can't wait to see what happens in the sequel. Some of the effects were a little cheesy (CGI-looking), but that doesn't hamper the story. I give this flick a 10 all the way. This sets the bar for all movies to come based on comics; this is the way it should be done.
10.0~Spawned a Genre. Screw This New SpiderCat. powermandan Sign in Permalink Before Spiderman, there wasn't very many superhero movies. Most of them sucked. After Spiderman's release in 2002 and its sequels in 2004 and 2007, we saw the Dark Knight movies, Thor, Captain American, Iron Man, etc. Without this movie, many people in these superhero films would not have careers. Unlike the cartoons and comics, this is slightly different version of Spiderman with a different story. Why did they change? Dramatic purposes were needed. See the 2012 reboot to see why. A nerdy Peter Parker gets bitten by a spider at a high school science field trip and develops radical powers. Although still timid and soft-spoken, he gains confidence and tries to win over Mary Jane Watson: his life-long crush. Meanwhile, Norman Osborne's most recent Oscorp experiment goes drastically wrong and develops a vicious alter-ego--the Green Goblin--who Peter must stop. Anybody that says the 2012 reboot beats this either thinks Andrew Garfield is hot and/or are hardcore comic fans that don't understand how movies work. Tobey's Peter Parker is kind, caring likable, hardworking and mysterious that can't seem to catch a break. Mary Jane is sweet, has high hopes, is popular, and comes from a bad home. Norman Osborne is emotionally- destructive and tortured by his other personality, Green Goblin. This Green Goblin is freaking scary, yet funny villain that hasn't yet been topped. (Well, Heath Ledger did.) The Love story is original and better than the new one. In this, Peter keeps himself a mystery from Mary Jane, yet is still her emotional comfort who is always there. The new one is just him getting the girl right away and developing "chemistry." The hero doesn't get the girl in this? That is originality. This movie is also very unforgettable. Tobey is so much better than Garf-cat. For one, he doesn't have a stupid haircut. For another, he is smart, but the whole movie isn't just Peter doing science experiments and trying to find out about his parents. Peter is also more muscular and looks like a superhero type, while Garfield is just skin and bones. Peter is developed so well in this, we feel his exact moods. Garfield's weren't bad, but not good. Tobey wasn't disrespectful to anybody like Garfield was throughout the whole movie. Tobey was more deserving of his powers. Tobey's Spider powers being internal makes him more of a superhuman. Garfield's discovery of his powers were so stupid. Garfield wined a lot more than Tobey did. This Peter was constantly changing throughout the whole movie, Garfield stayed the same. Tobey pulled off the geek persona while Garfield failed at a geek trying to be cool. Tobey's Spiderman delivers funny one-liners while fighting villains while Garfield breaks out into extremely stupid 10 minute songs and dances. Garfield gives up hunting his uncle's killer. Garfield only saved, what, 2 people? And caused that death of Gwen's father. Tobey saved many people throughout the whole movie and causes no deaths. Sorry for so many comparisons. It's a dirty job, but somebody had to do it!
6.0~Saw the movie... liked the comics ! jesper_sommer Sign in Permalink My expectations were high, as I have been a Marvel Comics fan for many years. Unfortunately, great effects and a rather good bunch of actors were unable to rescue this film from its own poor plot. If I wanted to be in a terrible mood afterwards... if I wanted a heartbreaking story... if I wanted a drama to make me cry... WOULD I WATCH A "SPIDER MAN" MOVIE ???? What were the scriptwriters THINKING when they wrote this script ? One thin is for sure: They were not thinking "marvel" and "super hero". The tale of Spider man is a tale of desperation, hopelessness, broken hearts and despair in quantities that would make even "Titanic" look like a cheerfull comedy. I am aware of the fact, that the Marvel-based Spider man has problems in his life, but does that mean that 85% of a whole movie should be about the misery of the main character ? I hope the 2nd Spider man movie is not as bad... or rather: "sad"... as this one !
9.0~Shy but great! jjackson1-284-155747 Sign in Permalink Considered as one of the most successful superhero movies ever made, "Spider-Man" is a superhero film adaptation of one of Stan Lee's most popular Marvel comics, and becoming one of the first movies to score the highest opening weekend in the box office. There's no wonder, because this is an exciting and enjoyable motion picture. One of my childhood favorites, to be exact! This movie tells the origin story of Peter Parker, or Spider-Man, portrayed by Tobey Maguire, whom after being bit by a radioactive spider, he has gained extraordinary powers to climb walls, shoot web, and beat bad guys. But all that must be put to the test when Parker has to defeat one of the first villains of the Spider-Man universe, the Green Goblin, portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Although Maguire is somewhat bland in a few of his movies, I respected that he fit the role of Peter Parker perfectly, playing a shy kid, with no powers to either beat the bad guy or win the girl. Although given some of the corniest lines of dialouge in this movie, Kirsten Dunst makes an adorable portrayal as Mary Jane Watson, while giving a great chemistry with her co-star. But, Willem Dafoe seems a little miscast playing the deadly Green Goblin, feeling more like he's suitable for drama, instead of action. Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and J.K. Simmons, round up the supporting cast, bringing some memorable performances on-screen, especially Simmons, who steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, the angry editor chief of the Daily Bugle. There are few corny and goofy moments from here and there, but that doesn't stop the exciting momentum that this movie brings. Filled with impressive visual effects and a wonderful music score by Danny Elfman, director Sam Raimi perfectly stays true to the original Spider-Man concept, and delivers plenty of exciting action sequences that are both fun to watch, and stay true to the plot. Behind "The Dark Knight" and "The Avengers", "Spider-Man" is probably my third favorite superhero movie. I can watch this movie over and over again, and it's still a fun time. I was easily impressed with this movie, and it never disappoints to entertain. Everyone will find something to enjoy for sure. "Spider-Man", in my review, "a refreshing story, and exciting action".
1.0~Pure crap... drosales Sign in Permalink This was so bad I left halfway during the movie when the jokes went from bad to ^%^#$#$. Spider-man was even worse than 'Batman and Robin' in some ways! Everything in this flick was wrong: concept, story, script, dialogue, characters, acting, cast (miscasted some actors, wasted others), effects, unfunny jokes, anachronisms... Stay away from this piece of crap. Or, better, when it is released on DVD and VHS buy all the copies you can find and burn them. All thinking persons in the world will be grateful for this heroic deed. If you want to see a truly great movie about a superhero, check out Tim Burton's 'Batman' and Richard Donner's 'Superman', and enjoy a couple of real masterpieces. Spider-Man was supposed to have been produced on a budget of $140 million dollars, and it sure looks the part. $1 mil. on filming, $139 mil. on brainstorming at the local pub. If I were even somewhat involved in the making of this folly, I would be really ashamed of myself. :-(
8.0~how can a movie be so good but still lack from time to time? fearfact0 Sign in Permalink Spider-man is the kind of movie people wait a while for. Not because it's a 40 year old comic icon, or because it's the tentpole picture of the summer season, or because it's guaranteed to be huge, or even because Kirsten dunst is in a wet sleeveless shirt (my favorite). Spider-man is the kind of movie people wait for because it is guaranteed fun. From the origins of Spider-man, to the Macho Man cameo (Bonesaw? rock on), to some of the choreography, Spidey swings. Now onto complaints. Special effects lacked in numerous areas. for instance (minor spoilers alert) there is a scene reminiscent of The Matrix where Spier-man is dodging pumpkin bombs. While impressive, I couldn't help but notice the lack of joints on Spider-man. The most obvious special effect in the movie. In fact, you can tell without even paying attention when Tobey ends and CGI begins...for shame. Same goes for The Green Goblin. Dafoe and CGI create a viable villain, but they're like fraternal twins instead of one person. Sam Raimi is a brilliant director, but if he can't keep track of Spider-man in the webslinging scenes, how is the audience expected to? Raimi tries his best to keep up with the CGI effect, but eventually he just resorts to filming Spidey in a circle, obscuring the background in favor of trying to keep the hero on screen. This is a suffering point. Near the end, he seems to have the hang of it a little better, but for the first hour and 40 minutes, I was annoyed. New York is pretty clean in a lot of the scenes. why? Because they were obvious sets. The balcony was terrible looking. I kept waiting for Mary Jane's friend Juliet to appear, but nothing ever happened. Honestly, it's not that bad. But man, if you look, you'll see what I mean. I admit that I had a lot of fun with the movie, and I'll watch it again. but I can also admit that i'm not the biggest spider-man fan ever--I preferred X-Men. I gave the movie an 8. It was terrific and fun, but it wasn't flawless.
7.0~A good entertainment film, but not as great as his box office. y_xu Sign in Permalink A good entertainment film, but not as great as his box office. The special effect is so, so, the acting is good. The film's success is based on the success of the comic book and the people's needs to be entertained.
7.0~Amazingly cheesy, and I love it! ethspud Sign in Permalink I feel like even since Spider-Man 2 was released back in 2004, people have seemed to have forgotten this film, and disregarded it. This film is really good. People see this film nowadays and say that it's BAD, but then proceed to love Spider-Man 2. I would say this film is not one of the greatest Spider-Man films ever made, but it's also the best film in the Raimi Trilogy. I know everyone goes to Spider-Man 2, saying it's the superior film in the trilogy, but I disagree. This film not only shows us the struggles of Peter Parker, but also the responsibility of being Spider-Man. The second film tried to do this, but ended up focusing too much on Peter. Now, I'm not saying focusing on the alter-ego is bad, in fact it's very good for the story, but when you focus too much on Peter, it doesn't work as well. Maybe I'm somewhat biased as I watched this film a lot as a kid, and therefore, I prefer it to Spider-Man 2, but I still love this film. It's cheesy, funny, stereotypical, and I love it. If you haven't seen it yet, watch it!
10.0~Another Success for Marvel Comics! Brogan Sign in Permalink I've always enjoyed movies that are made based on comic books. In fact one of my earliest movie going memories was watching the original 1978 SUPERMAN with Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman. Then when BATMAN was released I then not only enjoyed movies more, but also comic books. Then Hollywood decided to "cash in" on the success of BATMAN, and release more films based on comic books (PUNISHER, CAPTIAN AMERICA, SPAWN, BLADE, etc.) But Warner Bros. was just as gulity by releasing more than enough sequals for BATMAN (they should have stopped after Tim Burton and Michael Keaton bowed out). But now the latest craze is Marvel comics. With the success and great quality of X-MEN two years ago, now comes the biggest and most anticipated Marvel super-hero: SPIDER-MAN! For those who never read the comic, or watch the 1970's cartoon (with the catchy song title) here is the basic story of the plot that is in the film. Before he was a super-hero, he was a super-nerd, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is the top student and achiever at his high school. For that he is teased and picked on by the other jealous and cruel students, but Peter has normal small dreams. The only thing that he really wants is to win the heart of the friendly girl that he has had the biggest crush with, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). I can relate with that. While on a field trip at the science center, Peter is bitten at his hand by one of the super-spiders that are scientific engineered. With this bite, Peter inherits all of the powers that the super-spider has: stong web, able to jump great distance, stonger muscles, etc. While Peter discovers his new powers, his only other friend (besides Mary Jane) Harry Osborn (James Franco) is realizing that his father, brilliant scientist and millionare Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) is acting strange, and there are bizarre murders surrounding Norman's science company. Norman self-tested a powerful chemical that backfired and drove Norman to become schizophrenic and also have super human strength. With Peter and Norman's super strength, Peter becomes the friendly and brave Spider-Man, with Norman's new evil mind he becomes the dark and vicious Green Goblin. Now with these two powers in New York City, who will win? That is the premise of the plot, it's not complex, but then again which comic book into film is? Comic books are mostly based on characters and their personalities. But to have a successful comic film, you need to have your characters (especially your super-heroes) well developed, not paper thin. SUPERMAN, BATMAN, and X-MEN all did this, and I'm pleased to say that SPIDER-MAN is the same. Screenwriter David Koepp does a great job developing the characters for the screen. You understand who Peter, Mary Jane, and Norman are, and you seen that there is more of a human personality with their characters. While director Sam Raimi does a great job with the pacing of the story, keeping it entertaining and exciting. But most of all, giving it the same type of flow that you would read in a comic-book. And the music score by the much beloved Danny Elfman also gives it a comic-book feel. Note: if you're going to make a comic-book into film, you must have Danny Elfman do the music score. But what I feel the strongest element with SPIDER-MAN is the romantic chemistry between Peter and Mary Jane. I haven't seen such a romantic relationship in a comic into film since Superman and Lois Lane. Instead of just casting someone to play the damsel in distress, Kristin Dunst does a great job as Mary Jane. While Tobey Maguire also gets kudos as the love-struck Peter who is always smitten with her, but won't reveal his secret-identity as Spider-Man (with whom Mary Jane falls in love with). And Willem Dafoe is also good as the villian Green Goblin. I think creator Stan Lee should be proud of what Sam Raimi and company did with his most popular comic character. What I also enjoyed about SPIDER-MAN is that it has a tounge-in-cheek humor similar to the original SUPERMAN. Who didn't laugh when Clark Kent went to the phone booth to change into Superman, to see that it's not a full booth? The scene where Peter first reveals his super-human strength during a wrestling match has the same kind of humor. Overall, SPIDER-MAN isn't Oscar material, but it is fun, and that's it purpose. Had SPIDER-MAN been released last summer, it would have easily been the best film of the summer, along with A.I. Let's just hope that the rest of this summer's film will be just as good. But I doubt it will. Very entertaining and enjoyable! ***** (out of five)
9.0~Good stuff neil-476 Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is a very good film. It is also a very good super-hero origin film. It also has the distinction of being quite a good super-hero film (origin films are often so tied up with telling the origin story that they forget to give the audience a fair helping of what they went to the movie for - the super-hero of the hour actually doing his super-heroic thing). A well-cast Tobey Maguire goes through sufficient dollops of (rather mature) teenage angst before suffering the bite of a radioactive spider, contributing to his much-loved uncle's murder through inaction, designing and making an extremely snazzy costume, falling foul of his best friend's loopy millionaire Dad, and finally making headway with the girl of his dreams (headway, in this case, being an extremely wet upside down kiss). And the audience is favoured with some decent Spidery goings-on, with a particularly effective climax on some bridge in new York (probably the Brooklyn Bridge, but don't quote me - I'm from the Isle of Wight). The performances are all good: as noted, Maguire is a little old for high school age peter parker. And the other slightly wrong note is the absence of wisecracking from Spidey in costume. Otherwise all is very well (with Rosemary Harris and JK Simmons spot on, visually and performance-wise, as Aunt May and J Jonah Jameson). The CGI is a little wobbly early on, but is mostly very near to what the comic suggests Spider-Man's movements must be. And the emotional journeys of the characters all work well in this satisfying movie.
8.0~With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility ThomasDrufke Sign in Permalink As dated as some of the dialogue, acting, effects shots, and plot points are, there will always be a special place in my heart for the original Spider-Man film (I'm not going to count those 70's features). This is largely due to the fact that it was the first superhero film I ever saw in a theater. I specifically remember where I saw it, who I was with, where I sat, and how terrified I was at the 3D images of the Green Goblin's face. For those reasons, I'm always keen on re- watching this one. Before the golden age of superhero film, Spider-Man came out at a time when being inspired by Donner's 1978 Superman and Burton's 1989 Batman was the norm. You can clearly see how influenced Sam Raimi was to those films, specifically with his choice of bringing in Danny Elfman to do the music. This all gives the film a very nostalgic vibe to me. However, some dated qualities manage to shine through some of the better moments. Those being the fact that Kirsten Dunst's 'Mary Jane' is essentially a useless plot device for the entire film. This doesn't necessarily change throughout the trilogy, but it's overtly clear with the first Spider-Man. My 8-year-old mind can push aside the damsel in distress moments, but 15 years later it becomes increasingly more difficult. The same goes for the dull dialogue between MJ and Peter, and the unquestionably awkward line delivery at times. I'm all for Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, but their relationship isn't always sold well enough in the various scenes they have together. With that said, someone who undoubtedly does sell their scenes is Willem Dafoe. He was terrifying as Norman Osborn a child, and he still sends a few chills down my spine when I see him talking to himself through a mirror in the Osborn mansion. But he isn't just a one-note villain either. Significant time is spent developing him as a forceful antagonist, but also a troubled man with misplaced intentions. In today's age of setting up future films way too far in advance, there usually isn't enough time given to developing villains (i.e. every MCU film), but luckily that's not the case with Green Goblin. Overall, Spider-Man is clearly a dated film in many areas upon re- watch, but it's hard not to overlook them based on pure nostalgic alone. In a way, some of the dated qualities actually end up making it even more charming. +Nostalgia +Score +Dafoe -Dated, and definitely cheesy 8.0/10
8.0~A Film that Just Makes You Wanna Jump Out of Your Seat and Start Pretending to be Spider-Man Victorious_One Sign in Permalink "Spider-Man" is truly one heck of a movie full of thrills, action, and excitement. The fight scenes in this film were awesome, especially the ones between Spider-Man and Goblin, which were very well done. Moreover, this film has become a dream-come-true to all Spiderman fans who have watched all the Spider-Man cartoon animation and played all the Spider-Man games. I also have to say that the producers made an excellent choice of making Tobey Maguire play Spider-Man, who really did a good job in his performance. "Spider-Man" didn't only entertain me when I first watched it, but it made me learn a very important life-lesson, which is "With great power comes great responsibility." This is something that could be applied to daily life in all aspects. There is no doubt that "Spider-Man" is one successful film, for they produced "Spider-Man 2" and "Spider-Man 3" is currently in production. All in all, "Spider-Man" is a terrific, entertaining film and is truly worth watching.
9.0~The Makings of a Classic and the End All Be All of Film Renditions of Everybody's Favorite Web Slinger The_Truth_You_Cant_Handle Sign in Permalink 2002's Spider-Man is a film that will always have a special place in my memory as, though I did see the first X-Men film on television some time after it came out on DVD, I never saw it in theaters, Spider-Man, on the other hand, was the first superhero film I saw on the silver screen. It was a film that had enough impact on my very young mind to make Spider-Man my second favorite superhero, right behind the Caped Crusader himself. I loved this film as a kid, almost as much as Jack Nicholson's outing as the Joker in the original 1989 Batman film, and watching Spider-Man again and again as I grew older has only made me appreciate it's spectacle even more. For one thing, the special effects were top notch for the early 2000s and, for the most part, hold up very well today. That is, aside from the very early 2000s video game-esque crawling spider and spinning DNA strand intro animations, which I can't give them too much trash for because they are certainly not an integral part of the film, and I think they were going for a stylized, comic book appearance anyways. Aside from that though the special effects are still fantastic looking today with epic swooping camera angles and fantastically choreographed fight scenes. The overall cinematography of the film is grade-A with a perfect combination of practical and special effects for the majority of the film, aside from the occasional, dated, 90s- esque close-up shots of Spidey yelling to show how much fun he's having, but this is a movie about the web-slinger, and the web-slinging looks great. The score of the film is fantastic as well with a powerful, trumpeting orchestra, presenting the perfect tone for both the action and emotionally-oriented parts of the film. It is yet another winner for Danny Elfman in my book and is the type of score that I would take any day over many of the heavily electronic scores of recent years even while these symphonic pieces seem to be fading away in favor of soundtracks that can be made by two guys with a computer and a $100 software program. As for the acting, the majority of the cast is very strong and supported by an excellent script comprised of a multitude of Stan Lee's memorable as ever characters, making for some very compelling performances. Starting with the amazing wall-crawler himself, Spider-Man, a.k.a. Peter Parker, played by Tobey Maguire, while there are certainly those who would object, mainly due to the train-wreck of a final installment which was Spider-Man 3, which was mainly a directorial disaster, in my opinion, I felt Tobey did a fantastic job as Spidey. Before what I imagine was director Sam Raimi's evil alter ego forcing Maguire to die his hair and dance around like a total numbskull, Tobey Maguire was delivering Spidey performances like this, bringing in all of the awkward nerdiness, emotion, charisma, humor, compassion, and complexity of both Spider-Man and Peter Parker, Maguire is not at all a bad pick for a leading role and he carries the film marvelously. Next we have the great Willem Dafoe whose role as the Green Goblin/Norman Osborne is easily in my top 10, if not top 5 supervillain performances of all time. Dafoe brings all of his Academy Award nominated, and in my opinion deserving, acting chops to the role bringing the menacing insanity of the character along with his emotional conflict as a father, friend, and businessman. When you're watching an actor like Willem Dafoe, you know your in for a classic performance, I only wish he had a more revealing mask, because with the diversity of this man's facial expressions, he could have brought a whole new level of terror to the Green Goblin if he did. To follow Willem would be Kristen Dunst as Marry Jane Watson, Parker/Spidey's love interest and, while I can't say I'm consistently her biggest fan, she delivers on the emotional aspects and a likable performance, so you can't ask for much more than that. After Ms. Dunst would be who I see as the only short link in the film if only because he isn't used enough, or allowed to develop his character enough in the film, Mr. James Franco, I never thought I'd say it because I am planted firmly in Franco's corner as of recent years but his character simply does not get enough screen time for you to care a whole lot about the misfortunate Harry Osborne. The last actor of note other than those characters would be J. K. Simmons as a simply spot on, bar none, perfect J. Jonah Jameson, after his performance there is just no one else I can think of for the role. Overall, Spider-Man was a groundbreaking superhero film both visually and emotionally. It is spear-headed by an all-star cast and supported by a phenomenal original score. Though the film may have a few short comings, and can even feel a bit dated at times it is still, what I believe will be, and already is for me a superhero classic. The third film may have fallen off in it's own respect but this first film was a monumental step in the right direction for superhero films and for that, it's a 5 out of 5. For Spidey's Burning Building Baby Help Line, this is The Truth You Can't Handle, signing off.
8.0~With Great Power comes Great responsibility hdiaz26 Sign in Permalink I saw the movie last week, and it was good, funny, entertaining, but of course it had a lot of plot holes and it was predictable. However it has all the elements that a movie needs to be a success. The script is sometimes bad, the writer David Koepp wrote it 9 times, because San Raimi wasn't sure of it. This isn't a masterpiece, but overall is just good, the acting was so so, Kirsten Dunst has do a lot of better work than this. Tobey Maguire is good as Spider-Man, i truly believe his nerd character, i suspect he was like this when he was younger i don't know i feel it. The first part for me is the best, that is the part that gives my 8 rating, the second part wasn't very entertaining and was very predictable. Rating: 7 of 10
10.0~best movie i have seen in a long time stoneacheck Sign in Permalink First off, i was never a huge fan, but i always loved spidey. I watched the saturday morning cartoon show, and played the video games, but never really read the comics. I went into this movie thinking that it would be all action, and just fighting the green goblin. I got my fight scenes, along w/ a really good story. It gave those a chance who hadnt been big fans, to see how he came to be, and why spiderman isnt like other superheroes. He didnt ask for his powers, and he sees it as his gift, and curse. He still is human, and if you cut him, he will bleed. Tobey did a great job portraying the shy and nerdy aspect of peter parker, while having charisma and courage when spidey. I thought that the story would suffer, and it would be like tomb raider movie, and be like watching a video game, but it flowed really well, and was realistic. The love triangle of peter, mj, and harry also creates a lot of tension in the plot, and really helps connect this movie, and leaves room for a sequel. Overall, i would say this is the best movie i have seen in a few years. And one last thing, you get so engulfed in the movie, the 2 hours fly by. P.S. - Sit in one of the first 5 rows, its more fun... lots more fun.
8.0~A Classic Comes to Life! I_luv_BradPitt Sign in Permalink I enjoyed this movie alot. The cast was a good one and the movie followed along with the comic books we've all been reading for years. If you're a "Spidey" fan, this is a must see. The only questionable thing in this movie is Toby Maguire as the lead. Overall though it was/is a good movie and one worth adding to any home library.
9.0~A great movie with minor flaws Skeletors_Hood Sign in Permalink I went to this movie with the same frame of awe and excitement that I had as a young lad, reading Spider-Man comics. My father and I would always enjoy a great comic together, especially Spider-Man. How he would have loved this movie. Okay kids, it has some flaws to it, and I won't deny that. There are times when the script lags, and scenes drag on (especially the ones with Mary Jane). I would have liked to see a more traditional Green Goblin outfit, but I forgive that, because it still worked, and Defoe was so great as the villain that I concentrated more on his performance than his clothes. Some of the cgi is a little too fast paced, and it seems to be choppy, but I wonder if that was on purpose? Something to think about perhaps. My BIG complaint centers around Mary Jane. I am not a Dunst fan in any way, shape or form, and I still think that she should have been left out of the project. It was just so hard to believe her as MJ. However, if she had played Gwen Stacey, then she would have been perfect, especially with the last scene on top of the bridge. She had no real chemistry with Peter, and it was hard to believe that they were becoming closer. And it was these scenes that dragged on. Now, as to why everything else works. Folks, it's a movie based from a comic book, and whenever Hollywood makes a movie like that, it will be a hit or a bomb for one basic reason, and that is how faithful it is to its source. Basically, for my money, this movie included all the major points of the Spider-Man mythos; the spider-bite, the family situation, the death of a father figure, the outfit (not leather, you'll notice), the love interest, the change in character with Peter wanting fame to becoming a hero, etc. If you look at other comic book movies, they succeed if they do just that. Batman and Superman both kept the basic elements of the story, as did X-Men, the Mask and the Crow. These movies are considered great comic book films because if it, and yes, a good script helps as well. Overall, there are flaws, as in every movie. However, Spider-Man sets a standard to be lived up to, as did Superman in the 70's. Superman is still my fave comic book movie, and is still a better movie that Spider-Man, but as far as comic book movies go, it's on my top 3 (just under Batman).
8.0~A cartoon springs to life norbc Sign in Permalink Simply probably the best comic book hero movie made, translating to the screen much better than the earlier Superman or Batman epics. The acting is top-notch, the story line is fun and well-paced, and the computer graphics are excellent. What probably makes this so much better than the others, however, is the human qualities and frailties and doubts built into old Spidey -- his trademark. It brings him to life and makes him seem much less comic-bookish than other such heroes. It is indeed a three-dimensional character, rather than one- or two-dimensional. This one is just plain fun, guilty pleasure, with the bonus of being superbly written, acted and directed as well. May the sequels, when they arrive, live up to the standard set here!
9.0~I liked it a lot. geddyneilalex28 Sign in Permalink I admit hat I have not read the comics, so I cannot speak to how accurate the movie is. If it is not, well, OK, I am over it. I enjoyed the special effects, but I enjoyed the story a lot more. Tobey plays Peter/Spider-Man as a decent kid trying to do the right thing. I liked that. I have no complaints about the movie, and I do not want to drone on and on about all the things I thought were cool. I heard some comic book geeks moaning about this, that, and the other thing not being like the comic. To them I say, you would gripe about something no matter what they did. Sit back and enjoy the ride.
7.0~True to the Spirit of the Comics Space_Mafune Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi with this film vibrantly brings to life the world of Spider-Man and his many supporting characters. This film's plot--a mix of elements from the comic stories involving Spidey's origin and The Green Goblin kidnaps Gwen Stacey (although here Gwen is replaced by Mary-Jane Watson) epic was I feel just right for the first Spider-Man film. There's loads of action and one can easily get lost in the fun of epic of Spider-Man as easily as if one was reading one of his classic comic book adventures. However everything in this film is not roses...for one thing, they weren't being anywhere near careful enough about Spider-Man's secret identity as it should be obvious to a good many in this film who Spidey really is (and not just the Green Goblin either) and another the CGI is haphazard...sometimes it looks great, other times it just looks too cartoony and fake. Still all an all a winning effort from Raimi.
7.0~Hilarious! Adventurous! To sum it up. MOVIES4SARAH Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is so funny in some scenes, adventurous the whole way through....Tobey Maguire definitely captured the role of Peter Parker, a troubled high school student turned a super hero. Kirsten Dunst is stylish playing the beautiful Mary Jane Watson.. Willem Dafoe? Great! Willem Dafoe playing the Green Goblin was an awesome choice... I don't think many actors or actresses could capture the roles of Mary Jane, Spider Man, and the Green Goblin better than Kirsten Dunst, Tobey Maguire, and Willem Dafoe. Overall this movie deserves a B+.
8.0~spider-man review. sherrimichel2004 Sign in Permalink This is just a good Spider-Man film. There is nothing amazing about. It is an origin story so it does move a little slow. But Spidey's origin has always been a multi step process.Although details are changed a lot, Peter's first love is Mj, the name of the wrestler is changed, the webs are organic etc., the script mostly understood the characters. There is a lot of development to them. They are all well-defined. Although this is probably the least dramatic of the spider films, it doesn't have any fun with itself. When Peter enters the suit, he is supposed to be a wise-cracking, fun loving guy. He doesn't change at all. He just mumbles and mopes around. Tobey Maigure gives a wooden performance as Peter Parker/ Spider-man. That is my only real complaint.
10.0~GREAT MOVIE!!!! Jennie Parker Sign in Permalink I saw this movie twice in theaters and I plan to go again. Wonderful plot, wonderful action, wonderful acting, wonderful EVERYTHING! Willem Dafoe was great as the green goblin/Norman Osborn, and pretty scary, too. Tobey Maguire was perfect as Peter Parker/Spiderman, (It didn't hurt that he is totally hot, too!) and James Franco was great as Harry Osburn. Dont see this movie with a young kid. I found it a bit intense for little kids. See it. YOu'll enjoy it.
3.0~This movie sucks!!! nmingaars Sign in Permalink What a disaster, this movie! Is it just not possible to give priority to a good story and not an overkill of special effects? Two hours of wrong acting, a very thin story-line, bad comic-research (oh god, the webshooter...) and a real drag of a romance, we were already looking on our watch halfway the movie. Indeed the movie is better then the eighties-version, but no wonder with computer effects nowadays. Still we missed the charm that makes Spiderman nearly the best superhero on my list. Together with Thing from the Fantastic Four, Spiderman makes the funniest and sarcastically remarks in comics. In the movie they totally overlooked this strength during the fights, pity. To give just one positive remark; the webslinging in NY were great. To bad you see it not more frequently in the movie. We were very interested what kind of replacement was put into the movie after the Twin Tower incident but we could only detect the Stars and stripes-flag on the Empire State at the end of the movie, that's it? The movie was now again haunted with bad luck because the US Army didn't want to do bussiness with the Oscorp-company of the Green Goblin but instead did business with...Qwest! Bad choice after that fraud. Hopefully the directors of future superhero-movies have more heart for the comic itself. The Batman-movies didn't reflect the real Dark Knight character also. Only Spawn was a bit more believable.
6.0~No buildup of intensity flyersjoe Sign in Permalink Overall, I was disappointed. Special effects were nice, the acting at times was distractingly poor, but to be fair, there were some good scenes as well. By the 90 minute mark I actually started to get bored. Raimi had a good cast and a good script but I felt he didn't give enough buildup....and the climax was unrewarding for me....the film was just flat and the score didn't help it any. I like Raimi a lot, but I think Raimi failed to give his actors, script, and Spiderman the direction they needed.
8.0~A really great comic book adaptation MaxBorg89 Sign in Permalink "With great power comes great responsibility".These words, spoken by Peter Parker's uncle Ben(Cliff Robertson)during their last conversation and which have become Spider-Man's motto, also perfectly represent the challenge Sam Raimi was facing when asked to bring one of America's most loved superheroes to the screen. You can relax, fellas: Raimi's movie is definitely worth a look.Loosely based on the origin story and the Stan Lee/John Romita Sr. run, it's a fascinating mix of spectacular action and powerful drama, as it chronicles Peter Parker's(Tobey Maguire) transformation into a superhuman and the responsibilities deriving from said metamorphosis: while fighting crime to avenge his uncle's death, he also has to deal with his feelings for Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst) and his friendship with Harry Osborn(James Franco); add Harry's father Norman(Willem Dafoe), who's become schizophrenic psycho Green Goblin, and you've got a quite complicated situation. Raimi's excellent at showing us the hero's pain, as well as the one he causes to others, and he gets terrific performances from the entire cast, particularly Maguire, Dafoe and Robertson. On its own, it's a very good superhero flick, alongside the sequel, it's an absolute masterpiece. Recommended even if you don't care about the comics.
7.0~excellent osmanansari Sign in Permalink just watch the movie. its too good that i would like u people to watch it yourselves. it would be fun watching it a cinema but i watched it on my television set as English movies dont go on air in cinemas of Pakistan.
8.0~Easily great. SonicNights Sign in Permalink Spider-Man was the biggest Marvel film in 2002, because the film itself is great. Basically the plot is half origin story, half Green Goblin. Great plot, nice soundtrack, and amazing acting. 8/10
10.0~A terrific film with only a few MINOR problems. TomStrange Sign in Permalink A very engrossing and entertaining film with as much to offer long time spidey fans as it offers to action movie fans. What makes it great is the story of one Peter Parker who is well known to many comic book fans but may or may not be known to action movie fans. This was a task long in the making and very much worth the wait. I remember being very disappointed with the late seventies television attempt at presenting the story of Spiderman(even though I had only recently become acquainted with the character at the time). Please be advised that I intend to make direct references to the movie concerning plot and if you have not seen this movie do not read any further. I will start with what I consider to be a problem in the way Peter stands by while his Uncle's murderer falls to his death. In the comic book this guy lives and is left for the police to find but for the movie Peter gets to watch him die. He obviously has the power to prevent his death and yet does not. Where is the great power/ great responsibility in this? If he had captured him instead or saved his life I would not even mention this but this scene is tragicly flawed. My next problem with the story is the obvious way that Peter announces his transformation to his entire high school. He beats the crap out of the school bully in an "I have been genetically altered" manner. I guess people believe that public high school students are really stupid. There was a real opportunity to be clever here but alas chance missed. I think the entire idea of having spikes protrude from Peter's fingers(like fine hair)is incredibly moronic. This is supposed to explain how Spiderman wallcrawls? How are they on glass? metal forks? QUIT TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHAT DOES NOT NEED EXPLANATION! All of this talk about the Green Goblin's costume and nobody thinks to throw some purple paint on the suit? It's not that difficult to at least try to recognize a color scheme. I am sure the Hulk would have approved. Speaking of suits, was I the only one who was not certain if Osborn/Green Goblin was really killed as seen? I thought at first that he wasn't. I believe that this is a flaw in the scene and should not have been done in this manner. I did very much like the "Wizard of OZ" approach to the arrival of the Green Goblin. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst did a fantastic job with the characters. The enhanced Spider man costume with silver still looks silly. One of the best scenes in the movie is when Peter and MJ have a talk about the future in the backyard. There are very few times during the movie where anyone is comfortable using the nickname "MJ". My chief complaint about the late 70's Spiderman concerned the webshooters. No complaints now;)
4.0~Well this movie bites. udeaasykle Sign in Permalink I do admit that i didn't have high expectations when i saw this movie. I have seen a lot of superhero movies and they are never any good. I think Tobey is actually good for the role as Peter Parker. At least when i read that Leonardo DiCaprio at some point was suppose to play that part. The only thing that is good about these sort of movies is when the character get the super powers and you see the change for the first time. After that, it is really downhill. It is a shame to see a class actor like Willem Dafoe playing in this movie, at least when he is wearing a mask that seems to come from Toys 'R' Us. And the fact that Kirsten Dunst plays in this movie is for me enough reason to dislike it. And the ending with the bridge is just well... bad. Really bad. One good thing about this movie is the cameo of Bruce Campbell. Oh and the end credits so there is two things that are good about this movie. I rate this movie 4/10
8.0~Green goblin or Green Power Ranger? salchi182 Sign in Permalink Was it just me, or did the Green goblin look just like one of the bad guys from the Mighty Morphen Power Rangers Show? I just though his costume was that cheesy. Also, I thought that the love interest of a superhero was supposed to be good looking. I at no time (even during the rain scene) found her attractive. It was a turn off to see her round pudgy face and crooked teeth, and a bad picture in my mind of her saying "Bring it On." At least Batman had some hot Love Interests. Maybe in the next films the director will get the drift and cast somebody good looking rather than trying to impress a somewhat younger generation with a "popular" star. Kirsten stopped being cute when she was in Jumanji. If they wanted a young star, why not the girl from jurassic park for that matter. Who knows. I still liked the film regardless of the obvious computer animation and physically impossible stunts (even for a "super-engineered" spider) and the missed "little things" by the director (boom microphone bobbing up and down in the opening kitchen scene or lamp broken and instantly replaced in Peter Parkers room. Great Movie, yet not up to par with Star Wars, Matrix, Lord of the Rings, and other such epic films.
10.0~Lives up to the hype vlad_davidov Sign in Permalink Nothing was more satisfying than seeing this masterpiece before my friends did. The movie grabs a hold of you and doesn't let go until the ending credits. Danny Elfman once again pulls off a magnificent musical score. Although I personally think Tobey Maguire isn't exactly the best looking guy, but you can't really give the part of a science nut to a jock either. He fits the part nicely, although his odd smile will give me nightmares for weeks. Willem Dafoe is just the kind of villain that the big-name movie series need. He fits the role excellently. Perhaps the Bond series should invest in his talents at some point. I don't really think of Kirsten Dunst as much of an MJ. I think her days of acting teenagers are over, but it was a lovely performance none the less. Although one element I never expected to be included was - Amateur wrestling. God that sequence was funny. ^_^ One of the best movie theatre experiences I can say I ever had. Ranks up there with Resident Evil.
7.0~I'm Torn rosannamariastead Sign in Permalink I did like this film, I though it was cleverly made and well done. My problem was with the actors. I thought the casting of Aunt May was superb, she was what I expected of her, as was the green goblin, however, Tobey McGuire and Kirsten Dunst as the leads? I don't think so. I'd always imagined Peter Parker as butch but sweet-centred, McGuire was far too sensitive, however, I do think that he played it well, creating Parker that way, I just feel he was the wrong type for the role. Again, Kirsten Dunst was a strange choice I feel, she portrayed Mary-Jane as very needy and desperate, and on a more personal level, I didn't think she was really pretty enough to play her either. Howver, it was a well done film and worth a watch on a rainy afternoon.
10.0~One of the best of this year. Shahriar86 Sign in Permalink This film is one of the best film of this year. It surely lives upto its hype. I waited in line for about 3 hours to get in. Most people obviously knows the story so I won't go into details about that. The special effects in the movie was nicely done and the acting was really good too. Even if you are not a spiderman fan or not even a comic fan, I still highly recommend it. 9/10
1.0~Waste of my $8.50 wstarlne Sign in Permalink Honestly, I wasn't planning on seeing "Spider-Man" at all. However, the trailer looked interesting and the reviews were excellent. So, I decide to give in and go opening weekend (also because it was planning on so many screens it was difficult to find another reasonable show time. I really approached this movie with an open mind. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. The movie seemed about an hour too long, the acting was weak, the special effects were too compute looking, and the script was pathetic. I'm really sorry that I gave into all the hype, because it probably should have saved my money for another movie. If I hadn't paid $8.50 to go, I would have walked out.
10.0~Very emotionel ! carrie_manova Sign in Permalink I watch this movie on the premiere night, and It took my breath away. In the biggining, when I heard about Tobey playing Spiderman, I thought this would be strange, cause I never have seen an actionfilm with him in it, I always thought of him as a down to earth guy. But he plays the role exellent ! The film is loaded with great action scenes, love drama and secret's. You won't be disappointed, trust me ! I can't wait for the 2 and 3 film to come over the next couple of years !
8.0~Fantastic Spidey Action! kaisheng Sign in Permalink Went to the movie with high expectations and the movie gave me what I wanted and more! The unfolding of the plot was somewhat true to the comic although it was very much watered down. Yet, this is expected since the comic was multi-faceted and it would be unreasonable to expect the scriptwriters to include every single sub-plot and detail. The adaptation was just apt. Getting Tobey Maguire to play the part of the unassuming dorky Peter Parker was a good choice. He was excellent in his acting. However, William Dafoe's talents were under-utilised. His great calibre in acting was not fully developed in the film since his facial expressions were not visible under the green goblin's mask. Yet, these two actors did a fantastic job! It was a pity that Kirsten Dunst with her talent played a somewhat minor role in the movie. The visuals were eye candy with swift spidey swinging action! (And not to mention occasional TARZAN style screamin'.)It was great fun! The humour was good, and there was progress in character and relational development. A must see, especially for Marvel Comic fans.
7.0~Above average but only slightly Gubby-Allen Sign in Permalink Spiderman started off pretty well & had the makings of a good film but too much time was devoted to the romance as the film went on. I'd have liked a little more insight into Peter at the start before the biting but more than that, the start of Peters' / Spidermans' mission to help the public was glossed over far too quickly. One minute he was looking at the costume, within seconds it was days later & the city all knew about him. I'd have liked Spiderman to have been a little more comic book style like Superman, but nonetheless it's still a good film with some great scenes (and gaffes). A low 7/10
10.0~The origin of Spiderman WeAreLive Sign in Permalink This movie was really awesome I remember watching it a day after my 16th birthday and I was so happy because my 16th birthday didn't go as planned on the day, my dad was on a night shift and my mom was too tired so I decided to open my uncles birthday present and I got the first 3 Spiderman movies. If you love the comics you would love this movie. Tobey Maguire was awesome as Spiderman. I would say give it a go for the new generation of Spiderman fans.
7.0~Flawed. But still good. obiwan2005 Sign in Permalink And by flaws I don't mean Organic Web-shooters. People who whine about that need a life ASAP! I didn't like 'Spider-Man' at first. I felt there wasn't enough good action and ariel battle scenes. And the Green Goblin's costume was just terrible. But at second glance, the acting was great. Tobey Maguire is the perfect Peter Parker, and had great chemestry with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). And Willem Dafoe was also good. The beginning of the movie was very well done. Real faithful to the comic. But the scenes with MJ take away Spidey/Gobby action time. A bitter sweet trade I admit. Although these scenes had great emotion and depth and really defined the characters, I think they should have put equal amount of time and effort towards the action. Some of the action is laughable. The CG was pretty good though. But over all its a pretty good comic movie. But it could have been better. For an example of a perfect comic adaptation, look towards 'Daredevil'. RATING:*** out of ****
10.0~The origin of the most profitable franchise in history. bernestMak1 Sign in Permalink This was the movie that I watched the most as a kid. Still holds up today with a fantastic origin story and Shakespearean drama. I'm sure that this is the best Spider-Man we will ever see because Raimi is the perfect director for this source material. With his low budget background, Raimi knew how to make a great looking movie for pennies. Given millions of dollars, Raimi gave us a very modern looking move even for 2018. Sure, the fight during the parade and a couple other shots are sort of bad looking due to 2002 CGI, but you can look past it because they are few and far between. Attack of the Clones came out the same year and it's incredible how much this holds up compared to it. People complain about the actors not being actual teenagers, but it's something I've never really been bothered with. Tobey is the perfect Spider-Man, portraying every side of Peter Parker to a T. Dunst is alright as a damsel in distress, but nothing to write home about. Dafoe was unhinged as the goblin, and it makes me really wish that they used the makeup that they were originally planning on doing so we could see more of his performance. I like the mask in some scenes though, like when he puts Peter to sleep and talks to him on the rooftop. Showing just his eyes, he is so menacing in that scene to the point where it's sort of disturbing. Simmons plays a perfect Jameson and Franco is forgettable but not terrible. All in all, this film is a bonafide classic that's in the same vein as the first superman in the 70s and 1989s batman. To me, Spider-Man is to my generation what those movies were to previous generations. All 3 represent something extremely fun and new. This, along with X-Men a couple years before, really brought comic book movies into the limelight again after they were dying down in the late 90s. This is a movie that I will be returning to for the rest of my life and one that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good time.
8.0~The birth of light-hearted Superhero films davidcreighton Sign in Permalink Before this movie came out, we pretty much only had the X-men, and the Burtons Batman movies (that were good in my opinion). But as soon as this came out it showed that superhero movies can be light hearted and still make you shed a tear, pump your fists and give you those dark moments. Green Goblin was great for the time. i would have love a more mutated version of him but what we got was amazing. and DeFoe doing his own stunts 95% of the time is incredible wish he would have web-shooters but the organic ones are fine all in all this is one of the best superhero origin movies one could ask for!
9.0~Wonderful portrayal of the Characters tshodan Sign in Permalink Spiderman was a well done comic to movie event. On the plus side, the characters were all but perfect. Tobie Maguire pulls off Peter Parker extremely well and Wilhem Dafoe was born to play Norman Osbourne. If this wasn't a movie based on a comic book, he would be up for an Oscar. However, expect him to win the MTV Best Villain award (even though he will be competing against Christopher Lee 2X for that one. Sauraman from The Lord of the Rings and Darth Tyranus from Clones.) Kirsten Dunst and the Director put a slightly new twist on MJ, but it's in the right direction. Personally this is the first rendition cartoon, comic or movie were I enjoyed the Aunt May character. On the down side (but not too far down) the special effects were just OK. The Computer animation was second rate by todays standards and somehow it lessoned the presence of Spiderman on the Screen. The Green Goblins costume was a little too much like Jet jaguar from Godzilla fame for my liking. The enjoyment from this movie comes mostly from the real life characters and aliases and not from when our hero and villain are suited up. Despite this, I still gave it a 9. I cant see were I can knock it any further than that.
8.0~A great adaptation. A great movie. k-dhesi Sign in Permalink Comic or marvel lovers will definitely favourite this one. A nice and simple adaptation to a legendary cartoon to a soon to be legendary movie. A delightful action film to watch with your family or friends. It's a fun action, adventure with some dilemmas and romance. A not so "big familiar cast" have to step up for this one and even though they are not formally the talk of the town, they did a very decent job in playing there roles. Partically Tobey Maguire, He gave that touch that the "Spider man" character needed. Even though it made an outstanding achievement, it lacked on something quite big. But we can discuss that later, for now let's discuss the good: The plot was quite the one. A nerdy young adult, a pushover and a victim for the bully's. Get's bitten by a spider which combines the special feature in the spider ( like the ability to climb, jump further, speed, spider strength and obviously ability to make webs.) with the human features ( human strength. etc) So as you surely should already know Spider Man is obviously a hero with super hero powers. During the movie spider man comes across with a villain as you would expect, so yes loads of fighting and limited action. Yes very limited, no real gore, swearing or shooting. But the action is well panned out and executed well. Some effects were quite cool too. The designers did very well indeed, costumes were perfect. The script was also good, it was witty and clever especially a scene towards the end and the famous line "With great power comes great responsibility." Now.lets discuss the one main thing it lacked. Without spoiling it for anyone that has not yet seen this movie. Peter Parker comes to use his powers a bit to quick. There should be a 10 to 20 minutes were Peter is still trying to test his powers and realising what he is capable off. It is some doubt in his head about his powers as he confused on what's going on. But his knowledge of the powers come a bit to quick. Nothing really major, but still something that could have made the rating go up 2 more! Overall I'm sure many of you have seen this film already but if you haven't. It's wonderful in many ways. It's cool, funny/witty, its got a decent amount of enjoyable action and some nice special effects. The best super hero movie of it's genre and great adaptation and a highly enjoyable flick.
8.0~One of the best movies ever!!! mdm224 Sign in Permalink Hands down Spider-Man is one of the best movies I've ever seen it has every thing a movie could want,its a thriller, its a love story, it's a action film, it has comedy.I suggest that you should see it you havent NOW!!!!.
7.0~Great if you don't mind spiders and heights jools B Sign in Permalink Good Hollywood action movie, enjoyable within its limits. Great performance by Willem Defoe as Green Goblin. The romantic subplot dragged a bit but otherwise no complaints really for this kind of movie. See it on the big screen if you can.
10.0~More than I could have hoped for!!!! Helto1 Sign in Permalink This movie is everything and anything a Spider-man fan could have asked for. Tobey Maguire was perfectly cast as Peter Parker, Kirsten Dunst was stunning as Mary Jane, and Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborne worked to perfection. All the action was great, the fights were well choreographed, the cgi was tasteful, not overdone. But most of all, they kept as close to the story as I could have hoped for. I've been reading/collecting Spider-man for a while now, and getting to see my favorite hobby come to screen, with such success, has been thrilling for me. I can't wait for the sequel!!!!
6.0~On its own, a decent movie...with the Spider-Man name attached...not so decent 490 Sign in Permalink I have been a huge fan of Spider-Man for as long as I can remember. When I first heard there were plans for a movie, I knew it was going to be amazing. Well, I'm amazed at the fact that I was wrong. I don't know what in particular screwed this up so badly. I just can't put my finger on it. Maybe it's the fact that I expected this movie to truly amaze me, and my expectations were a little to high. Five years ago, this movie would've amazed me. That is, it would've amazed me because I didn't recognize bad movies. Five years ago I didn't realize how truly bad Batman & Robin was. I guess this movie was made for kids, but they should've thought about the teens and adults who grew up with Spidey and thought that maybe he grew up too. How could it have been better? Here are just a few suggestions: 1) Don't change the bloody costumes or powers- the Green Goblin was NOT supposed to make me laugh, but it did. And what was the point of making web-shooting an integrated power instead of an invention?? If it came with the powers, realistically, it would come out of Peter's arse. 2) Make the movie darker. It's too happy; Spider-Man is supposed to be a little darker inside. There was way too little thought about Uncle Ben's famous words: "With great power comes great responsibility". Spidey is supposed to be dwelling on this philosophy waaay more. 3) It's a simple boy-meets-girl-and-falls-in-love-then-gets-superpowers plot, which even in the comics demonstrated little depth. I just thought maybe they could explore his uniquely teen mentality more, get into Peter's psychology. After all, his mind, flaws and truely human frailty is what attracted most of his fans. Overall, the film just didn't go deep enough. But this is coming from a person who expects movies of this caliber to be really, really good. Overall, this is an okay movie to watch with pizza and some friends, and that's about it. I must admit, it's interesting to finally see Spidey in live action, and it'll be interesting to see Doc Oc and the Lizard on film (and possible Venom or Carnage in the third movie, which I'm sure they'll make). I give Spider-Man a 6 or 7 out of 10. Hopefully they'll remake the Spidey movie in 20 years...I'll make it a personal goal to live to see a Spider-Man movie adaptation I truly love.
10.0~A Perfect Comic Book Adaptaion fumanstan Sign in Permalink This movie succeeds on many levels by doing what other comic book movies of late fail to do (X-Men, Blade, Blade 2, Batman and Robin). Spider-Man establishes a certain charm to each of its characters that actually makes you feel for the plight of Peter Parker, Mary Jane, Norman Osborn, and Harry Osborn. X-Men was constrained by its short running time, failing to establish the segregation between humans and mutants as well the emotions of the individual X-Men (except Wolvernie and possibly Rogue). Blade swereved toward the direction of an outright action flick, with fight scenes to overcome the lack of personality in Wesley Snipes character. Spider-Man however provides what these other movies lack, a combination of character development and action that allows it to please a wide range of movie-goers. While Tobey Maguire often lacks emotion in his speeches (both his outburst against Uncle Ben and the final scene with Mary Jane), the awkwardness he displays works surprisingly well as Parker. Willem Dafoe played the psychological aspects of Norman Osborne/Green Goblin to perfection, and his rant to himself infront of the mirror shows not only his range as an actor, but the complexity of a comic book character. Spider-Man did not attempt to overwhelm the audience with a myriad of special effects and action sequences, it built up to them for just the right climax accompanied by emotion. This movie is a 10, and no question as to why it broke box office records.
8.0~Rare summer blockbuster that not only lives up to expectations but surpasses them zetes Sign in Permalink Frankly, a serious, realistic film version of Spider-Man is an impossibility. How, pray tell, does one make a movie with a character like The Green Goblin or Dr. Octopus without making the audience laugh? That's why Sam Raimi was the absolute perfect director for the Spider-Man movie. He's got the most uncanny ability to entertain the heck out of the audience while they are laughing at how tremendously silly the whole thing is. This comes from the Evil Dead section of his career. Now, from the more recent side of his career, like The Gift and A Simple Plan, Raimi brings the ability to people Spider-Man with good characters. Some of them are straight from the comic book, sure. Rosemary Harris' Aunt May is a perfect version of that character. And Willem Defoe's Osbourne/Green Goblin. He's so cartoonish, well, let me reserve a special place later on to talk about Defoe's performance. Now, Peter Parker, Mary Jane, and Harry Osbourne (Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco respectively) are amazingly well realized. I did the same double take that everyone else did when they heard that Tobey Maguire was cast as Spiderman. Huh? That kid from The Ice Storm? Well, he's been very good in several movies (he was also poorly cast in a few movies, too, especially The Cider House Rules), and Raimi obviously cast him because of his acting skills. He could have went for the kid from Dawson's Creek or something, but he was right to get someone who could actually act. Kirsten Dunst may be the most underrated actress out there right now. She's been in some for-the-money projects, surely, and this is another one that'll pay her big. But in the meantime she lands some great roles, things like The Virgin Suicides and Crazy/Beautiful. Even the weak stuff she improves simply by her presence. Spider-Man isn't one of her best performances, but she's good. I like the early stuff, her problems with her terrible parents. It's actually kind of disappointing that they leave that character baggage almost completely behind Mary Jane after they graduate and move into the city. She is more or less relegated into the role of damsel in distress at that point. James Franco, who plays Harry Osbourne, is exceptional. I believe that his character becomes a super villain in the comic book, and that suggestion is left with us at the end of this film. He projects a lot of personality, more than his character actually has in the script. Now for Willem Defoe. No, he's not bad. Exactly the opposite. This is where the film goes way over-the-top, deliciously so. The Green Goblin is a great villain. He's nearly at the same level as Jack Nicholson's The Joker. Willem Defoe has a ton of great scenes, both as Osbourne and as The Green Goblin. I love the seen where he has a conversation with his evil mirror reflection. Critics are kind of complaining about Defoe's performance, but I think it's perfect for the film. Another great comic-book performance comes from J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, the newspaper publisher with whom Peter Parker sells his Spider-Man photographs. His scenes are the best in the film. Hope he has even more next time! My only real complaints about the film are the generous steals from the first Tim Burton Batman film (the balloon parade attack) and The Matrix (the fire sequence). There are so many inventive sequences that it's unfortunate that they couldn't come up with two more original ones. Spider-Man, despite its small flaws, is the perfect example of summer entertainment. I am seriously considering seeing it again in the theater, something I never do for this kind of film. It's probably the only time that I walked out of the theater wondering why the sequel was taking so long to make! Word to Raimi fans: both Bruce Campbell and Ted Raimi. They both have hilarious cameos.
8.0~Hugely Entertaining. AaronCapenBanner Sign in Permalink Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker/Spider-man with a sense of wonder and fun that he became the perfect choice for the role, though Willem Dafoe as his mentor turned nemesis Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin is equally good. James Franco as Harry Osbourne and Kirsten Dunst as love interest Mary Jane Watson round out a fine cast. Witty script captures the knowing self-awareness of superheroes and villains, and their place in a society that may accept, then later reject them. Director Sam Raimi clearly loves this character, and brings this material to life in grand fashion, with a memorable climax and final scene that sets up the franchise beautifully. One of the best comic book films ever made was a big hit, and became a trilogy.
1.0~couldve been a great film, but... LoveCoates Sign in Permalink spiderman was so frustrating for me, because it was halfway there. it takes a script with dialogue and characters so ridiculous it begs to be presented as total fun, action-filled camp like the old batman television series. instead, the filmmakers took it too seriously, and tried to take a sophisticated approach, like the batman movies. the result is a confusing, relentlessy-mediocre film in which the audience doesn't know what to feel. everything is hybrid. you have peter's uncle, who is a serious character, then you have his aunt delivering camp lines like "eviiil! eeeeviiil!" you have a well-done spiderman costume next to a green goblin that looks a kids' action figure. is mary jane supposed to be a funny stereotype, or is the character just badly-written? we never know. people have blamed kirsten dunst for being a bad actress, but who could possibly deliver such lines as "I better run, tiger!" with any degree of competence? this is one of the dumbest roles ever written for a female actor of any generation. i doubt most respectable actresses would fire their agent if even offered the role, which is a throwback to the kind of girlfriend's you'd find i a 30s B-movie. i applaud kirsten for even trying. this is the perfect example of what happens to a script after its been through development hell. this movie had floated around hollywood since the 80s, too many people put their version on it, and the result is just "blah." neither good nor bad, this is the kind of movie you see and never think about again, or the kind you love as a child and then deny later on. no wonder James Cameron, Ang Lee, Jan DeBont and David Fincher all declined to direct the script. it really is bad. sam raimi, a very capable director, nearly saves it with his refreshing sense of style, but he didnt go far enough. it's not bad, it's not good, it's your typical 5/10. yawn.
8.0~I hated the Goblin's mask feo_1 Sign in Permalink As for the rest of the movie it was pretty good. Especially Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker. That's all I ask of you film makers and actors; make me believe. But seriously the entire Green Goblin costume was egregiously stupid and unimaginative. As a Spider-Man fan for years one thing about the movie bugs me to no end: Was Kirsten Dunst supposed to be the overtly beautiful, future model MJ that everyone drools over? She was not even close. I hope Kate Hudson or Alicia Witt as Gwen Stacy shows up in the next movie. One question: How does Spider-Man shoot webs through his costume? Make me believe.
9.0~Good, but not great chungsk Sign in Permalink After the first viewing, I thought it was a 10/10. Second time, 9.5/10. Third time, 8.5/10. A list of the good and the bad: The good: 1. The acting. I love Willem Dafoe. He is the most versatile actor I've ever seen. Tobey Maguire was decent and cute. Kirsten Dunst is pretty enough and has enough charm and spunk to pull off the MJ character. And J.K. Simmons was excellent! (Call the patent office. I want a quarter every time someone says Green Goblin! that was really funny) 2. The script. It was good (not Oscar worthy) but entertaining with only a few holes. Although some of Maguire's monologues to Dunst were mediocre. Someone was actually laughing at the scene in the hospital when Maguire tells Dunst that he told Spiderman she was beautiful, etc, etc. 3. Director. Raimi does a great job of getting his characters to work together. He really brings Spiderman to life. The webslinging scenes were especially good. 4. Music. Danny Elfman was really good. His music was on cue, unlike Williams, who had good music, but it wasn't on cue at all. 5. Willem Dafoe! 'Itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout, down came the goblin and wiped the spider out. 6. Cool CGI, even if SW: the Clones had better CGI, Spiderman's was more believable and less rowdy and crowded. The bad: SPOILERS 1. Plot holes become more and more visible each time you watch it. Such as, if Parker had to sign a consent form at the wrestling match and show his face, wouldn't someone recognize him as Spiderman later on? 2. I was just wondering how Parker managed to get the Green Goblin's suit off of Norman after he died, and why wasn't he bleeding? Ok, I'm not a science major so fill me in please. 3. MJ realizes something after kissing Parker in the funeral scene. So, why doesn't she run after him? Hello? 4. Of course, just like Superman, it's obvious Parker is Spiderman but that's part of almost all superhero stories. 5. Why doesn't the Green Goblin pull off Spiderman's mask when he knocks him out with gas? It'd be a whole lot easier to get him on your side! 6. Why didn't MJ go after Harry in high school if she wanted a rich boy? Well then again, I think Flash Thompson had some money. 7. This one person in my theatre was laughing at all the Green Goblin scenes when Norman is battling his split personality. That can't be good, can it? Even though I thought Dafoe did a memorable job. 8. MJ really would have had died in the final confrontation scene, ie her arms would have popped out when she fell like fifty feet. 9. Batman is more cool because he's more human and more vulnerable. In any case, I'm not trying to fight with the SW fans, but Spiderman is really a whole lot better than the Clones. It's not perfect but I was entertained. Can't wait for the sequel! 8.5/10
8.0~One of the best films of 2002! wuzupn_tb Sign in Permalink Hollywood movies like this haven't been around in a while. It's a comedy/superhero movie that kicked off the whole SuperHero movie craze in the new millennium. You WILL be entertained. A-, 8/10
9.0~16 years later and I still feel completely satisfied charbelelaro Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is directed by Sam Raimi and is the origin story to the character of Peter Parker. Tobey Maguire who was casted for the lead role delivers such an authentic performance. Peter is everything from intelligent to painfully awkward, and at times can be the most relatable marvel hero. The great cast portray characters who are perfectly established due to the impressive script. Particularly Willem Dafoe who is phenomenal. He truly embodies the Green Goblin, delivering such a complex and horrifying villain, who contains personal ties to Peter Parker. Sam Raimi's creative voice comes through beautifully, as he focuses on vibrant visuals as well as a real emphasis on the human nature behind Spider-Man. At times this film can be incredibly emotional, where you find yourself caring so deeply for these comic book characters. But above all that Spider-Man contains such exciting action sequences and climatic finale which greatly impacts our hero on both sides of his identity. 16 years later and I still feel completely satisfied by Raimi's portrayal of this iconic Marval hero. Spider-Man set the benchmark for all superhero origin stories, delivering an experience of high quality and undeniable enjoyment. Its a strong start to the trilogy so therefore I give it a 9.
10.0~10 Stars. The best action movie since The Matrix! kluvlaw Sign in Permalink I gave this movie ten stars because it is as good as movies like Crouching Tiger or Traffic, in that it captures what it intends to capture. Those stories were brilliantly acted pieces dealing with simple peoples lives and the movies showed those stories extremely well within the style of their own genre. Likewise, this movie captures what the action movie genre is supposed to capture(the audience's attention from start to finish). There is continuous action, but never at the expense of developed characters and good storytelling. These character's depth can be attributed to the script which clearly wants to make this movie have mass appeal, (which, for once is a good thing). What I mean by this, is that the script includes background and important facts about each person (much better than x-men for example), so this isn't just a movie that appeals to the die hard Spiderman fan. Once the characters have depth and are continually forced to deal with tragic situations they become easy to care about in this VERY WELL acted film. It separates itself from most other action movies (which I generally dislike) because it is more than a medium to feed an audience special effects. "Spiderman" is actual storytelling, was incredibly humorous (in keeping with the comic book's style of storytelling), and refreshing. There is no need to be a 16 year old comic book collector to enjoy this film. The whole audience was clapping and cheering by the films credits. It exceeded all my expectations!! P.S.- My wife, who knew nothing Spiderman's history, was very impressed by the character development and solid acting because both made her care about the lives of these people.
9.0~Fabulous Movie blazaugg Sign in Permalink The Fight scenes were great, Incredible Special effects, good introduction to the story of Spider-man, the dialogue between Mary jane and Peter Parker dragged at a few points but over all it was great, Will do big business!! The casting of Tobey was great, at first I had my doubts but its so good that it wasn't the typical hunky guy. He did well.
7.0~The Hollywood Spider-Man Justin-MacLean Sign in Permalink First and foremost, let me just say, I support Hollywood making "comic book" movies. Then let me add that "Spider-Man" was my favorite "comic book superhero" for a number of years! However, what lacked in this film was the character himself, "Spider-Man". Tobey McGuire performance as Peter Parker was a 9 out of 10, but as Spider-Man.......ehh..... Now don't mistaken me, it's NOT Tobey's fault, but the writer & more importantly the "overrated" director Sam Ramni. The MAIN reason why the comic book character Spider-Man has been around for 40 plus years, is because of his "sense of humor". No matter how many times you watch Spider-Man, there's no "Wise Cracks" from our hero. Other things didn't work too for me. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. I was excited at first when I heard she'd be portraying Mary Jane, but I can tell you, the name in the movie might have been "MJ", but IT CERTAINLY WASN'T MJ from the comics that I loved. William Dafoe did a GREAT job, Tobbey, & the actor who portrayed J.J. Jameson, but with a new Writer, Director, & Mary Jane, this can actually be the Amazing Spider-Man, oppose to Hollywood Spider-Man.
7.0~My 2 pence mart7076 Sign in Permalink At the time I couldn't take my 2 children to see the film so I went myself one afternoon wish I had my kids with me as they would have enjoyed it more than I did and perhaps I would have enjoyed it more to. IMO Spiderman is defo one for the kids to rate this a 12 was crazy how did they come up a 12 and not a PG Lord of the rings was IMO more violent and that got a PG rating, the thing is now that the certification has been reduced my two kids want to go see it and I don't fancy sitting threw it again.
8.0~A now classic superhero film that set a standard for the genre swilliky Sign in Permalink Spider-man is my favorite superhero and the films really brought him to life in various forms. I am a fan of almost every cinematic representation but the initial film truly brought the hero to life for me. I remember seeing this film on opening day back in 2002 after anticipating it for months. The film begins with a voice-over narration by Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) as he's just a dorky high school kid though a brilliant mind who reads research on nanotechnology. He's late to catch the bus for a field trip to a spider research facility and is tripped when caught staring at his crush Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). Also attending the trip is the wealthy high school kid Harry Osborn (James Franco) who is a disappointment to his father Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe). While taking a picture of Mary Jane, Peter is bitten by a genetically modified super spider. Norman Osborn works at Oscorp to develop a glider, an exoskeleton suit, and a super soldier performance-enhancing serum but risks losing funding without successful human trials. At Peter's home, Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) worry about their financial stability and Peter who comes home sick. Norman moves ahead with the human trial testing it on himself but it drives him crazy and he kills a researcher. Peter wakes up to find he has strange power like better eyesight, a ripped body, faster reflexes, and a strange webbing coming out of his wrists. When the bully Flash Thompson (Joe Manganiello) tries to fight him, Peter easily outmaneuvers him and punches him across the hall. He begins to experiment with his newfound abilities, crawling, jumping and swinging around buildings. The oddest thing about this film is the natural web shooting out of his arms, which at first, I thought wasn't so strange but didn't realize this was not the original way it was written in the comics.

8.0~GOOD movie rvtjm5 Sign in Permalink The hype going into this movie was unbelievable!I thought that there was NO WAY this movie could stand up to "all the buzz" flying around.But you know what...I believe it might just have pulled it off.The group I was in were ages 38,37,19,18,13,and 12(2 guys & 4 gals) and ALL of us thoroughly enjoyed it!The special effects were "sweet".Trust me on this one,GO WATCH THIS MOVIE.
5.0~Poor Casting rachelmnop Sign in Permalink I have been reading Spiderman ever since i knew how to read, and i would say i know the comic well. That being said i have never seen a movie so poorly cast. Peter Parker is supposed to be nerdy, but also an in-shape, somewhat with it New Yorker. His nerd side is supposed to be there, but he gains a lot of confidence after becoming Spiderman. He is also supposed to be WITTY and make clever and funny remarks all the time, but most notably during fight scenes. By eliminating this aspect they made Spiderman and Peter Parker an extremely flat character. I can't even say anything about Mary Jane, there are no words to describe how horrific she is in these movies, it is an ultimate disaster.
2.0~Bitter disappointment Andy Stehr Sign in Permalink I was looking forward to seeing Spider-Man for months, and when I finally got to see it, I was bitterly disappointed. I felt the plot was overly complicated, the characters had no motivation for most of their actions, and the special effects seemed silly instead of amazing. I thought the acting was great, and I thought the first twenty minutes of the film were pretty good, but then things went down hill fast. I'm really baffled because everyone else I talked to loved it. I just wanted to voice my dislike of the movie, so all the other people out there who didn't like it know they are not only. By the way the comics have been excellent lately.
10.0~With Great Power comes Great Responsibility XweAponX Sign in Permalink By default, Comic Books are the perfect Pre-Viz for movies made based on them. And as a long-time Spidey fan, I was able to see the panels of this comic book come to striking life, sometimes reproduced with magnificent exactness in comparison to the way the books have been drawn and colored. As far as this initial offering goes, the choices of Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Willem Dafoe and James Franco allowed for an almost precise match to how the characters they each portray looked in the books. The casting of Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt Mae, and J.K. Simmons as J Jonah Jameson: But it was not just the casting of actors who very closely resemble the characters of the Spider-man Universe, it was clearly Sam Raimi's direction in concert with the script by David Koepp based very closely on Stan Lee's "Spidey" Origin Story, which made these people come alive and pop out of the comic book frames, almost into real life. Compared to some of the other Marvel universe movies, this one was done with the most amount of care and respect for the series. Just to reproduce the postures of the flying web-slinger, using some of the most famous frames from the comics, was an astounding accomplishment. From his humble beginnings in "Evil Dead" Sam Raimi has been a clever filmmaker, especially in his ability to make splendid visual effects. Combine that with a huge budget along with Visual Effects god John Dykstra, who designed effects for Star Trek: The Motion Pic and the original Star Wars, back when it was still called that. Connect the dots with a fantastic Production Designer and Costume Designer, and it all just worked. One of the tests of how well Digital Effects have been done are in the viewing of these films on lower-resolution mediums, like smart phone screens and Old Cathode-Ray Tube TV's. I've viewed this film in each of those, and when Spidey is crawling up a wall in an obvious CGI shot, it makes you wonder if it really was CGI: In films like Daredevil, it is easy to spot the transition frames; here, it is impossible to find it. Comparatively, the work on Captain America showing Steve Rogers as a skinny kid is very clever. Here, the same tech is used in a smaller degree to show Parker as a wimpy, skinny nerd. This is highly effective so that when Parker sees himself buffed out with his shirt off, you believe a change has occurred. Where this film excels is in the rapidity of which it gets into the Spider-Man story, which is within the first ten minutes. As much as I do like the new Marc Webb "Amazing Spider Man" (2012) - It takes much too long to get into it, although the character development in that film is very good. In this film however, the character development continues through the film and is incorporated even into action sequences, Continuing up to the very last frame of the film. Ted Raimi, Bruce Campbell and Dan Hicks (Of Dan Hicks and his Hot Licks) are all inserted as cameo properly as with any Raimi film. It is Campbell himself who "names" Spider-man - Saying "The Human Spider? That Sucks!" My few complaints revolve around the character of Peter Parker, who is fairly unlucky in the books, here he is a walking disaster area. He is the antithesis of "The Competent Man" and even when given extraordinary ability, he is still a wimp in his personality, especially in his dealing with Mary Jane Watson. Also, Peter Parker's first Love interest was Gwen Stacy, and it was she, not MJ who The Green Goblin captured and gave Spidey the choice: Save these kids in the Cable-Car, or Save Gwen. It was a choice, and one or the other only could have been saved. Here, Gwen is absent totally, and he saves MJ with a feat even impossible for the comic- book rendition of Spidey. But I suppose adding Gwen to the mix would have muddied up the water too much. And even though I did not like the distortion of that original classic story, they did reproduce it visually with astounding correctness, as they did with the images of Spider-Man flying through NYC. Animating several classic Steve Ditko Spidey Postures, and at the end of the film we get to see many of these animated fantastically. But the main message: 'With Great power, comes Great Responsibility" - As told by Uncle Ben to Peter right before his death, survives, and when coupled to Danny Elfman's main Theme, makes this a powerful, meaningful film.
8.0~The Sort of Movie That Makes Life Great. Zombie-Kermit Sign in Permalink This movie is great in almost every way. This is one of the movies that helped get me into all the comic book stuff when I was in my early teens. Well, the character of Spider-Man anyway. Now, six years on, Spider-Man is one of my favourite comic book characters and Stan Lee is one of my heroes. It gives a really good origin story in the beginning that stays pretty true to the comics for the most part. Sure there were changes made to the story in some parts, but it was still pretty close. The origin carries into a pretty solid plot, which really works as a Spider-Man movie. The acting was really good, and I felt the actors all portrayed their characters well. I thought that Tobey Macguire made a really good Peter Parker and a decent Spider-Man, James Franco was really good as Harry Osborne, and I think I'm one of the few people that thinks Kirsten Dunst made an alright Mary Jane Watson. They all had great chemistry together. You could really imagine that Mary Jane was the girl that Peter loved, and that Harry was his best friend. The father/son relationship between Harry and Norman Osborne was pretty believable. All the actors just worked really well together, and I believe good chemistry works really well toward making a good movie. Even the supporting characters are perfectly cast, like Uncle Ben, Aunt May, J Jonah Jameson and Betty Brant seemed as if they were straight out of the comics. The storyline is pretty cool. It's filled with lots of drama, when you get to see Peter feeling different things throughout the movie. Guilt, love, confusion. You get to see the transformation of a nerdy, weak teenager into a powerful hero. It's not just about some kid who gets bitten by a spider and becomes a superhero, it's got a whole lot more depth than that. And for the most part, the actual storyline doesn't just feel like filler until the next action scene. That's part of what sets it apart from a lot of other comic book movies. Some of the dialog in the movie is a bit cheesy, especially some of the stuff between Peter and Mary Jane, but I don't really let it bug me. The action scenes are really good, although a little fleeting for the most part. They just seemed over too soon sometimes. They were still really cool though, and were definitely some of the high points of the movie. The costume designs are really good as well. The Spider-Man costume looks awesome in about 132 different ways. Apparently the changes that were made to the Green Goblin costume in comparison to his comic counterpart caused some problems with fans. I think the changes were necessary to avoid being too cheesy. And his new costume looked awesome anyway. The special effects in the movie were pretty good, especially in scenes where Spidey is swinging around. There are some scenes where it does look a little fake, but it shouldn't take away from the movie for people. But I know people do like to whine about every problems in movies, so some people might find the effects an issue. All in all, it's an awesome movie, and we were lucky enough to get two sequels to it. I've watched it a few times, and it holds up well. A fairly re-watchable movie. It was one of the movies that helped start the modern Marvel movie trend, along with X-Men and the Blade movies before it. Just another great thing it had a hand in. Sam Raimi is a great director. Spider-Man is a great character and was really done justice in a movie that could have easily been awful.
10.0~Awesome! JoJo_2001 Sign in Permalink I admit that I never read the comic books, and I probably only saw an episode or two of the cartoon, but I absolutely loved this movie! I thought the best parts were the special effects and some of the camera shots. The cast all did a fantastic job, but I especially loved Toby Maguire, Willem Dafoe, and Kirsten Dunst. I thought the story was pretty good. Usually, I really don't like superhero films that much, but I was glued to the screen during this one. I was so thirsty, but I sat there for the entire movie and suffered because I didn't want to miss anything. I highly recommend it to everyone.
10.0~Breath Taking GreenLantern519 Sign in Permalink I have to agree. The Spider Man movie was execellent. I amount of special effects used were just the right amount I dont think that Sam would use too many special effects as George Lucas may in his up comming movie. Tobey Maguire was a perfect fit for Spider Man he's a young actor and if any one else were to play spider man I think that it may reuin the movie. There was only one thing I didnt reall like about this movie. The full ending, it was a little too odd. Although I now heard that original full ending was to have taken place on top of the World Trade Center and Sam had to take it out and re-do the ending scenes. The final scene was fine for my taste. The only reason is , is that Sam is writing a sequal now and had to end the movie so the general public would want more. Over all it was very good and I cant wait for the next one hopefully next year.
8.0~Very good introduction to Spider-man SnoopyStyle Sign in Permalink Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy high school student who has a crush on his next door neighbor Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). His only friend may be Harry Osborn (James Franco), the son of wealthy inventor Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe). On a field trip to Oscorp, Peter gets bitten by a genetically modified spider, and he develops powers to become Spider-man. Meanwhile Norman is desperate to prove his formula for human performance to the military. When he test it on himself, it corrupts his mind and turns him into the Green Goblin. Sam Raimi has created a very good introduction to Spider-man. The actors are all very capable and fit their characters. Willem Dafoe is amazing as Green Goblin. The only minor complaint is the web slinging ability. It's a major change to comic lore, but I understand the reason. I always liked Peter Parker because he was the underdog nerd. So it's a great thing that this series starts off well. And who doesn't love an upside down kiss in the rain?
10.0~Awesome movie! Chelsea Smith Sign in Permalink I was debating whether or not I wanted to see this movie, and I finally decided to go because my friend wanted to go, too. I was really glad I decided to go!! It was a great movie. Great casting: Kirsten Dunst wonderfully represented MJ Watson, Willem Dafoe was a great Green Goblin/Norman Osborne, and Tobey Maguire was an EXCELLENT choice for Spider-Man!! I didn't mind the fact that they changed the webbing from "cartridges" to just coming out of his hand. The only thing I can really think of that they might have done better on is the conversations between Peter and MJ. Great movie altogether, I would recommend it to any superhero fans.
10.0~Great movie dunit013-2 Sign in Permalink I wasn't even a fan of Spiderman until I saw the movie. But, I wanted to see it anyway.( I was 8). And, I loved it. I still like this movie. It sticks to the story, the acting is great, the special effects are awesome. Sam Raimi couldn't have made better casting calls. Although both sequels are superior to this one, it's still a hell of a good movie. I like the Green Goblin costume in the movie a lot more than the one he wears in the comics. The final showdown between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin is filled with action and suspense and ends with the Green Goblin getting impaled on the glider( which actually happened in the comics). My point is: don't die without seeing this.
7.0~Amateurish atzimo Sign in Permalink I just wanted to start off by saying that after the release of Spider-Man, Sam Raimi seems a lot less talented to me than he did before. And the reason is that he didn't manage to ultimately have control over the final look of the movie. He gave the computer guys complete autonomy for all the action sequences and that ruined the whole thing. 'Superman' (1979) looked a thousand times more real (just because he WAS real). You can immediately tell when a shot contains digital elements, especially when Spider-man moves, where he is always a frame faster than a real character. You know why? It's because in normal speed it would be even easier to tell that the hero is a CGI guy. It's a real trap that only an extremely talented director can escape of. James Cameron or Paul Verhoeven could easily pull this off for instance. Anyway I am deeply disappointed because in 2002 we could do a lot better with a digital character who has no facial features and no hair. Sad... 5/10
10.0~The best film to start the summer! videofreak2002 Sign in Permalink "Spider-Man," directed by the great Sam Raimi, is so good that I have a loss of words. Here's what I'm gonna say. It's alot better than "X-Men." But, it's in the same area with "The Crow" series, the "Blade" series, the "Superman" series, and the "Batman" series. This is Sam Raimi's best film to date (his best was the "Evil Dead" series). Tobey Macguire was the perfect choice to play Peter Parker. David Koepp, who recently wrote the hit "Panic Room," did such a good job staying very faithful to the comic books and Sam also did a good job not dissappointing the "Spider-Man" fans. Also, my favorite composer, Danny Elfman, did an excellent job orchestrating the music to this movie. William Dafoe was wonderful as Norman Osborn (a.k.a. "The Green Goblin). But, the best thing about the movie was Kirsten Dunst. My all-time favorite actress who I admired watching from being a girl ("Interview With The Vampire," "Little Women," "Jumanji," etc.), to being all grown up ("Crazy/Beautiful," "Drop Dead Gorgeous," "The Crow: Salvation," "Bring It On," "The Virgin Suicides," etc.) did such a marvelous, marvelous job playing Peter's love interest, Mary Jane Watson, I wanna see what she's gonna do next. If you wanna start the summer off with a big bang before "Star Wars" opens, then I'd reccommend you guys to see "Spider-Man." Also, I've been hearing about a sequel that's gonna be released next year, so, pay attention. A+ 13/13 ****** (out of ****** stars)
1.0~??? LoveCoates Sign in Permalink i dont know what to say. this movie...was horrible. the most predictable, fake-looking piece of hogwash...i have no explanation for the money it's making...this makes millions and the others and moulin rogue dont...im...speechless...
1.0~It's either strictly a kids film, or just a bad film Dan-Bowes Sign in Permalink Mabye kids like this film. But the simple fact is that it just doesn't measure up to the hype it's got, or the range of other great films coming out/out this summer. The visual effects are good but director Sam Raimi used them to carry the movie and ,as we all know from AI, that just doesn't work. The acting could have been much worse, the best comming from Willem Dafoe, he had a difficult role to play but managed to stop it becoming to corney and instantly forgettable (unlike that stupid green costume he had to wear). Toby Maguire and Kirstin Dunst could, and should have been much better, with Maguire seemingly unable to carry the movie by himself as all leading actors should do, and throughout the film he didn't really seem to always be in character and this let him and the film down. But something that should have been so much better was the cinamatography which should have been short sharp shots during the fight scenes, to really capture the action. Instead we had a steady-cam sat at a distance just like the audience and at a time when they need to be surrounded by action it just didn't happen. In conclusion, don't make a second one unless it's going to be better and if it's going to be an action movie, put more action in it, if it's going to be a romantic film, have more romance in it e.t.c Oh and it was way too long!
7.0~What's all the fuss about? DjSmitty20 Sign in Permalink I really do not understand the hype that surrounded this movie prior to its release. Sure, the comics were good and the cartoon was always good when I was a kid. But was this movie really that good? Did it deserve to make $400 million in North America alone? God no! The acting was ok and I think McGuire was a good choice for Parker. But the real shiner in this movie is Willem Dafoe. He excells in these types of roles, and he pretty much made the movie for me. Without him, Spiderman would be lucky to get a 5/10 from me. The action sequences, now let's be honest, were few and far between and the special effects were absolutely horrible. John Dykstra (of Star Wars fame back in the day) really should have stayed with Lucas' ILM. I haven't seen very obvious fake-looking effects since the dragons in that horrible film Dungeons and Dragons. Spiderman and the G. Goblin looked like cartoons. Anyway, the two movies being touted as blockbusters this summer were Spiderman and of course, Star Wars Episode 2 Attack of the Clones. The latter was a far superior movie, with a better story and MUCH better SFX. I realy don't understand how Americans can see Spiderman more than once, because that is what is necessary for a film to make over 400 million dollars in two months. Repeat viewings for Spiderman? It surely did not warrant it. An okay summer film, which I'll probably never watch again. I just did not understand the hype at all! 6/10
9.0~The first superhero movie to get it right Movie_Muse_Reviews Sign in Permalink In 2002, one movie proved what no one thought possible: Superhero movies were a genre almost untapped in potential and capable of generating millions of dollars world-wide. "Spider-Man" showed that costumed crime-fighters have a multi-generational influence and a mass appeal if kept under one condition: they are about the people behind the mask. What makes "Spider-Man" a film that transformed a genre and a whole decade (so far) is that at its heart it is a story about Peter Parker, a normal, geeky kid who comes across great power (that he learns comes with great responsibility). It is an origin story, not obsessed with the action and what the hero does as much as why he does it. Director Sam Raimi clearly connects with Peter Parker and knows exactly how to portray him. Tobey Maguire is an actor that gets at that. There is nothing hunky or masculine about him, yet he is beloved in the role, because through him the audience connects to Peter Parker more than Spider-Man. That connection being so strong then allows for everything Spider-Man does do to become more interesting, exciting and moving. You are with him and Raimi every step of the way. The very reason "with great power comes great responsibility" has become such a heavily quoted line is because when the script hits you with it, you're totally ready. After some great action and an interesting story with a compelling villain in the Green Goblin (Defoe) and strong character relationships, "Spider-Man" becomes a hit with its final scene. More important than the movie itself, however, is the way this film altered the course of Hollywood for the next decade, a decade that will be remembered that way forever.
10.0~Simply Brilliant! bill_carter_3 Sign in Permalink Well, I've now been to see Spider-Man twice, and it quite simply excellent. Being a long-term Spider-Man fan, I went to the cinema to see the film with both eager anticipation but at the same time some trepidation. I like most fans was worried about the organic web-shooters (webhead fans will understand). However, I needn't have worried. It worked very well. Do I have any criticisms of the film...of course. But, they are really quite minor. Tobey Maguire tends to mumble. Where did this fantastic Spider-Man costume come from...after Peter's pathetic attempt at costume making in the wrestling scenes, who made this amazing costume. Why doesn't anyone from the wrestling match remember Spider-Man once he becomes a superhero. Surely, the wrestling match organiser would remember (and he saw Peter's face - unmasked). Even though the CGI was obvious on some scenes, it wasn't in the vast majority of the Spider-Man sequences. The one thing I always like about the Spider-Man comics and cartoon, was Spider-Man's one-liners. I'd heard that these would, for the most part, be absent from the film. The film was so good that I didn't even notice. All in all, this was an excellent film and the best I've seen in a very long time (streaks ahead of Star Wars II - George should take lessons from Sam). I gave it a ten.
3.0~Worst kiss in movie history!! interunic Sign in Permalink All my friends like the movie, I do not! The story's as simple as dumb: There is Peter Parker transforming into a human spider, a bad guy wants to rule the world (after he also got transformed - into a crazy sucker) and our beloved Kirsten Dunst is so sweet and helpless, that Maquire (Parker) needs to rescue her. The jokes are as smart as the German music charts (I know this disease, cos' I am German) and the upwards kissing scene is the worst piece in movie love (how sick and slimy!). Good: Nice special effects (especially Maquire's computer- muscles... *he he*) * Bad: Everything else * Ugly: Willem Dafoe *** I guess, part two is better than this boring standard-hero-bad-guy-story. The poor fact is, that I like every further movie of Tobey Maguire more, than the first Spider part.
10.0~BEST Comic Book movie ever made!! Cellman Sign in Permalink First off, if you are one of those pathetic film students that is super critical of anything that comes out in a mainstream theatre you can just GO TO HELL!!! I get so sick of you guys being critical of movies like this. I can just imagine all the comments you guys are dreaming up in your little heads. <P> People are going to see this movie because they enjoy superheroes. I went to this movie expecting to be disappointed. The last few comic book movies were big disappointments, with maybe the exception being the first Superman movie. Spiderman is a movie that young and old can enjoy. As the movie grew to a close I found myself wishing that I could go see Spiderman 2 as soon possible. This movie was one of the most enjoyable movies I have seen this year. I might even go see it again.
9.0~The very first Spider man film and still the best one and one of the best comic movies and debuts of all time. davielee15 Sign in Permalink The first spider man movie ever hit the big screen in 2002 and is still a classic today. It's an amazing movie and is so original. The best of the Raimi series and the best spider man movie of all time. Tobey Maguire is excellent as both Peter Parker and Spider-Man and is convincing. Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin makes a menacing and entertaining villain. He is my favorite spider man movie villain. Kirsten Dunst is perfect as Mary Jane Watson. James Franco is also has a great supporting role as Peter's best friend and Norman Osborn's son. The love triangle between Peter/Mary Jane/Harry and the conflict between Peter, Harry and his father Nroman are very strong here and serve as the movies great conflict. The special effects are amazing in this movie. Cliff Robertson and J.K. Simmons also give great supporting roles in the film as well. The story is also fantastic. Overall, this is an amazing fun original debut for Spider-Man on the big screen and still stands as one of the greatest comic book movies of all time. People think that the sequel is even better but I strongly disagree with everybody who thinks that. This is still the best spider man movie to date. An excellent cast, great effects, gripping conflicts, and a great story. 9/10 Amazing!!
8.0~Shockingly Wonderful taintedvie Sign in Permalink I'm generally not one to bless the internet with movie reviews, but this one was simply too good to pass up. It makes absolutely no sense: the special effects failed to impress me, at points I felt that the story was moving too slow or too fast, the villain seemed more or less a modern rip-off of Jekyll and Hyde, the opening credits dragged a bit, and yet all the same I enjoyed every moment I spent in the theatre. There was something about the story that just made this movie untouchable, regardless of the blatant flaws. Was it Tobey Maguire's wonderful portrayal of a normal, naive guy who suddenly is blessed with something special? The Spider-Man experience as a whole? Or the intricately woven web of superhero action and a portrayal of a common boy in love with the girl next door... I don't know. It could be all three of those. At any rate, I recommend this movie to both young and old, Spider-man fans and those who haven't ever opened a comic book. It's a worthwhile several hours that will have the audience yearning for the sequel (I, personally, cannot wait), and exiting the theatre with a thoughtful outlook on how and why the events in the film unfolded as they did. 8/10
1.0~distasteful escapism onepotato2 Sign in Permalink I have a buddy who hates the back-stories in superhero movies, which he finds unsatisfying. True enough but that goes double for the conflict, the villain and the resolution of each new calamity, which are as predictable and shallow as video games. Within a year of watching people fall to their deaths from a collapsing World Trade Center, we're entertained by a movie which features Kirsten Dunst about to fall to her death from a damaged skyscraper. That's entertainment? No that's bad taste. You'd have to go back to Murder on the Orient Express and watch author Agatha Christie recycle the Lindbergh kidnapping to sell books after too short a passage of time, to see anything more cynical. Instead the correct means of channeling fear and unresolved feelings over 9/11 is to pester two kids who scared the dumber members of the culture with light-brights, featuring the Mooninintes. While the 30 percent of the culture that still supports Bush, call for their heads. Oh yeah, we're going to be just fine.
7.0~The Itsy Bitsy Spider Climbed Up The Water Spout! RaidonHyobanshi-1 Sign in Permalink I am a huge fan of Spiderman and I have been an avid reader for many years, so to see my favorite superhero of all time come on to the big screen for the first time was a huge and satisfying thrill. The film is a great comic book movie and perfect beginning for a series of spiderman movies in the future, the plot is an origin story and is always usually the hardest story to do. The story is of Peter Parker a nerdy high schooler, whom is bitten by a radioactive spider and his life changes in a way he couldn't have ever imagined. He acquires a muscular physique, ability to cling to surfaces and crawls over and up walls and shoot webs from his wrists. But the fun has only just begun as rich industrialist Norman Osborn administers a performance enhancing drug on himself and becomes the crazed psychotic The Green Goblin! now Peter has to become Spiderman and go at war with the Goblin whom has chaotic plans for new york and wants to ruin the spider. The acting of this film is above par and Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin steals the show and delivers a brilliant and manic performance, James Franco does an exceptional job portraying Harry Osborn showing a wide range of emotions, J.K. Simmons was perfectly casted as J. Jonah Jameson and delivers some hilarious one-liners, Cliff Robertson gives a heartwarming performance as the gentle Uncle Ben and Rosemary Harris is as sweet as ever as Aunt May. Tobey Maguire did a great job with the Peter Parker side of the character but I had a hard time believing him in the Spiderman role at times, and Kirsten Dunst was very dull and weak as Mary Jane and miscast in my opinion. The action sequences of this film are great but rather short, and some of the cgi is laughable but the film overcomes that. Compared to films like X-Men or Batman Begins this is a considerably lighthearted superhero film, but doesn't suffer for it and works better that way anyway. I will note however that a major downer on this film was the costume of the Green Goblin, now the costume in the comics wouldn't have worked either but this costume was like a bad power rangers costume and they definitely could have tried harder than that. Some great scenes were the Unity Fair attack scene, the burning building scene and the final fight between Spiderman and Green Goblin which was quite gritty and graphic. A great film and definitely worth seeing if you're a fan of this genre and I would recommend it to casual movie gowers as well.
10.0~Wow, can't wait for Spider-Man 2! cak91687 Sign in Permalink Let me just say wow! The movie was totally awesome! There were a few parts that the cartoon and movie were changed, but it made sense. Also, there were a few parts where predictable. But other than that, it was awesome! Great special effects, and really good! I'm glad they had some good laughs! All I have to say is, see this movie and can't wait for Spider-Man 2!
10.0~High Web Swinging Fun! SonicStuart Sign in Permalink SPIDER-MAN Starring: Tobey Maguire, Kristen Dunst and James Franco Genre: Action/Sci-Fi/Thriller Star Rating: ***** out of 5 PG-13 for Stylized Violence/Action This is one of my most favorite MARVEL Comic Book movies out of all of them! Spider-Man is one of my most favorite Marvel Superheroes because of all his web-slinging powers and plus his spider senses. This movie is pretty much the whole story of how the whole Spider-Man legacy started. A guy named Peter Parker (Maguire) is a school photographer and one time when going on a field trip he gets bitten by a new spider species and later he discovers it and gets all these fantastic super powers! Peter Parker then starts becoming Spider-Man and one of the first bad guys he stopped first was the guy who killed his uncle. Harry Osburn's father works for this one company and he later becomes the very first and memorable Spider-Man villain of all time, Green Goblin. The only one thing I thought that didn't seemed right was probably the Green Goblin's costume, it looked like nothing compared to the costume in the comics! The movie reminds me a whole lot of the 1994 Spider-Man cartoon that used to come on Fox Kids. The movie is just about how Spider-Man really started being a superhero really. BOTTOM LINE: BEST COMIC BOOK MOVIE EVER!
8.0~fine as fresh huckleberry jackrabbitslims-1 Sign in Permalink this movie zips right past your face and takes you on a pretty darn visual journey. althouh it does not really follow the comic book as well as it should it still left me smilin buds, it might be too late to catch it now in theatres but the DVD will prolly kick you out of your pants
10.0~With Great Power, Comes a Great Film. Tyler_R_Weston Sign in Permalink I must say that I was impressed watching Spider-Man. I saw it on the first day it came out, May 3, 2002. The plot was great, so was the cast, the effects, and the costumes! There are no flaws in this movie and I must give full credit to everyone who worked on it. Especially Sam Raimi who directed this movie brilliantly. I've got a gut feeling that Spider-Man II will be even better! Especially with Doc Ock. But too bad they took off the Lizard. He would've been awesome! Anyway, I'm glad with the rating that this movie got and Danny Elfman's score was beautiful. I hoped everyone else liked it!
10.0~Could not have possibly been better... AtlantaGayBoi Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi did an AWESOME job at translating the Spider-Man comic into a live-action blockbuster! The character portrayals were dead on (complete with the cheesy one-liners Spider-Man is known for delivering), and the costumes and action sequences were spectacular. As much as I loved Batman and Batman Returns, I must admit that Spider-Man has established itself as the best comic-based movie of all time!
7.0~Good Effects barberoux Sign in Permalink "Spiderman" was an enjoyable movie overall. I wasn't all that familiar with the character before seeing the movie but I think it did a good job at telling the story and introducing the character. Tobey Maguire was good as the lead but Willem Dafoe and Kirsten Dunst were somewhat wasted in their roles. Some of the effects seemed cartoonish and some of the violent scenes weren't cartoonish enough. The fight sequences, especially the punches to Spiderman's face, seemed too personal or intimate given the tone of the movie. There were these cold CGI sequences followed by a bloody punch to the mouth of Spiderman in slow motion. Was that really necessary? I think it ruined the tone of the movie. The Green Goblin was goofy. It did not seem real at all and that ridiculous mask hid the actor. Was that the point? Why have a famous name as the villain if he is hid by the costume. Save the expense by hiring an unknown and hiding him in a fancy costume. Kirsten Dunst was wasted except for the wet dress scene. Overall the cartoon tone and effects were enjoyable as escapist fare.
9.0~Best film adaptation of a comic book I've ever seen! drifkin Sign in Permalink An exhilarating joyride. Through great acting, direction, and a carefully crafted script, the film lures you into the central character's head so that you experience almost firsthand his amused discovery of his powers, his awkwardness and tentativeness at learning to control them, his rage toward the criminal who murders his uncle, the pain of every punch and blow he receives, his tentativeness at assuming the responsibilities of a superhero, and his ultimate joy as he transcends gravity, leaping and swinging above the streets of New York. And then there's the romance: Kirsten Dunst is just right as your Queens girl-next-door. She never comes off as a movie star, as anything less than genuine. Tobey Maguire's eyes and silences speak volumes as he gazes at and tries to speak to her. I've never been in a movie theater before where the audience cheered and clapped when the boy and girl kiss. How amazing that this film pulls this off, that action and romance enhance each other and never detract from the whole.
6.0~I wasn't very impressed... myturn21 Sign in Permalink I have to say that I was not at all moved by Spider-Man. For a concept that was over 20 yrs in the making & heavily anticipated by millions of fans, the final product is a vast disappointment. The producers do very little to enhance the classic story of Peter Parker & his transformation into Marvel Comic's most popular hero. I found the CGI to be substandard, most of the time our hero LOOKS like a rubbery computer-generated puppet akin to JarJar Binks. The battle sequences are uninspired & many elements are stolen from countless other FX-driven films. The Goblin's costume looks like a plastic horror, why not simply stick with the classic fabric version from the comic books? The acting is mostly average to dull with the exception of Tobey Maguire who does his best despite a mediocre script. The plot is choppy & frenetically paced with little explanation of the sequence of events. Calling this the best superhero film is an overstatement considering the better job done with X-Men two years ago.
8.0~Simple crafftey2 Sign in Permalink One of the best blends of flash, spectacle, and story done in a comic book transfer to film. It did help that the Web crawler had Sam Rami at the helm. Something that I hope future movies of this genre will adhere to -God bless this movie for not taking itself too seriously.
10.0~Wow alclewisc Sign in Permalink It was good because it was spider man Omg Wow Cool
10.0~The Best Comic Book Movie Ever Made rivermonk Sign in Permalink I have been waiting twenty-something years for Spider-man on the big screen, and I was NOT disappointed. Sam Raimi is awesome. No one does over-the-top cheese better than he. His style is aptly suited for comic book movies, and I like to think that no one could have done it better. The script was fantastic (it's refreshing to have something seemingly so faithful to its origins) and the players were perfect. I noticed a lot of groans during the romantic moments between Spidey and Mary Jane, but what people seemed to forget is that this movie was one giant comic book. That's the way comic book were/are written. Perfection.
10.0~I Saw It First gunga din Sign in Permalink YEAH, I went thinking hey, if this turns out like blade II, I will lose all faith in marvel movies. I have nothing against blade the hero, but the origan movie was so good, and then out of nowhere comes this bad movie. The pace of a movie is essential and that's what killed blade II. It was too fast to comprehend. Like a cheap magician who had to move quick so you wouldn't notice how cheap he was. Such was not the case with spiderman. It is slow enough to comprehend, and there's nothing to hide. It's all very well done. Acting was great, and although some romance scenes were to kids what corny acting is to adults, I think there's something for everybody in this film. Ok, so you want details? Big juicy inside stuff? Nah, sorry kids I don't believe in that kind of stuff. Besides if you were a real nerd first class you'd go out and buy ESSENTIAL SPIDERMAN volumes I-V and you'd not only know everything about this movie but its sequels as well. I look forward to seeing Doctor Octopus in the next film. Till then, I hope Peter Parker has enough web fluid to yank Star Wars Episode II Mucas Lukas Attacks down to size. Hmmm.... Seriously this is better than Superman (was there ever any doubt?). Soundtrack is not quite up there, but the movie is way over all our heads. How does this exist now, with so many bad movies?
8.0~A fun, flashy faithful adaptation of a great superhero comic. plummer-1 Sign in Permalink I've been waiting for this movie since 1977 when I saw the 'Superman' film. My patience (as if I had any choice in the matter) was mostly worth the wait. 'Spider-Man' was fun, colorful and faithful to a great (and MY favorite) superhero. When I heard that Tobey Maguire would play Peter Parker/Spiderman, I was skeptical. However, I think he did a pretty good job. My reaction to hearing that Kirsten Dunst would play Mary Jane was more optimistic, as in "Wow!" and "Hoo-ahh!" She was excellent. A good action film MUST have a great villian and Willem Dafoe made for a magnificently, maniacal and menacing Green Goblin. Was I somewhat distracted that when Green Goblin talked his mask's mouth didn't move? Yes. I also had a few other comic fanboy quibbles. For example: how long does it take for Spiderman's webbing to dissolve? In some scenes in the movie, you're led to believe it lasts for hours, while at other times webbing would dissolve seconds after Spiderman shot it. And what was with that scene at the cemetery? I saw 'Spider-Man' on its opening weekend in a jam-packed theater. When Peter told Mary Jane---the woman he says he's loved since they both were 6 years old---that he could only be her friend, some people in the audience actually booed and hissed! I don't blame them. That scene was lame. As for Mary Jane's delayed reaction of softly touching her hand to her mouth: Puh-leez! Did kissing Peter while he was STANDING next to her on a windy day feel the same as kissing Spiderman while he was HANGING upside-down on a rainy night? Those points aside, I really did enjoy 'Spider-Man', as did my wife and my 13-year-old daughter. [WARNING: this movie is NOT for little children. A few kids---about 4 to 6 years old---inside the aforementioned jam-packed theater started crying because they were so scared by the apartment fire scene and the final, bloody confrontation between the Green Goblin and Spiderman. The children's parents had to escort them out of the theater.] I waited 25 years for 'Spider-Man'. I'm so glad that I don't have to wait nearly that long for the sequel because I eagerly await it.
10.0~Comic books aren't my thing, but this movie is great! Can't wait for the next one!!! secretoktober Sign in Permalink The movie was just plain fun. Tobey Maguire was perfect as the shy science nerd turned superhero. The updating of the story was appropriate to the advancement of science that has taken place since Spiderman's original debut. The special effects were amazing, and there was actual chemistry between Maguire and Kirsten Dunst. The acting was terrific, and the writing was very good. There were lots of funny moments, and some very touching ones as well. I will definitely see this one again before it leaves the theater.
10.0~Outstanding bobdodge Sign in Permalink It delivers as expected and was completely worth the wait-25 years in my case. An enjoyment for Spidey fans, newcomers, and skeptics alike. The film had a couple variations from the comic history, but nothing to take away from the enjoyment of the story or characters. Special effects were on the money. Willem Defoe comes through big time as Norman Osborne about to lose his mind from his own genetic enhacement serum/gas. Maguire and Dunst have a great chemistry together as well. The only thing that takes getting used to for hardcore fans is the new look of Green Goblin, but after seeing the movie 3 times, it works for me. Bring on Spider-Man 2 and hurry!!!
10.0~THIS... IS... MY... CHILDHOOD! twbond-00867 Sign in Permalink In 2002, Spider-Man came swinging to life as one of the best movies Hollywood ever made. Easily one of the top 10 origins stories ever written, and Tobey Maguire dons the costume with pure-adrenaline excitement. The movie gradually builds his story arc, from him being an ordinary, shy teenager - to the webslinger that New York City knows him by. It then revolutionises the birth of his first ever nemesis: Norman Osborn a.k.a. The Green Goblin, played by the talented Willem Dafoe with a fantastic entrance a villain can ever provide. The love interest Mary Jane Watson, played by Kirsten Dunst, delivers a sensational relationship with the "vigilante", and James Franco plays his best friend, the son of the Goblin: Harry Osborn. The movie exceptionally shifts in tone, with personal losses with his Uncle Ben's death played by Cliff Robertson, and his relationship with his Aunt May, played by Rosemary Harris, all played in a mother/father figure. The movie definitely takes you on a "spin", and is congratulated by reviews: Rotten Tomatoes - 89% rating. It would be a crime to miss this movie, watch out for the city skyscraper's for Your Friendly Neighbourhood Spider-Man!
10.0~the best comic book movie ever, AND THEN SOME droogiedim77 Sign in Permalink simply amazing. an instant classic. fires on all cylinders. not only are all the leading roles brilliant, even the little roles are amazing. randy savage is awesome as bonesaw, bruce campbell rules as the announcer and j.k. simmons is picture perfect as j. jonah jameson. uncle ben and aunt may look like they walked right out of the comic book. and i love the lucy lawless cameo. tobey maguire is so convincing, he should change his name to peter parker. tobey and willem dafoe play their roles with just enough humor to not come off as cheesy and still maintain the tone of comic book. and sam raimi couldn't have been a better choice, seeing his innovative camera work in the evil dead movie his camerawork is breathtaking along with the cgi in the shots of spidey swinging through the city. if you havent seen this in the past week, go plunk down the $8.50 and see it again this weekend.
10.0~What I was hoping for and more. Aaron1375 Sign in Permalink Usually when there is a big summer movie I am looking forward to, I wait and wait and then the movie comes out and it is a big disappointment. I really looked forward to the American Godzilla movie and by golly it was a huge disappointment. Then I really looked forward to Star Wars episode 1 and although it was not the disappointment Godzilla was, it was still a disappointment. Spider-man however was everything I was hoping it to be. In fact, it has to be considered one of the best comic book adaptations ever. It actually took parts of the comic book and incorporated it into the movie. Unlike most comic book movies where the story doesn't come from any of the comic books. Sure there are some departures such as the organic web shooters, but this is acceptable seeing as how watching Peter Parker learning he has them makes for some humorous scenes. The entire cast did a great job capturing the characters they were playing and there are some great fights as well. This is also a departure from most comic book movies where there is really no good fight at all between the heroes and villains.
9.0~A character driven action, sci-fi film. k.y.l@talk21.com Sign in Permalink I love this film because the main character of this film isn't Spider-man but is really Peter Parker. It's thankfully the origin story which is considered one of the best comic story of all time. Even though having Peter a complete nerd isn't particularlly a favourite idea of mine, Raimi never lets this stray away too much that Peter has a scene where he gets bullied for five bucks. Even if the green goblins looks terrible without the glider Defoe pulls of Osborn beauitfully. There are a couple of lines such as "we'll meet again" by the goblin after he is beaten by Spidy in quite camp style which I didn't like and I swear sometimes when Spidy is swinging they reused the same footage. However you can't deny that this film has a solid script. My favourite scene would have to be the explanation of Uncle Bens death. A car jacking is a great explanation towards his death then anything ever explained in the comics. Such who remembers how one story stated that some criminal had left treasure in the Parker household. I just can't wait for Dvd I want to watch the scene where a goblin bomb goes of Spidys face in slo-mo.
8.0~Great Bored_Dragon Sign in Permalink I'm not Spider-man fan. To me, he is one of least interesting superheroes. But, if I ignore few really unnecessary pathetic monologues, this is one of the best superhero movies I saw so far. Have in mind that, with few exceptions, I watch them chronologically, so the statement refers to films made up to 2002. Within the genre I rate it nine, overall it's strong seven. 8/10
10.0~fantastic srameshpt Sign in Permalink I saw the movie recently and was very much impressed by it.It is truly he best adaptation of a comic book hero to he big screen.Sam raimi has done an excellent job.Tobey maguire is perfectly suited as spiderman and the chemistry between him & kirsten Dunst is good.The special effects are spectacular & intergrated well into the movie.The music is excellent.The only jarring note is the violence towards the end of the film.I can't wait for the sequel.
10.0~Not Your Average Comic Book Translation... VioletNurikoYume Sign in Permalink When first presented with the idea of going to see "Spider-man," I was more than a little leery. After the plague of Comic Book Heroes Turned Movie Heroes movies over the years, I was expecting nothing less than a depthless action movie flooded with the usual stream of implausible villains, hopelessly-doting females, and muscled heroes spewing out witty one-liners that only draw us more into the realms of the unreal. What I found myself faced with, however, was nothing less than one of the most excellent, engaging, and entertaining movies I've seen over the last few years. There are, naturally, certain aspects of "Spider-man" that may be seen as slightly unrealistic. For example, the movie is riddled with coincidences and events that make the viewer say, "Hm, well, it's a small world, isn't it?" Additionally, certain aspects of the plot are extremely predictable, not to mention that it's fairly obvious when the images of Spider-man are computer-generated. Yet, despite all this, and despite the fact that the outfit of the Green Goblin is vaguely comical, "Spider-man" is an amazing work of art, which appeases so many movie-going needs that it seems to fall into the stereotypical "something for everyone" category. Even being able to recognize the movie's flaws did not detract at all from thoroughly enjoying it, and I must say that I left the theater with the desire to go stalking through the streets in search of someone in need of rescuing. As for the wary parent, there is some minimal swearing, a moderate amount of violence, and death. There is also a scene where young Mary Jane's lack of frontal support is made obvious by an unfortunate rain storm, but aside from that and a great deal of muscle in spandex, there is no nudity, and certainly nothing even bordering on lewd. As someone else mentioned, young children may find that Green Goblin frightening, but most likely not so frightening that it would taint their movie-going experience.
1.0~awful idiotbx3 Sign in Permalink okay, i saw spiderman finally. hated it. so i told my cousin, a huge spiderman fanatic, that i thought it sucked, and he made me watch it again. accordin to him, i was "some kind of lunatic" fer not likin the movie. i watched it again, and i still hate it. i dont know why people loved this movie. seriously. toby mcguire is not my idea of spiderman, and kirsten dunst is an awful actress. i dunno why she gets much praise. and while i usally like william defoe, i hated him in this movie. actually, i hated the green goblin. lamest movie villian i've ever seen. i can't belive they're makin a sequel to this rubbish.
1.0~... oh please.... aaronjustice Sign in Permalink Why is this the most successful movie in history all of a sudden? There has never been much of a buzz about Spider-man before, why now of all times? Personally, I thought the movie was entertaining, but it wasn't that good. The comic bookish lines such as, "I'll get you next time Spider-man!" and such may have been in the original comic book, but should have been left out in the movie. Nowadays, insults like "F__ you Spider-man!" would have been used, but this is a PG-13 movie. I found myself chuckling at a lot of parts in this movie. Whenever something pops up in a movie I don't like, I always make fun of it. Let's just say I have never made so many comments about a movie in my life. Sure, Tobey macguire and Willem Dafoe were absolutely perfect for the parts, they were the only saving grace for this film as far as I'm concerned. However, having Spider-man computer generated almost the entire movie ticked me off. Couldn't they have hired a chinese acrobat or something? Whenever I see an action scene that is in CG, (ex. Final Fantasy), I never feel any suspense or even the least bit of turmoil because it is all controlled by a guy behind a computer. My biggest beef is that the green goblin guy works for a company that created an anti gravity one man vehicle, a strength serum, and little spheres that disentigrate people and shoot blades out and explode. Please, is Hollywood this dumb nowadays, can't they contribute to the plot a little and at least have him acquire these objects in another way? My rating, I give it an 8 for entertainment, but a 5 for the movie overall. Spiderman fans who blindly give this movie a 10 because they think they are obligated, get a life or a wife. One of them will change you.
9.0~Best Adaptation of a comic since Superman 1 Buddybaba Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi takes time amid the CGI to develop a story and will be rewarded with a new comic book superhero franchaise. Hope he continues to do the same with Spiderman 2. Purists might complain a bit but can't complain that Tobey Maquire is not perfect for the job. Willem Defoe is an amazingly schizophrenic Norman Osborne/ Green Goblin and hopefully J.K. Simmons will get more opportunities as Jameson of the Daily Bugle in the next installment. Great fun even though the price of tickets has jumped here to 9 bucks.
10.0~Best movie I've seen in a while. Grisanti74 Sign in Permalink I went to see Spider-Man on Sunday with a group of coworkers. We all agreed that it was the best day off of work we have all had in a long time. Me being a longtime fan of the comic book was especially impressed at the way they stayed loyal to most of the original story. Plus being that I know the comic book more than the people I went with, I recognized things that they didn't. Made my experience better. All in all this film is a must see. I personally give it two thumbs up and feel that it is worth the approximately $114 million that it brought in opening weekend.
10.0~Wow!!! That's all that can be said in one line. JediVenom1379 Sign in Permalink True "Web-heads" should be more than pleased with the film. There were very few changes in Spidey's back story, and everything fit into place in the end. I had my doubts about Tobey McGuire, but those were all laid to rest last night when I saw the movie. He played Spidey to a tee. The love scenes were a little underplayed, but other than that, Spidey's wit and humor were played beautifully. Willem Dafoe was stupendous. He gets an A+++ as one of Spider-man's biggest super-villains in my book. He played Norman Osborn and the Goblin perfectly. I left the theater in awe. This was very, very well done. I will most definitely be going to see it again, and it will be a must-ad to my DVD collection the second it gets released!!!
9.0~A ground-breaker... FugiSk8tr Sign in Permalink This movie was amazing. I went to the theater expecting another so-so comic book adaptation, and walked away dazed and happy to find a truly great movie. Many people have had the opportunity to massacre the character of Spider-Man, but Mr. Maguire really pulls the role off with sincerity and a down to earth quality rarely seen in the genre. Willem Dafoe was perfect, as was Kirsten Dunst. I never really got into the comic books, but I still had a great time with the movie! I recommend it to everyone currently breathing air.
9.0~Pretty Good Adaption From Comics Swampthing Sign in Permalink As a comic book fan for over twenty years, I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed the way the movie was adapted from the books. Fanboys might quibble about the organic webbing, or the fact that it was Gwen Stacy, not Mary Jane, who was around during the original Green Goblin storyline. Toby Maguire was a bit stiff at times, and I just can't buy into Kristen Dunst as Mary Jane. I really think they need another actress with more enthusiasm and light in her eyes. Aunt May was on spot, and Willem Dafoe handled his role as Osborn/Goblin quite well. The special effects were seamless, and I just loved the way the webbing looked! I'll look forward to this one on DVD as a must-buy!
6.0~A Pretty Good Film mcsheehey Sign in Permalink Don't get me wrong. I love Spiderman. I love the comic books, I love the TV show(s), and I like the plot they chose for the film. Still, this is not a masterpiece. it's a good movie that is revealed to be just a good movie when you compare it to its sequel. Sam Raimi and the actors obviously had fun with this film. The camp level is pretty high at parts, and the intensity never seems to be turned on. The CGI is easy to look at, but pales in comparison with either of the film's sequels. There are a lot of things to like about this movie. For instance, Tobey Maguire, Jmaes Franco, and Kirsten Dunst are all very good in their roles. In addition, the location shots are gorgeous, and the whole movie flows in a fun, relaxing manner. This is where we come to the film's major problems. 1. It's relaxing. The action never elevates to a level where you actually need to worry about any of the likable characters. The supposedly intense and scary scenes are not very scary or intense at all. Also, the film is too in love with its location to worry about anything else. 2. The green Goblin was a terrible villain. The costume was about as cheesy as it possibly could have been, and the voice-overs from the helmet seemed like something out of "Power Rangers." Wllem Dafoe is not to blame for this, of course. The scenes with Norman Osborne and no mask are expertly crafted. There simply aren't enough of them. 3. The film is boring at parts, and has low replay quality. If I had to watch it more than once in a day, I would probably fall asleep five minutes into it the second time. there's simply not enough action, and the romance isn't developed enough to make it interesting. Overall, "Spiderman" is a flawed film with a good heart. It's worth a rental, but perhaps not a buy.
6.0~Good kid flick dsb100 Sign in Permalink Don't go to this movie expecting a balanced mix of "adult" fun with "kid" action. The plot (while very authentic to the original) is thin and the motivations of the characters is child-like. The live-action fight scenes seemed clumsy and amaturish in comparison to the computer-generated parts. I was a big fan of the Spidey cartoons when I was a kid, but unfortunately this movie tended to feel too much like watching the same cheezy cartoons except with a sexy leading lady. (Compare it for example to X-Men, which didn't have the same cheezy feel but still was a great action flick for a broader age group). Tobey Maguire did great as a boy-next-door, but playing the action hero was a stretch and in my mind was not able to quite pull it off. The SNL skit was right on - you just wanted to fall asleep when he talked.
10.0~Sam Raimi at his best! crimsonmaskvideo Sign in Permalink Spiderman is a great movie that stays true to the comic. Sam Raimi has always been a brilliant director, starting with Evil Dead, Evil Dead II:Dead by Dawn & Evil Dead III:Army of Darkness. I wont go on about the movies plot since everyone on here has already. Just go see the movie. One of the beg points of the movie is that the greatest actor of all time, The king himself, Bruce Campbell, has a role as the ring announcer. The characters themselves are believable and well acted. I cant stand Kristin Dunst, but even she was very good. Toby McGuire played the nerdy guy perfect and was the perfect casting for Peter Parker. Bravo Sam Raimi. You are the dirtector of the fastest money grossing movie ever made. Im proud of you my Evil Dead friend. I will comment on the fools [especially the fool in the UK] who talk about the presence of American Patriotism in Spiderman. If you dont like it, too bad. Spiderman is a American made movie, Sam Raimi is an American, and he wanted to put in something patriotic. The end credits when Spiderman hangs from a flag pole with the american flag flying still sends shivers up my spine. Spiderman the movie is basedin New York, If you all recall the Twin Towers trailer that was later taken off TV. Spiderman even wears red, white & Blue. The movie itself is a symbol of America and what we are. So if you have a problem with the USA and great New Yorkers, then tough! Go see the film and quit being babbling.
10.0~I loved it! Jay-chan Sign in Permalink I loved the movie! It was the best! The effects were so good, I couldn't even tell when it was computer animated or not! Tobey was awesome in it! Great acting! ^_^ This is my favourite movie! I highly suggest you see it NOW!! ^_^
9.0~Best Comic Adaptation Since Batman Cyber256702000 Sign in Permalink Peter Parker gets bitten by a lab spider and gets the spider's powers. He uses his new web spinning powers to fight a new villain in town, The Green Goblin. This movie is hands down the best comic movie since Batman. Great special effects, Maguire plays an excellent Peter Parker, awesome story, and it is completely true to the comic book, unlike most of the other comic to movies. Very cool. ***1/2 out 0f ****
3.0~Gimme Dark Man Anyday sommerjd Sign in Permalink I still have fond memories of Sam Raimi's surprising "Dark Man" so I had some hope for "Spiderman." As Otto would say, "Disappointed!" Talk about slow-moving, but the worst aspect of this lugubrious effort is the villain. Besides looking incredibly cheap, Willem Dafoe's "Green Goblin" is simply uninterestingly unpleasant. Dafoe's a good actor, but let's face it, would you trust a guy that looks like him? He has to act to make himself likeable. Why any character would trust him in this movie is a mystery. So we have bad casting, bad costume, cheesy effects when G.G. is onscreen. The Spiderman CGI weren't special. The only saving grace is watching Tobey Maguire, who can act, and Kirsten Dunst, who can act and is lovely to look at. No need for sequels, please!
10.0~First great Marvel comic movie adaptation... and a lot more! Enrique Sign in Permalink Spider Man is the best ever Marvel comic movie adaptation - perhaps the best ever comic superhero adaptation. Tobey Maguire gives heart the movie to an incredible degree - hey, I am male and found him even "touching". What a great coup to have cast him as Peter Parker! Another big plus: the Green Goblin, except for his face mask, and, considering everything, not as bad as it could have been. He flew and threw his gadgets just like the comics character. J. Jonah James was magnificent, even if appearing all too briefly. And the general care taken to portray so many great little details of the comic shows a production made with love. I love George Lucas and the Star Wars saga, but "Spider Man" beats the new "Clones" movie hands down. It will never happen, of course, but, dare I say that Tobey Maguire deserves some Oscar best actor nomination mention? Please, Kevin Spacey (whom I like a lot) in "American Beauty" was not so good as Maguire in a challenging role.
6.0~nice, but only nice humpback Sign in Permalink Having had high expectations for this movie ( Having enjoyed the Spiderman comics without being a rabid fan ), I was rather let down by it - cries of HERESY !!!! start now . Two reasons for this - the general pacing ( it takes almost an hour before the Hero finally gets his act together and starts swinging in earnest ) and the high amount of screentime the "talks from the heart" scenes take - especially the long and tortured talks between Spiderman(-to-be ) and MJ. Some crisp editing here could have done wonders for the whole movie. Its not really necessary to plow over the same territory repeatedly - even the daftest drunk will get the point that MJs family is broken, her boyfriend Flash is a classic idiot etc, after the first exposition - and frankly, I guess, the audience was not in the theater for a suburban sociological exploration. Second, the longwinded (if perhaps necessary ) introduction, which IMHO could have been much more easily done with "flashbacks" - Its a long time before Peter Parker discovers his abilities, and even longer before he starts applying them creatively. Hmmmmpf - I expected more in this regard from Sam Raimi of all possible directors. The costumes, set designs and camera work are on par, but nothing to remember as novel, impressive or breathtaking (like say, the "bullet time" sequences in Matrix ). I can live with the cybered up, armoured Green Goblin and never had a moment of disbelief seeing Peter spiderclimb up walls or swing and bounce through the streets like "Tarzan-on-speed". On the up side, when the story takes off, the effects are brilliant, the acting by Macquire and especially William Dafoe is great to exceptional ( I only say "mirror sequence" - hats off to Mr Dafoe ), the small walk-ins from and references to the original graphic novel are well done, and there is a strange, wistful humour around. Unfortunately - only until the next overlong and sappy exposition scene ( I personally found the scenes with Aunt May especially tedious - strangely enough the women with us found the MJ scenes "stale"). Editing and pacekeeping are weak in this one, essential point. Sorry for repeating myself on this. Not bad, but could have been way better. 6 out of 10 goblins
7.0~Before superheroes became a cliché arenbilover Sign in Permalink Spider-Man works because of its focus on the vulnerable nature of human relationships and not necessarily its few but very emotionally intense action sequences. There is an attractive balance here and a plot not offering too much explosions and try-hard dialogue which in my opinion is way too common in this genre. The comedic parts feels spontaneous and not overstuffed like in many other similar movies. The casting is in my opinion perfect. Tobey Maguire really gives Peter Parker this honest tenderness and sensitivity which seemed very believable and frankly quite endearing at times. This is especially evident when sharing screentime with the lovely Kirsten Dunst. The chemistry between these two were really something! The webaction in this is the greatest I've seen in any movie about Spider-Man. The beautiful emotional dance of Peter Parker swinging through the city with the gravitional effects making it look like he actually has to make an effort jumping about is a treat to watch. It looks quite realistic to me. This was for some reason (?) not replicated in the two sequels where it instead looked visually unappealing in its CGIness in my opinion. The greatest superhero movie for me after Batman Begins. I unfortunately don't enjoy the critically acclaimed sequel Spider-Man 2 (2004) as much even though that one is pretty good as well. What Raimi really got right in the first two movies were the drama and the dialogue between the characters, the action to me was never the center of this movie despite its superhero title. So all in all, a great emotional drama with relatable, likeable and believable characters mixed with some spontaneous humoristic elements and some beautiful actionscenes which never felt tiring or overdone. A classic in my book.
6.0~Good At Times, Bad At Times! kirkster42 Sign in Permalink All in all, I enjoyed the motion picture version of Spiderman. It is good summer entertainment that is sure to dominate the box office (at least until Episode II, Men In Black II, Minority Report, Goldmember, etc. are released). Nonetheless, I have several complaints. First, the filmmakers relied too much on special efx for the fight sequences. Obviously, when Spiderman swings from skyscrapers special efx are completely necessary, and I have no problem with this. But the scenes of Spiderman kicking anus on bad guys should be filmed with martial arts experts. It would make them look much cooler in my opinion. Besides, it would not be hard to put a Jet Li type under the costume. In addition, maybe this is just me but I am sick of all action films trying to imitate The Matrix. If I see another slow motion, back bending hero dodge bullets (or whatever) I think I'm going to throw-up. Anyway, my second major complaint is the cheesiness of the dialogue. The scenes between Mary Jane & Peter Parker are so slow and drawn out that their often painful. Hint to the filmmakers: Don't force the sentimentality on the audience, it's not effective. Pearl Harbor proved this last summer. Also, the scene with the New Yorkers attacking the Green Goblin in defense of Spiderman is ridiculous. I'm guessing the filmmakers completely reworked that scene after September 11 to show their support for New York. Though it's a nice gesture, it is not needed in this film. After reading this review you probably think I hated the movie since most of my comments seem negative. While I certainly did not hate it, I would be lying if I said I was not disappointed with Spiderman. But I guess every comic book film can not be as good as the original Batman. Not much can. Rating: 6 - 10
7.0~Good But Not Record-Setting Good NRGWasp Sign in Permalink The movie is good, and I can't think of a kiss better than Tobey/Kirsten's, but it's far from deserving so many box office records. I doubt very much Spider-Man will be considered for awards that aren't visual effects or sound related. *I* certainly wouldn't consider it.
8.0~Childhood hero in the screen does well Tehmeh Sign in Permalink *just a little of spoilers, if any* When I saw this, I had to see it 3 times in a row. That's a lot. I was just so excited about this. Spider-man (as well as X-men) was such a character, I spent years reading the comics and loving it. I must say this was done well. Spider-man wasn't so dark as Batman or X-men, and it shouldn't be, it has always been more relaxed-kind of thing with him. Peter Parker, basically a low-esteemed kid, problems with his civilian life, crushes on girls....you name it. Casting is good. Tobey Maquire is the perfect "nerd" for the role, and he delivers it well. The humor was OK. Spider-mans humor, in the comics too, was really different from the other comics, and it was adapted to the movie pretty faithfully. Kirsten Dunst, well, M.J. was given a pretty different role here than in the comics, but hey, it works. J.Jonah Jameson - perfect! Aunt May - perfect! Green Goblin - perfect casting. There were taken some things that were changed from the comics, for example the web slings. Peter could sling web by himself in this movie, he did not need the wrist-machines. Which was OK, didn't bother. And well, the immersion of Spider-man flying around the city? Was done well. And I just loved the thing that Peter was still getting used to his new powers and not controlling them so much. Action scenes were good. Acrobatics, web slinging, camera rides - oh man. However, the Green goblin was a bit lame. It's just me, cause I don't like bad guys with ugly green costumes. That ain't the fault of the movie, just my own personal view about the several bad guys spider-man faced in the comics. Willem Dafoe was great though, I liked him. This movie was good, and did some building for the 2nd Spider-man movie. Sam Raimi really is a fan himself.
9.0~Amazing and Spectacular! curtk Sign in Permalink I've became a Spidey fan as a kid in the early '70's and stayed a fan through the mid '80's. Spidey has long been my favorite super-hero. Although I tried to not get my hopes up, with all the hype about this movie, I couldn't help it. It usually seems that getting my hopes up for a film only leaves me disappointed. Not so with this one! The movie was true enough to the original comic that I barely noticed the differences. And although there were differences, the changes did not appreciably affect the storyline. Spiderman is not only the best super-hero film I've ever seen, it is one of the best of any films I've seen in a long time! Of course, I'm kinda partial to the web-slinger, but the movie shows his humanity very well, which is one of the biggest attractions to Spidey. Spiderman has taken me back to my youth - I again found myself dreaming that I was the webhead! My only complaint is that it is too *short* at 2 hours - I could've watched another 4 hours easy! 'Nuff said!
10.0~Spidey! Maniac-9 Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi was the absolute best choice to direct the Spider-Man movies since it takes a person who's a hardcore fan of the series to have the passion to properly do the franchise justice. The actors were perfectly cast in their respective roles with Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson, Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt Mae & J.K. Simmons at J.J. Jameson. Even Randy Savage as Bonesaw McGraw and Bruce Campbell in his cameo as the ringside announcer was perfect. Very good choice to have the beginning of the movie be the entire first edition of the comic book.
9.0~Nine of Ten Stars jmhalm Sign in Permalink I have seen many reviews of this film that are very positive, and I agree with many of them. Ebert only gave the movie two and a half stars. I really don't know how he justified it - especially if he was a reader of the comic. His major problem seemed to be the special effects. However, the thing to remember is that this movie is a movie based on a comic book. The film should have that cartoon levity feel. All the actors brought their A-game. Tobey Maguire was the perfect Peter Parker. Though I originally thought Kirsten Dunst did not really fit as MJ, her pep and spunk fit very well. See this while this is in the theaters. 9/10 - A
1.0~So horrible, that its funny ! Steamliner Sign in Permalink This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and the only reason I'm reviewing it is because I have nothing better to do. Frankly, the acting was horrible, the character development was minimal, and the plot was completely distorted. The special effects, while flashy, did not make anything better unless you are attracted to flashing lights and noises (not literally). The ending was thin and unrealistic; and inexcusable goofs like Mary Jane's hair blowing towards the wind (instead of against?!) swinging on Spidey was so comical that the audience in the theater started to howl with laughter and hurl popcorn at the screen. This is not a film I would hardly recommend, unless you long for the good old days of food fights at the school cafeteria.
7.0~Too sentimental from a Spider-Man movie. cyber_tiger Sign in Permalink Spider-Man was a good movie, but there was too romance between Mary J. Watson and Peter Parker. The movie should have been more than the T.V series, just stories and action. Bottom line if there was not a lot romance between Mary J. Watson and Peter Parker/Spider Man, I'll give it 9 out of 10. But there was too much of romance (which killed the entire movie for me) so I gave it a 7 out of 10.
10.0~Acting ccantley Sign in Permalink Tobey Maguire was superb as the geek turned super-hero Peter Parker. Also Willem Dafoe turned an awe-inspiring as Osborn. Watch for the scene where he switches back and forth between the Green Goblin and Osborn... incredible!
7.0~super crucare Sign in Permalink this film is fantastic!!!i have never seen a so beautiful movie and i will return to see it a second time and much more;it seems like i have dream it in the books i read when i was young .i hope the movie will be out very early (perhaps at the end of this year;i love the maker of the movie
7.0~It's Worth It HunterGarza65 Sign in Permalink This movie will me an instant classic. The movie was great The movie should be bought Watch it I loved it,so so will you My Thoughts:Even though not as good as "The Amazing Spider-Man",this movie is really good and I give it a 7 but I can't go too high because of it's Plot and of course maybe even the way it looks.I think everyone in the family will enjoy this movie so watch it or rent it in Red-Box This movie is now available for sale and Rental
8.0~it's OK eragonfreakfan Sign in Permalink The spiderman movie was OK. They could of used a different villain besides the green goblin. May be they could of used someone else.And one thing in the original comics spiderman creates a fluid like a spider web he doesn't have it natural, he shoots webs from a wrist web thingy ma bob. I think that spiderman all in all was a pretty good movie for the first time around. But it seems in spiderman 1 and 2 that both villains get killed. At least leave one of them alive! But it's a movie so the heros always win and good always triumphs. They always make it in the last fight scenes where spideys mask is blown apart(thats kind of weird)But I like spiderman because it is action and you can relate to the charectars all in all spiderman is a decent superhero movie.
10.0~My spider sense is tingling! *Poss. Spoilers* Rattrap007 Sign in Permalink Words can't begin to describe how incredibly awesome this film is. Very faithful to the comic book origins. A few changes here and there, but it works well overall. I'm not an avid reader of the comics, but I have read the Spiderman novels so I know a bit about it. Originally Spidey/Peter dated Gwen Stacy and she died when Goblin threw her off the bridge. Also in the comics Pete makes web shooters and web fluid. Raimi made a good choice in making them organic in the film. The film is a very dramatic action film. It doesn't rely on constant action to fill time like some action films. It relys more on plot and well written dialouge than non stop action. The film as excellent as it is could have had just a tiny bit more to it. The novel had a few bits that weren't in the film but would have been great to see. For example: 1. Opens with a bunch of semi drunk guys tearing up a grave yard in a car at night. Spidey stops them and let's them flee in terror. He notices uncle ben's grave. He talks to and says the "Who am i?" speech to him. the movie is basically him telling his life story to his dead uncle as Spiderman. Ends with the same local. 2. After the open, it move to 4 year old Peter moving in with Uncle Ben & Aunt May. Ben explains to Peter his parents are gone. He crys up in his room. Also pete hates the plastic on all the furniture and Ben makes May take it off. Peter notices a spider in the corner of the ceiling and stares at it for hours. Ben comes up and gives peter a journal so he can write to his parents. He tells Peter that the spider is lucky. Peter goes to eat May's cookies but she get's rid of the spider (not knowing peter likes it) which sends little Peter into histerics. 3. The chasing after the bus goes on a lot longer in the book. 4. When he is Spiderman, he rushes to the Science dept. As Peter to get to his job. Dr. Curt Conners bumps into Peter and tells him he has to let him go. He fires Peter for being late all the time. The funny thing is Curt is carring a little iguana. After Curt leaves, Peter mutters a line about he hopes the lizard gets radioactive and bites him so Conners will know how hard it is for Peter to deal with the powers. 5. Uncle Ben is watching the wrestling on TV at home as Peter is facing Bonesaw. Overall I'd still give the film a 9.8/10. You will believe a man can web swing.
10.0~Web-Slinging Classic zurnderrick Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is at last brought to the big screen after several years of banishment. And I have got to say, that this is one of the best super-hero films I have ever seen. Everything that made the comic-books famous is in this film, and the character development is just excellent. It's too bad Ang Lee's Hulk wasn't like this. Spider-Man is pretty awesome, the stunts and effects done on the character make him look as if he is real, and was not made on a computer. The Green Goblin is also pretty cool, but his costume was a little off. I thought he should had has his trademark ghoul like costume instead of some strange green suit of armor. The movie also has great action scenes, great acting, and in the end, this film is incredible as the comic books are. Spider-Man 2 and 3 are also awesome, but it will always be the first that gives us that Spider-Man pep we need.
9.0~What can I say? (SPOILER) Point Dexter Sign in Permalink Being a comic fan myself, this film was a must see for me. The pre-release complaints levelled at the film did not distract me at all (and who gives a damn how Spiderman spins his webs?!?!), and I aimed to go in with noe preconcetpions. And I was stunned. This movie illustrates how a superhero film can be made without bogging itself down in special effects and action sequences. It gives us characters we can relate to, even the (I'll admit, not the best written) Green Goblin has a human side of him. Unlike X-Men which felt more like an introduction, Spiderman stands as a story in itself. There is more to come, yes. But we now have a strong handle on Spiderman's universe. there are some minor flaws though. the Americanisms were annoying but sparse, so I can't really complain. The Green Goblins suit still seems out of place to me, but it doesn't destory the film. Mary Jane's character seemed somewhat underdeveloped compared to the comic, but it was still wonderfully played out by Kirsten Dunst. And the Green Goblin's death- disapointing, but then again I know his career from the comics. Sam Raimi has done a great job of reflecting what Spiderman is truly about. Even the comics have wandered off the point sometimes. Spiderman is a hero who does not have the best of lives, but he works at it. I think the ending sums it up nicely- (SPOILER) Harry Osborne's feelings towards Spiderman are something Clark Kent nor Bruce Wayne never had to face. And that ending with Mary Jane- I nearly cried my eyes out...
8.0~Absolutely Raimi, really really good! Superunknovvn Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi has made some very good (The "Evil Dead"-Trilogy, "A Simple Plan" and "Darkman", which had a similar ending like Spiderman) and a few bad films ("The Quick And The Dead" and that romance with Kevin Costner) but one must say that Raimi's style is unique and simply cool. He was a perfect choice to do this movie, like Tim Burton was the only director who could do Batman justice. Hopefully, Raimi will become part of Hollywood's first league now. It's just so cool that he started with splatter movies and now knocks-out Star Wars! (see Peter Jackson, who made films like "Bad Taste" and "Braindead" and now the ultimate Blockbuster "Lord Of The Rings") Tobey McGuire and Kirsten Dunst were wonderful and William DaFoe proved once again that he can do everything from Jesus to the Green Goblin. Spiderman surely is an example for a well-done blockbuster and from my mind it's the best Marvel/DC movie done so far (with a new "Superman" -movie starring Brendan Fraser yet to come). How cool would that be if the Batman-story would be newly told and then the 3 superheros Super-, Bat- and Spiderman would get one movie together? Hm, well maybe I'm just one of those people who like the idea of "RoboCop vs. Terminator" and "Freddy vs. Jason" films.
7.0~"you want to know what I think? it's spidery.." leenux Sign in Permalink Okay.. lame title but after all the trailers and adverts surrounding this movie in the tv and cinema and newspaper, it's hard not to think about not watching it when it opens. Fortunately, this movie opens on Wednesday during Labour Day here so I have a chance to watch it early. I am a fan of Spiderman since the early years in print so I have a slightly higher expectation of this movie since it was announced. The main question is.. how well will Tobey Maguire represent the Peter Parker we all know from the comics? The answer is a yes and no. He has his moments in certain scenes but some scenes with Mary Jane or M.J. stumped me. Perhaps I didn't read his character well in this movie.. or they want to show his obsession with M.J. through facial expression - but I find his silent and grim smile slightly disturbing. Maybe that's just me.. The other actors did their parts well especially J.K. Simmons as JJJ. And Aunt May is bigger than I imagine her to be.. As for the overall feel of the movie, it's fun and heart stopping everytime he climbs the walls and swinging over skyscrapers. It is certainly a better watch in comparison with a certain other "insect movie" currently showing. The story follows well with the comics except for one thing.. how he got his web ability. It was artificial and scientifically created in the comics but in this movie, they made it a natural side effect of the spider bite. Oh well.. they can't fit everything into a 2 hours movie - look at LOTR but it's understandable. As a last note, the pace is okay and some 'look at my face to guess what I am supposed to be feeling' scenes could be omitted. All in all, a great and wholesome fun movie.
7.0~A Spider Can bcfremeau Sign in Permalink Not too bad for a throwaway summer flick. Tobey and Kirsten fan their romantic flames in classic fashion, delaying and denying their PG-13 attractions to each other as long as possible, even until the inevitable sequels. Dafoe is remarkably adept in his way-over-the-top out-for-blood-though-tortured villain. And the action-packed special effects are marvelously stunning, overcoming their cartoonish shortcomings (SpiderMan's jumps remind me of the Mario Brother's Nintendo games) by turning up the violence (when a madman drops a bomb, oh yes, innocents do die). But the real star is the script, expertly weaving campy dialogue with clever self-deprecating humor (SpiderMan's world wrestling debut was far and away the highlight of the film). It's always more refreshing when a summer movie knows its place and plays up the fun instead of pretending to be important.

7.0~my notes sstrunks-05245 Sign in Permalink Great movie. the original. good story. (about 6 viewings)
4.0~totally over-rated lomticks_of_toast Sign in Permalink Grade: 4/10 I've now seen this film approximately 30 times, and every time it comes on HBO I watch it, hoping I will like it more than during the previous viewing. Alas, that is not the case. This film can be viewed as 2 separate parts: Peter Parker and Spiderman. The Peter Parker portions (say that 3 times real fast) are far and away the superior portion of the film. I enjoyed Peter's interactions with Mary Jane - Maguire pulls off the shy, nerdy kid really well. However, his relationship with Norman Osborn (Dafoe) always felt rushed and silly. Osborn tells him at the end, "I've been like a father to you." Huh? When did that happen, exactly? They have perhaps 3 conversations throughout the film and they're very brief and businesslike. I can't really imagine their relationship growing off-screen, either. Another rush-job was Uncle Ben's death. Peter gets about 1 minute to see his uncle die. This could have been a very emotional moment in the film but I felt nothing, since their relationship wasn't explored enough, either. I guess it's excusable since the film was already very long, but Peter's relationship with Uncle Ben is what gives birth to Spiderman as we know him, so it should have been highlighted more. I should mention, however, that the champion of goof, Mr. Stan Lee, has his Spiderman "tag-line" appear far too often throughout the film, "With great power comes great responsibility." By the 3rd time I heard this I just groaned. How melodramatic. Then we come to the 2nd part of the film, the Spiderman portion. At first everything's great as Peter learns to use his new powers. Unfortunately, it quickly transforms into a goofy-looking cartoon. I can understand CGI when Spidey is swinging through the streets of NY, but why must we suffer it during street-fight scenes? Spidey hops and floats around like he's 4 feet tall and fighting on the moon (is he related to Yoda or Gollum?). No matter how good CGI gets (and it's NOT good, in my opinion, except with junk like spaceships), one thing the effects folks haven't figured out is realistic human dynamic movement and GRAVITY. Perhaps, however, Raimi wanted Spidey to look like he had jelly-legs with springs inside...but I believe a talented gymnast and some well-choreographed rope-work (see for example the Matrix, but not crud like Charlie's Angels or Romeo Must Die - terrible rope work) would've looked a lot better, say, when Spidey fights off the punks trying to mug Mary Jane in the alley. Last, we come to the Green Goblin, perhaps the corniest villain ever devised (second only to John Travolta's role as Terl in Battlefield Earth?). Everyone raves about Dafoe (and I personally enjoyed him in American Psycho), but he blows it here. Sad to say I liked Nicholson as the Joker better than Dafoe as the Goblin. The Goblin's dialogue is CHEESE, even to a five-year old. Dafoe is much more effective in his Norman Osborn role, when he's talking to himself/the Goblin. Also, his suit is ultra-goofy (designed for the military?!?! How about Cirque de Soleil?) and the fact that the mouth on his mask is fixed made me feel like the Goblin's dialogue was overdubbed (maybe it was). The overall effect is just plain silly. I'm looking forward to Spidey 2, but alas, it looks like the effects will be no better. Oh, well, there's always Spidey 3, 4, 5...
7.0~Great Movie - shame about the dialog. Matt-104 Sign in Permalink Visually well done. The story was typical for a comic book flick. The dialog, especially between Parker and the Love Interest, was at times melodramatic and overly drawn out. Good popcorn movie.
8.0~A true super hero movie shadowman123 Sign in Permalink I grew up on Spider-man and have probably been one of his biggest fans as a kid growing up and I was thrilled by the movie when it was reaslied on the big screen. I was just going through my DVD collection when I said to my-self just check it out. However I was actually surprised to see some comments which actually blasted this movie badly. Althouh I am a huge Spidey fan I understand that Hollywood is a big business which actually has money on its agenda first rather than pleasing the fans , and over time I have learnt to live with that and although it can't be denied although one or two things might of been changed in this movie , Sam Rami has sit down and down his research on this. The film is a thrilling ride from start to finish , moves at a great pace and keeps us entertained all the way through with its action sequences and emotional scenes. Tobey Maguire was cast brilliantly as the web slinger and although from time to time he maybe a little tooo geeky , it was all well. Willem Defoe was cast brilliantly as the Green Goblin and although The Goblin was never truly one of my favourites he seemed to make the regather interesting. James Franco and Kirsten Dunst who otherwise I can't stand were class. My only complaint about this was that they had changed The Goblins costume which I felt done the regather no justice but Willam Defoe managed to save that with his body language and use of the SFX. On the whole I throughly enjoyed checking Spiderman out as it reminded me of my childhood and as cheesy as it sounds to me it is still magical. SPIDERMAN 8.7 OUT OF 10 WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBLILTY...
10.0~Its a great film but...with something not so great... thejessman1000 Sign in Permalink Spider Man (2002) is a great film with lots of great affects and good action scenes.The film is good besides the acting.The acting is just plan bad.Kirsten Dunst is s good actress but she did not fit into this role and neither did Toby Maguires part he did not do so well either... The film is about a man named Peter Parker who is in love with a girl named Mary Jane Watson.When he was bit by a spider he got super human strangth and is known as Spider Man.Now he must keep his 2 lives seperate and try to keep them from colliding.He must fight his foes and protect the world!Besides the fact that the acting is bad Spider Man (2002) is a entertaining Action Pack thrill ride! 9/10 stars
9.0~Captures the essence well, even with a few changes stormwalker Sign in Permalink This is a really good movie, both as a movie itself and as an adaptation of the comic-book character I've long been a fan of. As with any such adaptation, there are, of course, some changes... the origin story is a bit simplified (but still retains its impact, in my opinion), and events are 'condensed' somewhat, but that's unavoidable when you try to adapt a comic book story that developed over several years into a movie-length plot. The simplification is well done, and it avoids the pitfalls of so many comic-book based movies that try to do too many things at once (witness the later Batman movies, which by splitting their attention between two villains and their plotlines manage to do none of them justice). Tobey Maguire is, as one of my friends put it, 'eerily perfect' in the title role, and on the whole the movie is cast very well. I have a few quibble here and there... it's not *perfect*... but it's very good. If you like Spider-Man, see this movie. If you don't know Spider-Man, see this movie, and you will. If you hate Spider-Man... well, you probably won't like the movie because it *is* Spider-Man and not only in name. This is not to say it's like a cartoon... it has a darker edge than what you'd expect to see on Saturday morning TV... but that's not out of line with the comic. Anyway... it's good. Go see it.
6.0~Although flawed, Spiderman engages and on the whole highly entertaining. Silverzero Sign in Permalink Its been a couple of months since I've seen Spider-man so its not fresh in my memory. However I can remember 90% of it so here goes. Despite the films minor flaws, on the whole it proves to be an enjoyable 2 hours. Heres a summary of my opinion of the film but don't worry. This is "SPOILER FREE". The costume for Spiderman was excellent and very well designed. It looked so clear I thought it was CGI. The Green Goblins costume was terrible and looked to clunky and metallic. Tobey Maguire does well as Spiderman although I still think Ben Affleck would have done a good job. Kirsten Dunst gives an imperceptible performance as Mary Jane. She goes un-noticed and her only asset is her hair that had been covered in lip-stick. Willem Dafoe, overall is OK as the Green Goblin, but anyone else could have done the part just as well. The films cinematography is excellent. The movie aims at more popularity than X-Men, Generation X etc., which proves successful. But enough of that, this is a spectacular movie the may not be as good as the 1989 Batman(in my opinion) but is still an excellent movie.
7.0~Surprisingly a good flick and this is coming from a girl who is a hopeless romantic lisafordeay Sign in Permalink I admit it I usually go for movies that are romantic or musical flicks like Grease or HSM but I actually liked Spiderman since I was a child as there was no Hannah Montana,Sabrina the Teenage witch which came out in 1996. The film version of Spiderman is about a young nerdy guy named Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire who is now replaced by Andrew Garfield in the rebooted version)who isn't the popular guy in school as guys give him a tough time as he is in love with a girl who is his next door neighbor Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst)who is quite popular in school. One day he goes to some school trip all about spiders and as he takes a photo of Mary Jane he gets bit by a spider and he becomes Spiderman a superhero who fights the bad guys in New York City as his uncle got killed by a robber(who is actually Flint Marco which you can see in the 3rd francise which is rubbish BTW that killed Ben aka Peter's uncle). Meanwhile Peter's best friend's father turns into Green Goblin by some syrup stuff and he is the villain in this movie. What I like about Spiderman is that it edgy,creative and although its a guys flick but girls who like a man that can kick butt might fancy him . The cast is good yet its too bad that they didn't give the role to Mary Jane Watson to Amy Adams or whoever as Kirsten Dunst was a bit of a bitch in this film she's always moaning and whining like a baby and she just annoys me,Tobey Maguire was OK as Peter but having said that he was great,the music is great as for everything else. I'll give it a 7/10
9.0~Beautiful fantasy samyaksambuddha Sign in Permalink Spider-man is one of the most famous superheroes and this movie does very well to maintain the image of the comic character. And the innocence of Toby Maguire and his beautiful chemistry with Kirsten is wins hearts. This movie has deeper dimensions as it expresses the philosophical dimensions of power- with great power comes great responsibility. This is a great work that shows that each one of us has a superhero within us, we just need to unlock it. The fight sequences with green goblin are interesting. Overall a great watch.
10.0~Spiderman was a perfect adaptation of the comic spacemanchris Sign in Permalink This movie is a perfect adaptation of the comic. I have been a Spiderman fan since I can remember, I collected his comic for years (I own over 300 issues), so I know Spiderman. Everyone one of his abilities was portrayed perfectly, his spidersense was beautifully rendered, the web swinging felt amazing and Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) was spot on. This movie is not dark and extremely accurate to real life, but that was why the comic was so wonderful. I am a computer animation major and a film minor, and I could only pick out the Computer Generated Spiderman some of the time, but you know what? Who cares, it looked great, the city looked great and the gren goblin was scary as hell. The story only strays from the comic in a couple of ways, no Gwen Stacey and his webshooters are built into him, but the choices made were good ones. The cinematography is creative and the transitions and montages were cleverly executed. Fans of spiderman won't be disappointed and neither will
6.0~Best of a Bad Lot Insyda Sign in Permalink Isn't it weird that DC Comics (well, Superman anyway) managed to spawn some decent movies while everything based on Marvel Comics is a dud? On the printed page, exactly the opposite is true. Spider Man towers over Superman, the Fantastic Four are fantastic  Unfortunately, on screen, Daredevil is terrible. None of the Hulk embodiments has been worth a carrot and the X-men films, though OK, for me miss the magic of the haunted heroes of the comics. The Spidey films are the best of a weak bunch, but I can't quite work out why they're not brilliant. Tobey Maguire is a great Spider Man, Kirsten Dunst makes a fabulous M-J and the scripts kind of nearly make it.
9.0~Exhilarating! dawn_treador Sign in Permalink The most exhilarating movie I've seen in a theater since "Raiders of the Lost Ark." What a wonderful movie experience. You won't have more fun than this. Please note, this is PG-13, and they mean it. The violence and bits of horror are quite intense, and the relationship between the two teenagers is portrayed accurately and sensuously. The movie is not appropriate for kids under 13.
10.0~GAME CHANGER kyleinnabi Sign in Permalink SPIDER-MAN DELIVER'S AN AMAZING ORIGIN STORY ... WITH A GREAT VILLIAN ... AND GREAT ACTING ... ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIE'S EVER !!!
10.0~The best superhero movie!!!!!!!!!!! webhead1731 Sign in Permalink This movie had everything, action, adventure, drama, comedy, it was sweet! Sure some parts of it were corny, but it isn't Spider-Man if it isn't corny, that's what I like about Spider-Man. The movie's plot was perfect, Green Goblin made a great villain, the special effects were amazing, and Tobey was a good Peter Parker. I think this movie was good for all ages, and perfect for all Spider-Man fans. Spider-Man's costume was a good updated version from the original, Green Goblin's costume was really good too. There were good action scenes with great music, Danny Elfman is good for Spider-man. See this movie and I'm sure you'll like it. I give this movie thumbs way up!
10.0~Go see it! taruss Sign in Permalink Well, after my two year wait for the release of this movie, I finally got my chance to see the final product. Although there was a bit of modernization of the original origin, that is consistent with the trend in comics. What was true was the plight of Peter Parker as a person upon whom herohood was unwittingly thrust. I would have cast MJ with a different actress, but Toby was Peter! The special effects were all that I expected and more. More than any previous attempt, I felt like an actual comic book saga had come to life. Kudos! The major awards will pass this one over, but for entertainment value, I highly recommend this movie.
9.0~Still one of the best comic book movies! funtasticfour Sign in Permalink 16 years later, and this movie is still awesome! Superman used to be my favourite hero, but these movies helped change that to Spiderman. An excellent cast, including perfect casting for JJJ, Peter, MJ and the Green Goblin. In fact, I practically fell in love with Kirsten Dundst from this movie. One of the only minor flaws was the costume for Green Goblin, but Willem Dafoe makes up for that by being ultra creepy. Also was not a fan of James Franco in this movie, but I guess he kind of hits what the role was asking of him.
10.0~An Amzing Movie with Great Special Effects Spooky2001 Sign in Permalink Wow!! This movie was amazing. This is one of my favorite movies and the best one this year. Good acting. Tobey Maguire was excelent as Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst was also excellent. She was as talented in this movie as she is good looking. I bet a lot of guys would like to be Spider-Man if Mary Jane was just like Kirsten Dunst, hot and amazing. If people think this movie was bad I think you need to get your head checked also if anybody says Kirsten Dunst is a bad actress and not good looking I would hate them a lot.
8.0~"Spider-Man" makes its first translation to the big screen with both style and substance... retroguy02 Sign in Permalink As a fan of the 1990s Spider-Man animated series, I was naturally eagerly awaiting the release of Spider-Man. Being directed by Sam Raimi (known for horror films) at a $100-million budget, and the lead characters being played by relatively unknowns, one may be skeptical, but Spider-Man proves again and again that one should not judge movies from the outside. Unlike some other superheroes, Spider-Man's origins are fairly rigid, and the movie takes an appropriately straightforward approach to it. The one thing that irked many fan-boys, Spidey producing webbing from his wrists rather than inventing it, wasn't a problem with me because it didn't change the character of Spidey at all, and besides, it does make more sense; Raimi himself put it best in an interview with something along the lines of "how can a high school student invent something in his spare time that scientists or government agencies haven't been able to?". The movie's main villain, the Green Goblin, is also introduced slightly differently than he was in the comics, but it's for the better, makes more sense, and isn't very radical. The movie's plot smartly plays it safe by limiting the scope to only one villain, one love interest, one tragedy (Uncle Ben's death), and a narrowed supporting cast. This allows for some deep character development and keeps the story cruising smoothly without any convolutions. Although superhero movies are rather prone to screwing up the climax, Spider-Man builds up very well all the way towards an appropriate and deserving climax. The action elements are also well-choreographed and surprisingly visceral for a superhero film of this scope; an overwhelming majority of the action sequences feature kung fu style, one-on-one combat action between the Green Goblin and Spider-Man. The scenes of Spidey web-swinging through New York are also beautifully shot in a way that lends an appropriate sense of 'speed' to them. The one element where Spider-Man takes most liberty from its source material is the costume design. Spidey's traditional red-and-blue costume, which doesn't show up until halfway through the movie, is enhanced with raised glossy webbing, reflective silvery-white eye lenses, raised spider logos, and a brick pattern on the fabric  this gives the costume a more realistic feel. However, it would have been better to show some glimpses of Peter making his Spidey costume, because it comes on screen out of nowhere and leaves behind a few untied knots; for example, those not familiar with the comics may argue that "whoever made the costume would know the identity of Spider-Man", and the costume looks pro enough to be misleading. While Spidey's costume is slightly altered for the better, the Green Goblin's suit is overhauled completely, and looks very high-tech and robotic compared to the comics' organic design. But what struck me most is that the Goblin's mask is stationary, so nearly all the emoting is left to body language. Where facial expression is needed from the Goblin, the eye lenses are lifted and Norman's eyes convey the emotions. At least the mask should have been non-stationary, because I was quite irked by how hard it was for the Goblin to emote. Although most of the cast gives an impressive performance, Tobey Maguire easily takes the top spot; he perfectly fits the nerdy teenager's role with his youthful looks and voice, his body is supple enough to be Spidey's, and his soulful eyes are able to convey emotions with little effort  in fact, Maguire does for Spidey what Christopher Reeve did for Superman. Willem Dafoe was sometimes a little over-the-top moody as Norman, but otherwise gave a fine performance. Kirsten Dunst's expressions also seemed either overdone or flat, never in that 'sweet spot' in the middle (unlike Tobey), while James Franco was stiff throughout. J.K. Simmons' stints as the brash Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson were solid hilarity and without doubt the best minor role in the movie, while Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson also shine in their roles. "Spider-Man" does have its shortcomings and takes some liberty from its source in some places, but all the changes except the Goblin's redesign work in its favor. Despite that, some great combat action and character development, Danny Elfman's epic soundtrack and a lead actor that couldn't possibly have been better make "Spider-Man" a thoroughly impressive superhero film. RATING: 8/10.
10.0~Must-see ledorky Sign in Permalink This is a great film. Sam Raimi and the rest of the cast has done a wonderful job in the comic book adaptation. There is far more than action in this film. Sure, the explosion scenes are great but it's even more wonderful to see some character development. I won't bore you with the usual plot summary of an awkward teenage boy given super-powers and his struggles with fame. This is faithful enough to please the die-hard nerdy comic book fans young and old yet will give enough of a story for those with no previous knowledge. It has enough twists and turns that even the comic book fans will enjoy seeing how the "new" story unfolds. This is comic book at its finest. I can't recommend it enough.
7.0~Way better than Batman tastyhotdogs Sign in Permalink "Spiderman" was one of my favourite cartoons as a kid. Spidey was just the perfect combination- he could climb walls,he was strong,could fly with his webs and shoot webs from his hands. I used to think how cool that would be. So you knew when this got adapted to a movie with humans in it, I'd be one of the first ones in line (if a stack of nerds didn't beat me to it) The movie starts with Peter Parker (Maguire) on a school trip checking out an animal lab. Pretty soon he gets bitten by a mutant spider, causing a nasty bite and pretty soon some big side effects eg super strength and being able to shoot webs from his wrists. While this weird stuff is going on, Peter is still trying to woo Mary-Jane (Dunst), his cute next door neighbour. Peter soon becomes fascinated with his newfound skills and decides to enter a fighting comp. He wins, but decides he should dedicate his skills to helping people, not living large. When the Green Goblin (DaFoe) comes onto the scene, it's clear we have a good old good vs evil battle brewing. There's lots of twists, love triangles, relationship struggles and more that make this more than just a boring old comic adaption. Way better than the original Batman and it's predecessors. Worth seeing.
10.0~GREAT!!! sleepyskater Sign in Permalink Excellent movie! I love it! Well, not only that my favorite actor starred in the movie, but also the great lines, great view, I just can't say everything that I think about it. You know, every time I watch it, I found something interesting, cute, funny, scary etc in in.. Not every movie does it for me! Tobey Maguire was just perfect for the role of Spiderman and Peter! *Trust me* LOL True!! =))))
1.0~A Web of Clichés Stawrogin62 Sign in Permalink What's this movie all about? It's a daydream of omnipotence by a boy in his puberty strongly suffering from an inferiority complex. Unfortunately this daydream is a very dull one. There's no originality or some sense of humor in it. But in compensation of these deficiencies it is a very wet daydream. Once our boy gets to know, that he can ejaculate (anatomically incorrect) out of his wrist, he will never stop to do this. As for the rest of the movie: Stereotypical characters uttering platitudes. And besides ... the computer-animated Spiderman often lacks the right proportion while he's swinging his way through town leaving you with an unpleasant feeling of wrongness. Yes, the movie is close to the comic - its Peter Parker is nearly as whiny in his pose of the reluctant hero as his drawn fellow. One out of ten!
10.0~Spider-Man, Spider-Man, does whatever a spider can... Bremaster1967 Sign in Permalink The absolute BEST comic book adaptation of ALL time! Better than the X-Men, even better than Superman (1)! You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll wish you could be bit by a genetically engineered spider. You'll be swinging through the streets of Manhattan and climbing walls. Absolutely amazing!
1.0~Awful story... hyann3444 Sign in Permalink This movie was horrible... there was no story to it! The special effects vary in quality from scene to scene. Overall, I was completely bored with this effort. Why are so many people going to see this garbage? Further proof of the dumbing down factor in America.
10.0~That's right, true believers... Jordan-M Sign in Permalink I was totally blown away by Spider-Man. In fact, it made the horrors of waiting in line for two hours seem not so bad after all! I wasn't expecting much, seeing as other supposedly promising superhero films had let me down (Spawn, Batman Returns-Forever-And Robin) in the past. Thankfully, the good people at Sony put Sam Raimi at the helm. The movie is very well-crafted. From high school drama to love story to tragedy to action movie and back, this movie covers pretty much all bases, and with a finesse rarely seen these days in huge-franchise movies. The computer animation can at times be a little hokey, I know, but at least it looks better than some guy in a suit crawling across a floor designed like a wall with the camera tilted to make it look like he's going up a building! At any rate, if you're one of the five people yet to see Spider-Man, by all means DO! That's not peer-pressure. Not at all. See it. Love it. Go. Now.
7.0~Entertaining, but not Fantastic... Pscribe Sign in Permalink This film is one of the better comic book turned into a feature film It ranks up near Batman (1989). There are flaws and points that are annoying and unbearable. Positives: 1. Danny Elfman's score should win him an Oscar. 2. Tobey Maguire further cements himself as an above average young actor. 3. The digital animation is, for the most part, unnoticeable. 4. Kirsten Dunst plays her role well. Negatives: 1. The costume design is atrocious. No emotion is played out in action scenes. 2. James Franco just can't act. 3. The script does not account for the feelings of wierdness during the transformation into a spider-like creature. (The script in general is below average.)
1.0~Over-rated big time tampaman24 Sign in Permalink Give me a break. Top 200 movie of all time? Not even close. The bad guy in the movie was one of the worst characters I've ever seen. It just was not a very good flick. It tried to build up the love between Peter Parker and the girl and then all of a sudden, he just can't be with her? Please. This movie will become a cult movie and will get good rating because people will be afraid to speak the truth, which was, this movie wasn't very good. However, I feel that the sequel might be better because they don't have to build up the character so much.
6.0~Web-Shooters? Where were they? The Goblin Sucked! Sparty627 Sign in Permalink Was it just me or did anyone else notice that his webbing came out of his wrist instead of the web-shooters that all of the cartoons and comics use. I can't stand when they change the story like that. Any Spidey fan knows that he uses web-shooters. AND the green goblin sucked!!!! He looked like an underdeveloped cyborg!!!!! They should of used the kingpin or something. They need to bring the marvel characters together for a big film. A movie with spidey, hulk, and the x-men would be cool! Your Opinion? Sigh
2.0~Major Disappointment johnpcosgrove Sign in Permalink What a disaster. Fakey looking CGI effects, inane dialogue and long stretches of solid boredom. Were they trying at all to be original? Apparently not--better to recycle every cliche Batman and Superman have run into the ground.
9.0~The former #1 of all time deserves more credit dberryii Sign in Permalink The fact that this film hovers around a 7 is a shame. I can understand how some may feel the movie hasn't aged well, but there was a reason no movie could even come close to hitting the numbers Spider-Man did for 7 years. 7 years is unheard of nowadays! Sam Raimi's Spider-Man is the reason the MCU, DCEU, and all the other franchises and standalone seven exist. Spider-Man started it all, and it started with a bang.
8.0~Easily my favorite of the year... when I saw it. BravesPaul Sign in Permalink Despite the hype, I actually expected the movie to be good -- not great, not bad, just good. I expected the acrobatics to be cheesy and annoying, and (most of all) I expected the villain to be so cheesy that I wouldn't believe in his threat. The "Green Goblin" just didn't appeal to me in the trailers. I compared the villain to Montgomery Burns (The Simpsons) in my head on several occasions before seeing the movie, just for the childish, it-could-never-happen feeling he gave me. However, after actually watching the movie, all of that subsided. Tobey was great, Kirsten was great, Willem was great. Given that Spider-Man is a fantasy/action flick, Raim and friends actually made a darn good movie -- easily my favorite of the year (was there ever any doubt?) at the time... At least until Star Wars was released. Now I'm faced with the problem of deciding whether I liked Episode II for Episode II, or because I love the idea of the entire Star Wars universe so much. Either way, Spider-Man is much better as a standalone film, and hopefully it has kicked off a healthy string of successful Spider-Man films in the future.
2.0~Woefully wet web-slinging kinseyp Sign in Permalink After all the hype I was amazed at how poor this movie was. I don't know why, but I couldn't bring myself to care about anyone in the movie and so i didn't get involved in the plot lines. The special effects were awesome, but to an extent I think I've come to expect that and I think the days when a movie can survive just on it's special effects are over. I can't say I'm a great comic book fan, but the Batman movies struck me as superior to this one. Some of the problems - Peter Parker suffers a number of horrific losses in the film, but his reactions are so downplayed and wooden - its hard to believe he really gives a damn. MJ was OK but seems so shallow, dating an obnoxious ass presumably because he has a hot car - hard to find much sympathy for her. I think the last straw was (possible spoiler) when Peter's best friend decides that he hates spiderman and is going to seek revenge. The oh-so-obvious set up for a sequel is an insult to the intelligence of the moviegoer. Overall I just wasn't impressed and after all the hype I felt really let down.
10.0~Best SuperHero movie MacGyver0099 Sign in Permalink This movie had everything: action, romance, and suspense. It followed the legend of Spiderman quite well, while adding a few original features of its own. For those who didn't understand Willem Dafoe's dual character as the Green Goblin, he played it very much like the one in the comic book and cartoons. This was the best superhero movie I've ever seen.
6.0~Decent movie jbt136 Sign in Permalink This movie is in every way an average movie. The only thing done well is the casting of Tobey Macquire as Spiderman. He is excellent for the role and acts decently. The special effects are also decent. The one major flaw is the prolonged sappy scenes of Spiderman with MJ or his aunt and uncle. The movie would have been much better off without those sequences. The movie is overall very creative and fun.
10.0~(sniff) I think I'm gonna cry. amishguy Sign in Permalink You know it's been a long hard trip for movies based on comic books. From Popeye to X-men there has just always been something missing. That something has got to be Sam Rami. While watching Evil Dead for the first time a few years back I would laugh a little and sit in awe of the unique talents of the man responsible, but no one else seem to get it. Well now with Spiderman everyone can see the genius of this modern day master as I have. He held nothing back in capturing everything that the Spiderman is about. The slight cheesiness was perfect and let you know that this is the world of Marvel and not some dark reality. This is a place to escape to not from. He captured what Burtin did with Batman. Movies don't always have to be realistic. It is a fantasy. On top of everything he put everyone he knows in this movie. I know that for years to come this genra will be full of crap like the up and coming Daredevil movie with Ben (not an action star) Aflec as the lead and Michae Clark Duncan as Kingpin (?), but there will always be Spiderman.
9.0~One of the best movies of 2002... blteigen Sign in Permalink Warning: Spoilers This will probably be one of the best movies of 2002, perhaps the best all summer, with that Minority Report and Austin Powers movie as rivals. Spiderman is one of the best comic book-adapted films since The Crow. It certainly beats X-Men and Batman and Robin. The acting is superb and the storyline is easy to follow. Tobey Maguire was a good casting choice as the masked hero who protects NYC from thugs and criminals. Kirsten Dunst was not at all annoying like she was in Bring It On and made her character as MJ very believable. But the best part of the movie, in my opinion, had to be Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. I've heard that people complained that his costume sucks (so what) and that he is not evil enough. Are these people kidding? Goblin was a very disturbing character, in and out of his costume, especially when he starts accusing MJ of being only interested in his son's wealth and in one moment delivers Aunt May fruit cake out of costume and then in the next attacks as she's saying her prayers. But then sometimes it is easy to sympathize with him, especially when he dies and he doesn't want his son to know what he really is. The only true villain is one where you cannot help feeling even the tiniest bit sorry for them, but these kind of characters just don't happen in cinema any more. All in all, Spiderman is an excellent film. You have to see it at least twice in the theater. I give it a 9 out of 10.
7.0~Just a bit more than a run-of-the-mill superhero flick; but does it deserve all those votes? alanpuzey Sign in Permalink In the end, it's just another superhero versus supervillan movie. Yes, the angst of Peter Parker is an interesting addition - both in the original comic strips and in the movie, but the second half of the film is so formulaic that this overpowers the better points. Having said that, unlike other reviewers, I thought the effects were very good and at a large screen cinema, Spiderman swinging through New York streets nearly gave me vertigo, they were so good. The Green Goblin character was pretty banal and the amorous scenes between Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson were some of the hammiest I've seen. The music accompanying these scenes was also 'so predictable'. Casting on the whole was good with Tobey Maguire quite perfect in his role as Spiderman/Peter Parker. It is such a shame that a potentially good film was let down by such a weak script and - towards the end - such unoriginal treatment during which the characters become more and more cartoon-like. Sadly, as I write this I see that Spiderman is already in the top 250 films around the 120 mark - a reflection that even IMDB's excellent chart is open to the most recent and over-hyped films achieving far higher positions than they truly deserve. Had Spiderman been released ten years ago I am sure far fewer people would have voted for it and would give it far lower ratings. It is sad that these inclinations cannot be compensated for, even with IMDB's vote weighting. Director Sam Raimi made a 10/10 movie a few years back, 'A Simple Plan', based on an excellent novel, it doesn't figure on the charts as it was an undersold, under hyped movie, yet here is Sam storming up the charts with a film based on a shoddy script that in my opinion rates 4/10. One final point, I watch my favourite movies (some highly rated in the IMDB charts - such as 'The Usual Suspects', 'Godfather' & 'Shawshank Redemption' - to quote a few) many times over, and I certainly would not consider watching Spiderman again, though I'm perfectly happy to have seen it the once.
9.0~The best comic book adaptation...probably Spider-Dan Sign in Permalink Ah yes...the old superhero movies, we've seen the good, Superman, Batman and then have come the bad, the respective sequels to these movies with the exception of Batman Returns, but none hold any love from me like The Amazing Spider-man does. Maybe it's the fact he's your regular Joe till he gets bit, the fact that unlike the previous two hero's his origin doesn't seem unidentifiable (yes, ok he's bitten by at radioactive/GM spider which none of us will be, without dying). It was these points that made him the greatest superhero ever created (thank you Mr Lee) and none finally he has the film to do his greatest justice. Before I saw this film I had heard many complaints about it, the effects don't look upto scratch, he should have mechanical webshooters etc,etc but my excitement and loyalty remained undeterred and I was dually repaid Raimi and co. did a fantastic job. Firstly, Tobey Maguire, who of which I can't imagine anyone else in his place, was absolutely fantastic in this role he brought the warmth, awkwardness and charm needed to carry the role of Parker/Spider-man off and clearly enjoyed himself. Whoever said he couldn't do it because he has no 'star appeal' were wrong and those who suggested the walking irritation that is Freddie Prinze Jr for the role need shooting. His love interest MJ the gorgeous Kirsten Dunst did very well in her role with what little material she was given to deal with outside her position of screaming victim, she is a great talent and should have been used more. But the two that really caught their roles inch perfectly were J.K. Simmons as the hilarious J.Jonah Jameson and Willem Dafoe as the very menacing (despite the awkward costume) Green Goblin who made his role increasingly creepy as the film went on and shining in the mirror scene. I also want to take a moment to thank David Koepp for providing a near flawless script, something ususally missing from the event movie and give the film something different. The man though, who deserves all the credit must be the one, the only Mr Sam Raimi for providing us with this. He judged everything perfectly, the fight scenes where brutal over glamorous, the scenes with Spider-man swinging through the streets of New York, breathtaking, as he looked like a man that was barely in control yet knowing his every move to precision, as he fell only to fling himself back up again. Every cinematographic moment was typically Raimi as the camera couldn't contain itself twisting, turning, struggling to follow Spidey's every movement. With the odd shot aside the effects, for me, were upto scratch. The love affair between Peter Parker and Mary Jane was well comtained and the final scene between the two was a heartfelt, beautiful scene and a credit to all those involved. Raimi did the right thing fighting for Maguire (as I heard) and it paid off, this just didn't end up being a movie about a superhero it finished being a movie about a boy struggling to come to terms with his power, his destiny, his curse and in my eyes surpassed the other super hero films and becoming a franchise I actually might not end up hating. and another thing if they must bring The Lizard in for the sequel give it to Bruce Campbell the guy deserves it.
1.0~You call this a film?! aryaelvenlady Sign in Permalink I saw the trailer of this movie and was expecting a very interesting and action-filled masterpiece. I begged my mom to let me see it in the movie theaters. But I never saw it in the theaters. But my grandma and grandpa had bought it on DVD, so when I was at their house one day, I decided to watch it, thinking I'd love it. Now I am saying this for every person who still has even an ounce of sanity left. THAT WAS BY FAR THE STUPIDEST MOST BORING MOVIE I HAD EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!!!!!!! What a waste of my time! The acting was OK, but some of it was bogus! The special effects was just plain fake!! There was no action in it, or at least not enough for me! I was COMPLETELY disappointed!! I hated the fact that Uncle Ben died. I didn't think that was necessary! As the time passed on I started getting bored. I kept glancing at the clock, and started reading books, and almost fell asleep. When it was over, I hurried up and turned the DVD player off and turned nickelodeon on. I kept telling myself how silly of me to think that it would be, like Spy Kids, interesting and fun and action-packed. I actually thought that! Boy, was I wrong! Those of you who still have some sanity left, take my advice and don't waste your money to buy the DVD. My dad bought the DVD 'cause he liked it, but I didn't like the idea of owning the movie. My brother liked it(although he was only 3 at the time)and then he kept on annoying me with his obsessiveness with the movie. Good thing we lost the stupid movie! But the sequel looks a lot better!! I just hope I don't get bored again! If you like this movie, I recommend Harry Potter1 & 2(1:6/10;2:7/10), Spy Kids1, 2 &3(1:10+/10;2:10++/10;3:10+++/10) and 13 Going On 30(9/10). Over all, this is my rating for the movie: -100/10
10.0~WOW!! redgemini27 Sign in Permalink I must say I was a bit hesitant to see that movie at first due to all the hype, but was very glad I did. I thought the special effects were great and Tobey Maguire was an excellent choice as a nerd turned a super hero (so to speak).
10.0~Can't get any better charlesacree Sign in Permalink Spiderman can't get any better. Of all the comic book heros to make it to the big screen, this movie is as well done as one can be. Action, romance, special effects, it has it all. But what really makes the movie work is that all the major parts are cast perfectly. From Tony to Kirsten to Willem, everyone simply was the part they were playing. A must see!
7.0~Good but not great Sinestroplex Sign in Permalink Whether you've read the comics or watched the TV show, spider-man has been everyones favorite wise guy superhero. His powers unique, the villains wondrous, and the whole concept of an average guy saving the world are what built this superhero's legacy. When I heard they were making a Spiderman movie I was just as excited as anyone. However, while I enjoyed the movie, I couldn't stop thinking to myself "Was that really worth it". Sure the movie portrayed his beginning well, but something seemed wrong with it. Then I realized it, Tobey Maguire just doesn't make a good spider-man. As Peter Parker, Tobey demonstrates the "science genius" and the whole "self-constrained-never-on-time-for-anything" thing accurately, he just lacks acting capabilities to portray a superhero with such a huge reputation. Actors like Willem Dafoe and Cliff Robertson were needed to keep this movie from flopping. Willem Dafoe was the perfect choice for Spiderman's arch enemy the Green Goblin and couldn't have played the part better. Cliff Robertson was excellent as Ben Parker and even though he was only in it for a short part of the movie, he really allowed audiences to feel apart of the movie and not just watching acting. I'm not saying Spiderman was a bad movie because I liked it overall, but I am saying that it was rushed and it did not live up to the true potential it had.
10.0~I WISH THIS MOVIE CAN BEAT TITANIC fab-one Sign in Permalink I am expecting this movie to beat Titanic in ticket sales. I am starting a campaign. I have watched the movie 5 times (in theaters, not in video, so that's 5 dollars -- our ticket here is around 50 pesos or equivalent to a dollar -- more for this movie), and I am planning to watch it more. Wanna help me make this fantastic movie the top grosser of all time?
7.0~good stuff mondrian Sign in Permalink This is a good movie -- don't let anyone tell you it isn't. But it's not great -- don't let anyone tell you it is. The green goblin is too ridiculous for even a superhero movie, some of the effects look like claymation, the actions scenes carry no real suspense, and Spidey doesn't get any much-needed Kirsten Dunst tail at the end. Gah!
8.0~The most amazing superhero-debut in cinema history! EijnarAmadeus Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is probably the most amazing superhero-debut ever made. Tim Burton's Batman was entertaining, slick and had a great comic book look, and Richard Donner's good-ol' Superman was a uniformed and catchy, but none of them has got Spider-Man's depth and power. Everything from Tobey Maguire's geekish charm to Williem Dafoe's evil-minded bad-guy is perfect, and although the movie is pure entertainment, it is as good as it gets. Sam Raimi took the responsibility of making the movie about one of the most beloved superhero-characters of them all, and after watching this you realize that he couldn't have succeeded more. Combining great action with witty romance, comic book textures with thoughtful characters this is simply put a great movie! Peter Parker is a nerdy but very behaved boy who lives with his uncle and aunt. He always gets picked on at school, doubling the problem is the fact that he is in love with his neighbor and class-mate, Mary Jane. One day everything changes, Peter gets bitten by a spider and becomes very ill, but only for a few hours. The next morning Peter discovers that he's built up an extraordinary physical condition and that he has taken the spider's powers, easily climbing walls and spinning webs. Developing this talent Peter draws his new persona, Spider-Man. But that doesn't make life easier, 'cause with great power comes great responsibility.
10.0~Two Thumbs Up! abadox12 Sign in Permalink Before watching the spiderman movie i had my doubts, I'm a fan of the Spiderman comic book and cartoon, but the film delivered! :) And it's not about some super hero who has mega powers trying to save the world from a ultra villain, it's just your average guy who's in love with the girl next door who happens to aquire supernatural powers and uses them to help his city to become a better place. You have action when you need it, romance when time comes, comedy moments and drama all in the same package!
10.0~One of the best movies ever made! ksmo313 Sign in Permalink "Spider-man" was AWESOME, The cast was awesome, and the special effects were awesome! There is no movie with better special effects! I've never read any of the comic books, nor watch the cartoon but I loved this movie! This is definitely worth seeing, and should be seen on the big screen. I give this movie a 10/10!
7.0~Very good movie, so-so writing m-fan Sign in Permalink Spider-man is a very entertaining movie. The special effect were great. Also, the major characters and acting for them was very good. Their are a few points that would have made it an even better film. The story plot was good, but the writing was only so-so. My guess is it was written by many part-time or temporary writers, using the recently more often used Hollywood pass-the-script add-or-change-a-little-more writing method that is to blame. Most of the secondary characters and some scenes were very two dimentional. For example when Peter caught his lady love AND all of the things she dropped, none of the students even noticed. None of the students made any big deal of him doing a somersault from a stand-still and then punch a quy twice his size clear across the room (except: "Wow", or "Freak"). Also, when Osbone is given his walking papers at the board meeting, the whole scene and all ot the people there seemed artificially two dimensional and emotionless. Only other comment is that Spider-man's girlfriend could have been dressed a bit more modestly. Anyway, overall a very good, and fun movie. If the writing for spiderman II improves it will be an even bigger hit.
10.0~Excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat action-packed ride! Catherine_Grace_Zeh Sign in Permalink Wow! What an excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat action-packed ride! That is the main thing that I can say about SPIDER-MAN. Anytime Spider-Man/Peter (Tobey Maguire) was being tormented, I felt sorry for him. This was because I could relate to how he was feeling. After he got his superpowers, I was really awed. It's hard for me to tell you specifically why. When he and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) kissed, I got all warm and tingly inside. Now, in conclusion, I recommend this excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat action-packed ride that you'll want to see over and over again to all Tobey Maguire or Kirsten Dunst fans who haven't seen it. When you see this movie, hold on tight and prepare to be taken on a fast and wild ride. I guarantee you you'll be taken on a fast and wild ride.
10.0~Coming from a longtime Spidey-fan, this film rocked!! jude bomba Sign in Permalink I have never before been so hyped to see a movie, being a longtime spidey-fan, and this movie delivered on all accounts. All the main actors played their parts perfectly, particularly Dafoe and Maguire. Dafoe delivered the best comic-villain performance since Jack Nicholson as the Joker, and personally i think that his Goblin surpassed Nicholson's joker. Still Maguire wasnt overshadowed, playing the perfect high-school nerd-turned hero. Also Kirsten Dunst was great as the object of parker's affections and J.K. Simmons was hilarious as J. Jonah Jameson. Particular credit should be given to Raimi who handled the project pefrectly. I enjoyed the way the movie still had that "Raimi" feel even though he was working with a budget that hes never been able to touch before. I think that the final battle scene had a particularly Raimi quality to it. Also bless him for putting Bruce "the man the myth the legend" Campbell in a cameo role, adding Campbell will always make any movie better. To sum up, coming from a Spidey-fan this movie rocked and I gave it a ten, ive seen it twice so far and im probably going to see it again...if you dont see it youre missing out badly...
1.0~too much hype! msharri Sign in Permalink i'm a long-time comic fan, and always try to catch movie adaptations of these comics. spider-man was no exception, and i saw it when it was still in theaters. it didn't live up to the hype surrounding it. i wasn't impressed at all. not only did it not stick to the spirit of the books, but it's plot didn't intrigue me in the least. even if i didn't possess any knowledge of the spider-man mythos to compare the movie to, i would've still regretted seeing this film. it's a garish flick that attempts to overwhelm its viewers with spectacle, as opposed to drawing them in with the strength of the story alone. i was absolutely baffled when i saw this flick on the imdb's top 250 movies list! not only is this not one of the worst movies made, it's not even a good comic book adaptation! if you're in search of a comic-based film, i suggest that you check out the original batman and crow movies.
6.0~This film is clearly trying to boost New Yorkers after 9/11. *spoilers* ichabod81 Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is not a very good movie. I expected much more. It's written by David Koepp, who has made some brilliant work in his career (Jurassic Park, Stir of Echoes, Panic Room), but although the dramatic tones in the story are good and the movie moves along nicely, it's the over-acting by Dafoe, that at times makes me gringe in my seat. When he's Osborne, it's done with style, but when he becomes The Green Goblin, that's when we start to go way over board. Sadly, Raimi's direction is not also all it could be. Plus, it irritates me how this film is forcefully trying to restore confidence in New Yorkers (and I guess in Americans in general), by the bridge scene, for example. When you hear someone scream "You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us!", it really sounds overly melodramatic. And Poor. Just like Harrison Ford in Air Force One. The bad communists have attacked on America, but don't worry, our fair president will kick the living s**t out of them. USA! USA! Well, "when in Rome.." i guess. I must hand it to Raimi, that it was a masterstroke to cast Maguire in the role of Parker. He's the most promising new talent to hit Hollywood. Knowing that, it makes me sick to think that such coverboy as Freddie Prince Jr. was actually considered at one time. Oh well, in the end, Spider-man is good for viewing or two. It has it's few moments, but mostly it's standard stuff. J.K. Simmons steals the show. *** / *****
9.0~Everything I excpected...and then A LOT more krispykreme14 Sign in Permalink Let me start by saying that X-Men, another Marvel comic switched into a movie, would lose terribly in a fight with Spider-Man. I was alarmed when I saw that Tobey Maguire was cast as Peter Parker, but I thought he was perfect for the role. On the other hand, when I saw Willem Dafoe cast as Norman Osborn, I was anxiously awaiting his performance, but I felt that he was extremely fake when donning the armor of the Green Goblin ***Spoiler, sort of***(although he was good in the schizophrenia scenes). The characters were well developed and the acting was of a better caliber than what I expected. This was an extremely fun movie and well worth the PACKED theater (not to mention the annoying people who clapped practically every time when Spidey said something).
10.0~The *best* superhero movie....*ever!* Sneakers Sign in Permalink I remember when this movie was first announce 10 years ago, and being a Spidy fan, I was eager to see it....and at times, wasn't sure if it would come out. Well, I just saw it, and man oh man di it ever blow me away! I just loved it, and is a definate must to see and get on DVD. Now a days, it's hard to get wowed by a movie, cause you seen this, saw that....mostly everything has been seen or done. Matrix was awsome, cause it gave us something new, and the last movies that wowed me was Harry Potter, and Lord of the Rings. Now, Spidy was just a great movie, and the Goblin was a cool villian. Basicly we see how Peter Parker deals with the new found powers, but also deal with everyday problems, and the guilt that has fallen upon him. When X-Men topped Batman for superhero movies, setting the bar of what to expect...Spidy did the same to that movie. We have a new champ folks.
7.0~Good adaptation of the comic book. lingmeister Sign in Permalink This movie had a lot of fun and laughs in the beginning when Peter Parker, being the adolescent nerd tries to fit in with the rest of the kids in school. Along with the discovery of his power and the not so direct path in learning how to use it, physically and mentally. Including some immature attempt to make some money in order to buy a car so he could please Mary Jane. The Development of the characters, including Peter Parker, from an innocent kid to this superhero was very well done. As for the Green Goblin, he was portrayed well as this troubled scientist who had an alter-ego. Too bad his costume masked his whole face, since pretty much all of his devious characterizations were portrayed through a mask that didn't animate. We did get to see a little of the eyes later on though when he keep the mirrored googles in its opened position. Jamson's character was the most colorful, it is as he is lifted straight out of the comic book. The swinging sequences were quite unique, giving us a perspective from spidey himself. The only scenery that has a grand portrayal is on the Queensborough Bridge. I guess this movie didn't really aim for that. Much of the scenes seemed way too dark, where it looks like it was filmed in a dark place, with dim lighting so the central action is not high lighted. And if that was not enough, most were fast paced action. What one ends up seeing is a whole bunch of dark blotches and blurs, making us have to guess what those scenes were about. A scene I found too sappy is the one where Spider Man takes Mary Jane for a ride down the city via his spider webs. Seems to be straight out of Superman during Loise Lane's first flight with superman. To sum it up, an enjoyable superhero movie.
4.0~Derivative Super Heroics F. Poole Sign in Permalink Before I start citing better super-hero movies (there are several), I would just like to say that while I found this film to be highly derivative of its counterparts (as well as of other genres), I must say that I was totally impressed that the entire audience applauded when the picture ended. Of course, this was an afternoon matinee on a Saturday so seven tenths of the audience was under the age of ten which means that most people there were not old enough to remember how good Batman was (let alone Superman). On only his third attempt to sell out, and even following a Kevin Costner vehicle, Sam Raimi has finally hit his crowd pleaser. Hell, if Ron Howard can go from Grinch to Oscar in just two pictures then just about anything you can imagine should be possible. I'm going to keep this simple. I didn't hate this movie. At times I found myself enjoying it, thinking that things could be much worse. In fact, for all of its shortcomings (which follow) I must confess that the filmmakers did a fine job of establishing a mood and aesthetic for this super-hero movie that is all-together much brighter than most other super-hero movies. But after the picture let out, I couldn't think of one thing that I really liked about the film. So what's wrong? A lot of the acting was bad though. Raimi's charm as a character director seemed absent save for Bruce Campbell's wrestling emcee. To any Raimi fan, this would come as no surprise. Dunst, who was brilliant in Jordan's Interview with the Vampire, was flat and managed to salvage nothing of an already terrible (and empty-headed) female character, Mary Jane. (Rachel True's Mary Jane was superior in the 1998's pot comedy, Half-Baked.) Tobey McGuire, and Willem Defoe are capable of much, much more. I shouldn't need to cite references here. Semi-newcomer James Franco's performance was probably the least disappointing of the lot, though his character was likely the weakest. (WARNING *** SOME MINOR SPOILING AHEAD ****) Several narrative elements seem to be drawing on and owing their success to other better movies with similar ideas. For example, Peter Parkers metamorphosis process may remind some viewers of David Cronenberg's most commercial picture, The Fly. In another sequence, Franco comes home to the sound of his father screaming upstairs in their cavernous home; a moment reminiscent of Kubrick's film, The Shining, when Wendy hears Jack screaming in the main hall. (NO MORE SPOILING) Then there's Elfman's score. Boy howdy! It was probably the most derivative element of the entire film! It sounded pretty much like EVERY OTHER Danny Elfman score, except for the ones where he rips off John Williams, like Good Will Hunting. Lastly, there was simply too much CG. Hollywood action movies seem to have degraded to an intellectual level that sinks beneath 3-D light shows and firework ceremonies. The cynics will feel that this has always been true...but I contend that the richness of characters, performance, and story lines in Superman and Batman will forever be far superior to the CG smoke and mirrors that make attractions like Spider-man earn $41 million dollars on their respective opening weekends. Enough said on Spider-man. Decide for yourselves...and before you take issue with my point of view on this piece, watch Superman.
10.0~Spider-Man spins web of excitement, action, and humor. JerichoBSB Sign in Permalink After 40 years of ups and downs in the comic book world, the Amazing Spider-Man finally hit the big screen, and it packs a major punch. Being as though I've been an avid Spider-Man fan for the better part of my life, I may be a little biased, but not only was this a great super hero movie, it was a great movie PERIOD. The film stays true to the comics (mostly, at least), yet still provides non-comic fans a great flick. Unlike most superhero films, Spider-Man makes you care about the characters involved, sympathize with Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), and feel every single twist and turn in this roller coaster ride of excitement. The superhero movie genre has a new star. Look up in the sky... it's not a bird, not a plane, and DEFINITELY not a bat. It's a spider, my friends. A spider.
10.0~An Honest Review generationofswine Sign in Permalink It is clearly a Sam Raimi film. You see that right away in the sense of humor. Make it cheesy and cheap enough and the audience will laugh at it sort of humor...and it works. You laugh when you see the cheap jokes, the low-budget moments in a high budget film, it all adds to the appeal, it makes it fun to watch. Plus, Peter Parker is the Dork we all know him to be. He's the nerd, the dweeb, and the smart alack that has to keep cracking jokes so he doesn't have to face the life and death reality of what he's actually doing. Tobey Maguire excels at bringing Peter Parker to the big screen in a way that stays true to the character and the source material. He is far better than the travesty of Andrew Garfield's Spider Bully. You get the sense with Maguire that Spider Man is a hero and not Garfield's excuse to mock and bully people while pretending to be a good guy. Maguire is a great fit for Raimi's vision of Spider Man and between the two of them the film delivers as much in action as it does in comedy. Sit back and enjoy it, no matter how old you are it's worth the ride.
7.0~An entertaining movie. yendesk Sign in Permalink I am no fan of big FX summer blockbusters, and only saw the recent Star Wars movie due to my continuing affection for the original trilogy. I was quite surprised, therefore, that I enjoyed this film. It had everything that Attack of the Clones lacked - likeable, believable characters, a decent script and some fast-paced plotting. I don't know whether the sequel will be as good, as my favourite part of this film was when Peter Parker was coming to terms with his powers. A fully formed superhero is far less interesting. However, for once, I was not left thinking "How can people watch/make/take part in this drivel?"
8.0~Spider Man is Super on Screen view_and_review Sign in Permalink Spider Man, the genesis of the now comic book superhero trilogy. It's a trilogy now, but it is supposed to become the Harry Potter or Police Academy of comic book movies. The first one is the best more often than not, and that holds true for Spider Man as well. It was so fresh, so new and Peter Parker was young and carefree, making Spider Man a much more endearing character. Spider Man was super hyped, and for the most part it delivered. If it did not deliver, it would not have been the first nor the last overly hyped movie to bomb. Fortunately, Spider Man was an excellent movie from both a story standpoint and a cinematic standpoint. Spider Man and X-Men are the blueprints for the correct way to convert a comic book to a movie.
10.0~Simply awesome (: petril Sign in Permalink Went to see this movie at Finnkino's Plevna theatrecentre, at firstnight show, with 2 friends, and we all were amazed by this motion picture. Acting was good, esp. Tobey Maguire(Parker) and Kirsten Dunst(M.J) did their roles as passionate as possible! Recommended for everyone!
10.0~Spidey as he's meant to be onscreen. Chris-332 Sign in Permalink Not since 1989's Batman has there been such a brilliant, fun, and hyperactive comic-book adaptation. Evil Dead and Darkman helmer Sam Raimi has gone back to his roots to deliver an over-the-top and energetic extravaganza that hits all the right levels of campiness and seriousness. There have been many comic-book movies in the past few years, but all of them have had a fatal flaw to keep it from true greatness. Batman Returns (a sequel I feel is better than the original) can really only be enjoyed by Tim Burton fans. Blade, although it was extremely entertaining, was FAR too over-the-top and cheesy to be anything more than a popcorn and eye-candy movie. X-Men, still one of the most ambitious comic-book movies to be brought to screen, had the flaw of taking itself TOO seriously, therefore the campy sequences felt strange and unmatched with the rest of the film. Batman + Robin, well, let's just not go there. Spider-Man gets it all right. Tobey Maguire's brilliant performance of Peter Parker, as well as the death of Uncle Ben, perfectly parallel the hyper kinetic and exxagerated style of filming (a trait from Raimi's earlier films) and the cheese wiz performance by Willem Dafoe, who seems to be having even MORE fun with his performance than in Shadow of the Vampire. Aside from the comic-book justice, Raimi also will please fans of the cult classic Evil Dead and Darkman films. Taking a step away from his more drama-driven career turn, he returns to his unique style of filmmaking, where almost EVERY shot of film is moving fiercely or spinning around violently. The fact that the CGI is a bit cartoony fits his wacky vision very nicely. After 13 years, the long-awaited Spider-Man matches the group of classic comic-films along with Burton's Batman and Richard Donner's Superman and shows us the way comic-book movies SHOULD be.
10.0~A true hero cjase22007 Sign in Permalink What can I say about Spider-Man? It's an amazing movie. Everything is excellent from the production, writing and acting. Hats off to everyone and Sam Raimi for steering it in the right direction. Spider-man spawned two sequels and a reboot; with another reboot currently in theaters. Well, Andrew Garfield was great, but I will remain a fan of this original trilogy. 10*
10.0~Absolute Best Movie of the Year!!! dragonbeauty23 Sign in Permalink I recommend this movie to all! It has been a long time since a movie of this caliber has come out! It was funny, it was awe inspiring, and packed with "edge of your seat" action!!! What's not to love about this once in a lifetime movie? The love story did not infect the entire plot and the action was not too graphic. I would say that this movie was perfectly balanced and superbly executed! Spider-man and his superfluous moves are a must see. So, what are you waiting for? Go and enjoy the movie NOW! It's the one thing you won't regret doing this year I guarantee!
9.0~The New Superhero Movie Gold Standard Scarlet-22 Sign in Permalink A while back, I wrote a review of 1989's BATMAN, where I called it "The Gold Standard of Superhero Movies". I now have a new Gold Standard. SPIDER-MAN, last of the big name superheroes to get his own movie, had an 18-year struggle to reach the big screen. Accordingly, this movie had almost impossible expectations to live up to--yet amazingly, the film not only lives up to them but surpasses them all. Tobey Maguire is dead-on perfect as Peter Parker, and we watch his transformation from geek to freak to superhero with wonder and joy and heartbreak. Sam Raimi fought Sony tooth-and-nail for Maguire as his first choice, and like Tim Burton fighting for Michael Keaton 13 years ago, we the viewer in viewing the final result now understand the director's loyalty. Maguire's performance is subtle yet commanding. He takes hold of Peter and immerses himself thoroughly into the role. It would have been a huge mistake to cast Spider-Man and retrofit him into the Peter Parker role; by casting Peter Parker and having him grow into Spider-Man, the complexities of Stan Lee's groundbreaking hero shine through Maguire's magnificently expressive blue eyes. Right up there with him is Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborne, ambitious Dr. Jeckyl-esque scientist driven mad by his lust for power in the Defense contracting industry and truly driven mad by his performance enhancement chemicals, which bring out the Mr. Hyde within him. At no point do you detect that Dafoe is in danger of going over the top with this performance; in fact, just the opposite occurs. Dafoe is so tightly controlled with his performance that we hang on the edges of our seats waiting for him to snap, and snap he does. His conversation with the mirror in his study is perfectly done, a snapshot of the entire range of complexity and subtlety and rage and fear in his performance. Kirsten Dunst is beautiful and talented as MJ, but one wishes some of the scenes showing her own growth and transformation from abused teen to trophy girlfriend to independent thinker that were in earlier cuts had been kept. But Dunst makes up for it with her spunk and zest, and that upside down kiss with Spidey in the rain may be the hottest thing ever put on screen. The rest of the cast is first-rate--Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben, the catalyst for Peter's life work; Rosemary Harris as doting Aunt May; James Franco as Harry Osborne, whose strained relationship with his father forms one of the many complex triangles in this film; J.K. Simmons stealing every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, who'll make Spiderman famous (or infamous). Raimi's direction is fast-paced and furious, and borrows extensively from much of his earlier work (the entire Peter-designs-his-costume sequence came almost straight from DARKMAN, a much underappreciated film), and manages a strange balancing act: We know we're watching a comic book come to life, but never once do we forget that the comic book that has come to life is one of Marvel's most groundbreaking and complex works, with characters who are real and lives that are full of anguish and pain. One scene in particular crystalizes the movie's power: As the Parker and Osborne families gather in Peter and Harry's Manhattan loft to celebrate Thanksgiving, everyone there--Peter, Harry, Norman, Aunt May, and MJ--has an agenda. Everyone's agenda is hidden at the beginning of the meal. But by its end, in onion-skin layers peeling away to reveal raw, acidic, damaging underlayers, everyone's agenda is exposed, and no one is what they seemed when the scene started. The exposition in this one scene drives the entire last half-hour of the film. The film isn't perfect--there are moments when the pace drags a bit; the inevitable "join me" confrontation between villain Green Goblin and Spider-Man is not up to what it could be; some scenes cut from the film's final version really needed to be there and will hopefully be there on DVD--but it blows away every other comic book film I've ever seen. Go see it.
7.0~"With great power comes great responsibility" Cameronius_113 Sign in Permalink Spider-Man was released in 2002 and was directed by Sam Raimi. The film is about a high school kid named Peter Parker whose life changes completely when he is bitten by a radioactive spider and gains superpowers, going on to develop the alter-ego of Spider-Man. What makes this movie stand out from other superhero movies is how much attention to human detail it is given; we're presented with relatable every-day characters which we begin to care for because of how much we identify with them and it becomes a story you can understand and doesn't seem out-of-this-world like many other superhero films. The director also understands how to balance the amount of time given to both the human side and the superhero sides of the characters. Tobey Maguire is perfect as Spider-Man and even though I think Tom Holland will do a great job in the new Spider-Man: Homecoming, Tobey is the true Spider-Man in my eyes. He captures the character of Peter Parker perfectly; awkward and quirky but a character you can identify with and relate to and therefore care for. His traits combined with Maguire's performance make him a very likable character and a great lead. The relationship between Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter Parker was handled in a realistic, albeit very entertaining manner and there are multiple situations that many can relate to as they can put themselves in the positions of both of those characters and feel what they are feeling which makes their relationship one that audiences can connect with. Willem Dafoe portrays the main antagonist of Norman Osborn/the Green Goblin. I loved his performance as Osborn and he was a fascinating, complex character, however I couldn't really buy the Green Goblin too well. I understand that the film is supposed to be comical and goofy at times and for the most part that aspect is handled well but I think they might have gone just a bit too far with this villain; his motivations for acting this crazy don't really make much sense and he literally says and does every supervillain cliché in the book. His costume also looks absolutely ridiculous and it's impossible to take him seriously, however this isn't something that holds the movie down too much. I've also got to mention how amazing J.K Simmons is as J. Jonah Jameson; all I can say is perfect casting choice. This film is a film that certainly has dated, however it isn't necessarily a negative point. When you watch it, you can instantly tell that it's from the early 2000s, whereas watching the other two you'll have a harder time working out what time period it's from. It's mainly the style of the film which has made it dated, the biggest reason being the character of the Green Goblin for me. Like I said, this isn't necessarily a negative point but something I felt should be said. Conversely, the style is also something which makes the movie unique as what it is and gives it the comic-book feel, but not going too over-the-top (most of the time anyway). The style adds for plenty of humour which was refreshing to see and makes the movie even more charming. Overall, I don't really have anything else to say about this movie and I thought it was really good, with a great lead character and a director who clearly understands the material. It's a film that has certainly dated, however it isn't necessarily a bad thing. 7.8/10
10.0~Stan Lee should be proud! kveltri Sign in Permalink Finally, an adaptation with some punch. Yes, there are a few details that have been changed, but all in all, excellent work. There are plenty of hilarious, surprising, and audience-jumping-in-their-seats moments. Lots of good set up: check the credits, Eddie Brock is there. J.K Simmons is the standout as Jameson, finally the man gets a good role. Willem Dafoe was the only person who could have played the Green Goblin, an excellent villain to chose. I was skeptical about Tobey Maguire, but he was an excellent Peter Parker, Kirsten Dunst looked great, good as MJ. The best part of the film? For Sam Raimi fans, it will be Mr. Bruce Campbell as the ring announcer, Ted Raimi filling in at Jameson's office, and Lucy Lawless virtually unrecognizable as the punk rock chick. For Spider-man fans, look to the great story set-up, and the scenes with his hokey costume. For action fans, the scene during the festival and the one on the bridge will prove amazing. The New Yorkers, throwing stones at Goblin, saying "you mess with one of us, you mess with all of us" is easily one of the best lines in the movie. Go see this movie! And then go pre-order the DVD.
1.0~Already overrated, overhyped and just plain boring. H I/I H Sign in Permalink I knew from the previews that the movie had a campy 70's feel to it. It would have been OK with me had the movie not tried to take itself to seriously. There is cheesy love story that's been done a million times before. The scenes between Peter Parker and Mary Jane are the most boring to watch. Aunt May is a bland character. I laughed out loud when she screamed "Those horrible yellow eyes!" I chuckled during Uncle Ben's big speech "With great powers come great responsibilities" ooo wee! Why is Green Goblin wearing a Power Ranger suit? And what's up with Spider-man's voice? Sounds like he missed the puberty. Maybe Sam Raimi was not a good choice, considering how his "Darkman" sucked. Batman 1 and 2 and Superman 1 still remain the benchmarks for a superhero movie.
7.0~Okay WakenPayne Sign in Permalink This Is An Okay Film Not A Flop Not A Masterpiece. The Plot Is That Peter Parker who is a nerdy high-schooler. He was orphaned as a child, bullied by jocks, and can't confess his crush for his stunning neighborhood girl Mary Jane Watson. To say his life is "miserable" is an understatement. But one day while on an excursion to a laboratory a runaway radioactive spider bites him... and his life changes in a way no one could have imagined. Peter acquires a muscle-bound physique, clear vision, ability to cling to surfaces and crawl over walls, shooting webs from his wrist ... but the fun isn't going to last. An eccentric millionaire Norman Osborn administers a performance enhancing drug on himself and his maniacal alter ego Green Goblin emerges. Now Peter Parker has to become Spider-Man and take Green Goblin to the task... or else Goblin will kill him. They come face to face and the war begins in which only one of them will survive at the end. Now Spiderman As A Comic Isn't My Sort Of Thing I Prefer Darker Comics Like Moon Knight, Ghost Rider, Blade, Man-Thing etc & This As A Movie Yes Will Live Up To The Expectations Of The Readers & Small Children (Because He Is The Most Iconic Marvel Superhero(I Didn't Say Best I Just Said Iconic)) All In All A 6/10 From Me
5.0~just another movie kusalmaduranga Sign in Permalink Spider-Man, Peter Parker have everything. a brilliant mind , superpower comparing to iron man but he is willing to be a loser
7.0~Very good, but could have been just a little better BeornTheBee-man Sign in Permalink I'm a comic book collector, with tons of Spidey experience, so that can't help but influence my review. On the one hand, they got a lot right. I've seen a lot worse when it comes to comic book adaptations. They treated this with some reverence. On the other hand, there were aspects that seemed to not be entirely well thought out. I won't go into detail, but it could have been just a little better. A few plot holes, and a little bit of summer blockbuster hyperbole that wasn't really necessary. I would have liked to give it at least 8, but I gave it a 7 out of 10.
9.0~"This is my gift. My curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man." 10 years later, it's still amazing! joetufano719 Sign in Permalink Before I saw this movie, I didn't really care for Spider-Man that much. Summer of 2002 when it came out, my Dad and I went to see it and I thought it was incredible! Even today 10 years later, I still get a thrill out of it, and it's a movie that has stayed in my imagination for a long time. It's a great origin story about how Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) becomes Spider-Man after being bitten by a genetically engineered spider, and becomes a superhero after his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson, RIP) is killed by a carjacker. He later battles the Green Goblin who is really Norman Osborn, the father of Peter Parker's best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco). I still love how the movie ends. Peter is walking away from Mary Jane who has just kissed him and realized that he could be Spider-Man since she kissed Spider-Man earlier in the movie. In a voice over, Peter says, "Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: 'With great power comes great responsibility.' This is my gift. My curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man." And it shows Spider-Man swinging through New York City. Tobey Maguire is in my view, the best actor to play Peter Parker/Spider-Man yet, and accurately captures the awkwardness and caring personality of the character. Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane is great even though I wish she didn't play damsel in distress so much in this movie. My Dad and I joke around about the famous scene where she and Spider-Man kiss each other in the rain with Spider-Man hanging upside down. As for, Willem Dafoe who plays the main antagonist Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, he is insanely good, since he always plays an excellent bad guy, and the rest of the cast such as Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson and J.K. Simmons bring their "A" game. Sam Raimi was an excellent choice for the director since he was a big fan of the Spider-Man comics as a kid. He definitely brought what he knew into the story, even though he made some changes in this version. Honestly, I don't have a problem with changes he made. I know that because of the new Spider-Man coming out this year, fans of that film are hating this movie and the other two and embracing the new one. In all fairness, I will always love Sam Raimi's trilogy regardless of how successful the new Spider-Man films are even though I'm looking forward to the new series. 10 years later, I still give this movie a thumbs up.
10.0~BEST FILM... EVER!!! Comiccritic83 Sign in Permalink WARNING: PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS! "Spider-Man" isn't just the best comic-book based film ever... it's the best FILM ever. I know it seems odd to say that about a comic book based film, but I stand by my statement. "Spider-Man" has the right amount of story, humor (and when it does show up, it isn't forced) and, above all else, heart. Tobey Maguire gives the best performance of the cast as 17-year-old high school student Peter Parker, who eventually becomes the web-spinning Spider-Man after a bite from an escaped genetically-designed super spider during a field trip to Columbia University's Science Department. His relationships with the rest of the cast work beautifully, from his heart-to-heart talks with his Aunt May (played by Rosemary Harris) or with the woman he's loved since she moved next door to him at age 6, Mary Jane Watson (the gorgeous and talented Kirsten Dunst). Visually - in terms of art-direction, costumes, etc. - the film is dazzling, with great performances from the cast - especially James Franco as Peter's troubled friend Harry Osborn, J.K. Simmons as the underused publisher of the Daily Bugle newspaper, J. Jonah Jameson, Cliff Robertson as Peter's Uncle Ben, and even Willem Dafoe, who plays Norman Osborn/the evil Green Goblin, Harry's father and Peter's/Spider-Man's worst enemy. The sound is great, and the musical score by Danny Elfman has some of the best themes to ever come out of his career (among such other memorable scores by Elfman like "Edward Scissorhands" and "Batman"). However, no film is perfect. Despite some editing flaws, the worst fact about "Spider-Man" is that it isn't for kids. The violence and language see to that. When I saw this film in the theatres 22 times (you read right -- 22!!!), I noticed kids crying during some of the fight scenes or the scene where the Goblin crashes into Aunt May's home (or even just scenes showing the Goblin in general) scared the little kiddies so bad that several parents took their young ones out of the theatres. Just because "Spider-Man" is based on a comic character who has been seen in various cartoon series for children, it doesn't mean the FILM version is appropriate. It IS PG-13 for a reason. Nevertheless, "Spider-Man" delivers it all and more, with memorable performances, some of the music beautiful and heroic musical score from Danny Elfman's career, a good story, a good moral and, best of all, 2 hours of web-spinning excitement. That, and an upside-down smooch between Spider-Man and Mary Jane in the pouring rain. 'Nuff said, indeed.
10.0~The beginning of a great franchise! TalesfromTheCryptfan Sign in Permalink Nerd Peter Parker (Tobey Mcguire) is a lovable loser whom always had a crush on a beautiful redhead named Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst)as he wants her to like him. One day he gets bitten by a radioactive spider and has been given spider-like abilities like organic webs he can shoot out of his wrist, the strength of a spider, spider-sense and can climb walls as it changes his life forever! his uncle Ben recently died and avenges his death as he becomes a costumed crusader named "Spider-Man" who's job is to protect the people of the city from harm. Richard scientist Norman Osbourne (William Defoe) has been given an experiment that causes him to have superhuman strength and endurance with a new personality called "The Green Goblin" with a green costume and a glider to take down the web-slinger. The movie that started a new comic book film franchise has dazzled audiences around the world and like "Blade 1 & 2" and "X-Men" this movie was a revolutionary movie based on a Marvel comic book. For years this movie was in development since 1985 when Cannon pictures got the rights to do a movie when it was shelved until they sold the rights to Carolco pictures with some potential directors like James Cameron, David Fincher, Ang Lee (Whom later did "Hulk") and Albert Pyun but never saw the light of day until 2000 when Sony bought the rights for the picture especially Sam Raimi who was chosen to direct it. The film opened in may 2002 making it one of the most popular movies ever with great casting, fantastic acting, good special effects and a nice storyline made it a true crowd pleaser. The sequel is even better and more improved then this one!
10.0~As good as expected and more prosk8girl Sign in Permalink I enjoyed Spider-Man for many reasons.It was action packed, fun to watch, didn't drag on, and Tobey is cute. The movie was good for ages. I think the writers did a very good job. One thing i didn't like was when he was learning his powers. I think they should have added a little more. But it was funny anyway. I can't wait to see the sequel. I think everyone should give it a chance. Even the star wars fans. The acting and story line was great. Good job on making it like the comic. I rate it 10 out of 10.
4.0~Batman Redux andyhulsey Sign in Permalink This movie wasn't awful, but it wasn't as great as the critics want you to believe. The plot after Peter Parker's fateful encounter with a genetically altered spider is essentially taken from the original Batman movie, except it's not as dark. The special effects are circa 1999 but they do offer the audience the feeling of what it's like to swing through NYC. The acting was solid, especially from Macquire, who I was concerned about before seeing the film. On the whole though, even though I've waited for a Spider-Man movie for what seems like a lifetime, the movie took no risks and accomplished nothing new for the genre. The first two Batman movies are still the best superhero movies ever made and, if you've seen the first Batman, you've basically seen a darker, better version of this movie. Bottom line: Don't believe the hype. While critics bash Star Wars for its cheesy dialogue and half-sketched characters, this movie, as well as most others for that matter, has its fair share of groaners and stereotypes. Watch Batman again, it's better.
10.0~The best comic book movie to date mrtacoman Sign in Permalink There has never been a better movie based on a comic book, I must say. Sam Raimi and his cast have perfectly captured the spirit and movements of Spider-Man. If you're a big fan of Raimi or Marvel comics look for the cameo appearances by Ted Raimi, Bruce Campbell and Stan "The Man" Lee. Tobey Maguire has proven to me that he is more than just a drama kind of guy, as he was excellent in this sci-fi/action/drama. Kirsten Dunst was better than I thought she would be as Mary Jane, and Willem Dafoe is probably the greatest villain actor in Hollywood. GO SEE SPIDER-MAN!!!
3.0~I saw this because I love the comic book... But it didn't stay true ajmayowski Sign in Permalink I am a huge fan of the comic book series, so I decided to check this out, thinking it'd be like the series. WRONG! SPOILERS FROM HERE ON IN! Mary Jane Watson and Peter don't get together? Hmmmmm... Not right. Nor is anything else, for that matter. In the Ben Riley Spider Man Saga, He invents web shooters. He doens't get them. Oh, yeah, one more thing- that spider bite left no mark. Don't see this movie if you liked the comic.
8.0~great movie, but... jusbaize Sign in Permalink I thought Spider-Man was a great movie, but the song they picked for the theme- "Hero" is AWFUL. In 10 years, when we watch Spider-Man, it will seem so dated, due to that song.
10.0~This is what a comic book movie should be. apk2043 Sign in Permalink I saw Spider-man last night and I won't deny that I've been waiting for this movie. Not just because it was Spider-man but also because I've been waiting for a movie based on a comic that is truly excellent. Sure Batman was good but let's get real that was 13 years ago. Spider-man shows how well a comic book can be translated into an exciting movie and still hold true (for the most part) to the comic. Spider-man also has excellent character development throughout the picture. I didn't see Kirsten Dunst only Mary Jane, she was that good, and Tobey Maguire was an excellent choice for Peter Parker. About Willem DaFoe as the Green Goblin and Norman Osborne, I can only say Holy Crap! He was amazing. The music was the only real problem I had with the movie, I guess Danny Elfman was just off this time. I've heard some people complain about the end, but I liked it. All I'll say is that it fit the comic and the character. I can't wait for the sequel!!!
10.0~A lot of fun, and unexpected depth! SPOILERS kaylenns Sign in Permalink I admit to having only known the barest of details about the Spider-Man story before going into the theater, but I found myself drawn deeply into caring about the characters, even unexpected ones. I had been skeptical about Maguire, but he turned out to be completely perfect for the part, and Dunst was wonderful and muted at the same time. Kudos to Franco, as well, for making me really feel sorry about his character. It's rare to find yourself really caring about an aimless rich kid who's taking the hero's girl. :) Dafoe had a moment here or there, but I mostly found his performance lacking true pizzazz. Perhaps it was the comic-book dialogue that he had with his floor-to-ceiling mirror. In any case, there was very little wit in his performance, and he didn't really appear to be enjoying himself, just functioning as the requisite bad guy. All of the Peter Parker "real-life" stuff was well-written and wonderful. Loved the WWF sequence, and found the ending sequence bittersweet. I figured out what he was going to do about 30 seconds before he did it, which made the scene turn into a twist in my chest. They set up every domino for an awesome sequel. Computer animation sequences for Spider-Man sometimes left something to be desired, but Maguire's enthusiasm for the part made the live-action sequences a joy to behold. Mmmmm. I went into this film expecting some light superhero fun, some witty lines, a pretty girl and man in a spandex suit, and general SFX fluff-and-magic. It did have all those things, but on a very human level, it also had a great deal of weight and interaction that made the whole thing ring true from the bottom up. Great story!
7.0~a great action movie, but... jvframe Sign in Permalink There is no doubt that Spiderman is a great action movie, but it's also one in which romance is a very minor device. It's more tragic than anything that the talented young man nearly shoots his web fluid every time he sees a woman who couldn't have given a damn about him when he was less muscled and lacked assertion. In my version of Spiderman 3, Peter Parker realises that any spidery romance he may have with the opposite sex is doomed to end with himself as the main course at the wedding banquet. Luckily Spiderman finds himself strongly drawn to the new Marvel super hero in town  the openly gay Canadian, Northstar  who teaches him how to really swing from building to building in search of rough trade up to no good. (PS: This one may not get a G rating.)
4.0~Mediocre movie for Americans loco12 Sign in Permalink Well I thought this would be something special after its huge opening in the States. But on wasting a couple of hours of my life I know realise that Spiderman is for Americans only. I just don't get how such a poor movie could take so much at the box office Stateside. But then again Spiderman is an all American hero. Outside of the States the film did very poorly. The effects were poor, compared, say, to The Lord Of The Rings, another blockbuster totally worthy of that name. Yet spiderman took $100 million more in the USA Than LOTR. I guess all those 30 somethings who grew up with the comic had to see it. Warning! Stay well clear. Other than the rather tasty leading female, the movie lacks a story, good acting and good effects. 4/10 at the very best.
7.0~From gawky teen to superhero. Amazing abilities benefit society. michaelRokeefe Sign in Permalink Kudos to director Sam Raimi for giving the human touch to the popular comic book hero. The story is interesting enough and the action moves the story at a good pace. Tobey Maguire is well suited for the part of Peter Parker, but I'm having trouble with him transforming into Spider-Man. Willem Defoe is great as the Green Goblin/Norman Osborn. I am most impressed with Kirsten Dunst and even get a kick out of the red hair. It is also good to see veteran actor Cliff Robertson working again. Over all, the movie is very entertaining. Amazing F/X and the Danny Elfman score deserve credit for this movie's success. I hate to say that SPIDER-MAN is not my choice for this summer's blockbuster. A pretty good movie, but to me not a 'knock your socks off' flick.
8.0~Friendly neighborhood spiderman review SolarFlux Sign in Permalink This is one of the best comic book adaptations to hit the cinema ever! Although it doesn't remain "true" to the book in many respects, the only ones who will care are comic book nerds who don't know how to enjoy themselves (don't take offense, I have a few). The directing was exceptional, in the sense that raimi and his team of wizards (no pun intended) brought that bad boy webslinger to life. He looked like some kind of crime fighting-gymnist, and it was very cool. Decent performances all around, far from oscar worthy, but suitable for a film BASED ON A COMIC. Dafoe in full on goblin mode might have been a little too hammy, even if it was supposed to be, but all around the cast tried, and kirsten dunst is now #1 on my top five list of hottest actresses. Oh kirsten...maybe one day.... another positive thing about Spiderman 2002, they didn't sully the movie with a handful of nu-metal bands on the soundtrack, well, there are some on the soundtrack, butt fortunatley all you hear through the whole movie is the score, they save those "marketing bands" until the end credits. At least I guess they did, I didn't stick around. and finally, the ending strays a little bit away from your standard superhero movie. It was surprisingly refreshing. 7.5/10
8.0~This was a great movie and I not a good witter but responsibility is everything darkmage-87682 Sign in Permalink I like this movie because in this movie it show how peter was going through different stages in the beginning of the movie on how he was the weakest and how he got picked on by bullies after that he got his powers he took down his bully and understand what they are and how to use them then he created new goals and he overcame those challenges but someone important to him died and told him and i quote "with great power comes with great responsibility" that quote stuck with him and to do great things with his powers and to give back to the people and to protect them
10.0~SPIDEY ROCKS!! pnc777 Sign in Permalink This wonderful film adaptation of Marvel comic Spiderman (duh)was just what the dr. ordered. With a perfect balance of fun, action, drama and fantasy, I was overwhelmed with joy. The fact that there hasn't been a worthy film with comic book origins in decades...the last one being Superman, left me with expectations lower than usual about a movie that I was so excited to see. I mean, FINALLY they got it to the big screen. The general public has not earthly idea how long it took to get this out of the corporate politics and into a good directors hands. This movie was shockingly stunning in photography and they took the time on every scene to make it what it should be. The result is tragically beautiful. If this film was a rose, it has just bloomed. I would not hesitate to take children to see it, my son being 4 and he has no problems. Thankfully there were no cusswords, especially unnecesary ones (The word B*tch in The Grinch, as if that was needed AT ALL, especially since mostly children went to see it)and the only thing I would worry about is one scene in particular where the Green Goblin (William DeFoe) seems especially creepy. The casting was perfect. I cannot think of anyone better to play the main characters. That they brought Spiderman back to humanity (I mean his behavior) was wonderful and much needed. He makes mistakes just like we do. He has downfalls...failures and it makes his character all the more charming. If I were a movie critic, this one would have all thumbs up. GO SEE THIS MOVIE AGAIN AND AGAIN! You will not regret it! TTFN!
10.0~Does the Marvel Comic proud TLBreedlove Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi and company have captured the essence of The Amazing Spider-Man comic I grew up with. Everything was spot on and I haven't quit smiling from the time the opening credits rolled. Tobey Maguire was Peter Parker for me. Everything was there: the dorkiness, the shyness, and even the goofy one-liners (as Spider-Man) that were so prolific in the comic. His longing for Mary Jane, who is always just out of reach, really took me back to the comics heyday. Peter Parker has always been the character most teens who read comics felt in touch with because he had so many of the same problem as the rest of us, and again, it was laid out beautifully before my eyes today. The relationship between Peter and the Osborns was laid out perfectly as well. It was pretty much as a remember it from the comic and was done as well as could be while being crammed into a two hour movie. Harry and Norman Osborn played a huge role in Parker's life throughout much of the comics history, so it's only fitting that they should be do predominant is the film. As well, I was surprisingly touched by Uncle Ben and Aunt May who are such an essential part of who Peter Parker is. Sam Raimi paid attention to character in this movie and it pays off in spades. My thanks to all who were involved in the film for making me feel like a kid again.
9.0~Perfect adaptation sonofjorelx Sign in Permalink This was a perfect adaptation of a timeless comic book. The film makers truly capture the essence of Spider-Man. Maguire is perfect in the role of Peter Parker. This is Sam Rami's best movie since the Evil Dead Series.
9.0~Good movie Mitch-25 Sign in Permalink Although I am NOT a fan of comic books, I did see this, and was impressed. Spiderman is a character we can all find common ground with. Before he changes, he is a geeky teenager always being picked on. And after his change, he is able to stand up for himself. I liked that part of the story. I liked Toby McGwire as Spiderman/Peter Parker. I didn't think I would before, but I did after I saw him. I also like Willem Defoe as the Green Goblin. I think he was just the right guy for that part. He was a sympathetic character with a very dark side. I also liked the ending. It left a HUGE hole for more movies, and I like that because I liked this movie.
8.0~Superior hokum Balthazar-5 Sign in Permalink I was attracted to Spider-Man, not by the hype - or even the names of Sam Raimi and the brilliant Tobey Maguire - but the most brilliant trailer since Titanic. How did it measure up??? Let's get one thing out of the way... there is little if any philosophical depth to the movie. But on a stylistic level, Raimi and his collaborators have done a very good job both of establishing a couple of fine central characters and reproducing on film the zip-zap highly accelerated narrative structure of the original comics.(And doubtless Stan Lee must and should take come considerable credit for that). There are some lovely scene transitions that bring thematic echoes along with narrative economy, and the scene in which Parker realises the nature of his new-found powers is a model of emotional gear-change in modern cinema. Finally (leave the best to last), Maguire is magnificent - arguably his best role since the glorious Ice Storm. No cinephile should feel embarrassed to see this film - but keep your eye on the style and don't expect too much in the content.
8.0~Very good superhero movie ITTMovieFanatic Sign in Permalink "Spider-Man" is an exceptional superhero movie that's good fun. As far as superhero movies go, it's not as good as "Batman" and the first two "Superman" films, but it falls right behind them. "Spider-Man" is based on the Marvel comic books about nerdy teenager Peter Parker, who gets bitten by a mutated spider and then slowly turns into the crime fighting hero of the title. The movie's special effects run hot and cold throughout, and the story could have used a little tightening. But still there's much to enjoy here. The action scenes are exciting and held my interest. Tobey Maguire is very good as Spider-Man/Peter Parker, and he gets terrific support from a very good cast. Director Sam Raimi has come a long way since directing "The Evil Dead", and I think he'll be a major directing force to reckon with in years to come. "Spider-man 2" is proof of that. **** (out of four)
8.0~Army of One formicidae Sign in Permalink Spiderman: The Movie was well worth the wait, and I'm glad Sam Raimi ended up getting the job instead of James Cameron. This is one of those comic book adaptations that lives up to the original vision by respecting the fundamental elements and treating the material with integrity. At the same time, it isn't afraid to add a couple of new touches, which in this case, doesn't detract from the classic, and in fact, might improve it. (If only the Batman franchise had received this kind of care...) The nuts and bolts: Acting/casting: very good. Special effects: very good. Storytelling: very good. Cinematography: very good. Direction: very good Specifically, Maguire is a super Peter Parker/Spiderman, and Cliff Robertson was a really effective Uncle Ben. (Honorable Mention to "Bonesaw") Everything looks good and moves well, which I think is a credit to Sam Raimi of "Army of Darkness" fame. To anyone considering him a "B grade" director, I say "Ha"! With "A Simple Plan" and "The Gift", "Spiderman" nicely rounds out his recent roster of quality moviemaking--"mainstream" but with flashes of creativity and originality. Recommended. If you're a fan of the comics, then highly recommended. 8/10
9.0~Worth the price of admission schne042 Sign in Permalink The X-Men promotions harped on the fact that it was "true" to the comic, and it wasn't. I thought Spider-Man was more "true" to the comic than X-Men, and they never mentioned it in the promotions. Probably because the one obvious difference from the comic book was actually done better in the film. The only real problem was I thought they made the web material too elastic. Real spider web material is not that elastic. Oh, well, a very minor detail. All-in-all an excellent movie.
1.0~Spiderman  Forever Ruined bregund Sign in Permalink There are spoilers in this review. First of all, the casting of Tobey Maguire for the lead role is the film's biggest mistake. With his pointy lip, jumbo ears, big nose, and squeaky voice, he resembles Screech from Saved By The Bell (I take it Dustin Diamond wasn't available). Much like Michael Keaton in Batman, Maguire doesn't even remotely resemble the title character. Since we're talking about miscast superheroes, thank god they didn't make that Superman movie starring Nicholas Cage. Maguire isn't the only miscast actor in this dud. Aunt May is annoying, Kirsten Dunst is a terrible actress and Willem Dafoe as the squeaky-voiced Green Goblinwell, let's just say that boy aint right. They emasculated the J. Jonah Jameson character; in the comic book he's a huge, scary, angry editor who resembles a wrestling character, but in the film he's a meek, squeaky-voiced, accountant-looking guy with all the screen presence of Droopy the dog. What is it with the squeaky voices? About the only actor who resembles one of the characters is Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben, who doesn't die of a heart attack as he did in the comic book. Couldn't they keep anything authentic? You know all those really cool special effects showing Spiderman looping through the city between the buildings? Well, about ninety-seven percent of the film contains scenes that are not that. Which is to say that three percent of the film doesn't contain scenes that are boring and stretched out endlessly until you want to gouge out your eyeballs with a rusty spike. The chemistry between Maguire and Dunst is ice-cold. There are long stretches of boring, pointless scenes that do nothing for the film, such as the wrestling scene. Parker wants money to buy a car so he can impress MJ. What was the point of all this? Spiderman should be out saving people's lives and stopping crime, not worrying about getting money for a car. This film is laced with continuity and character problems. The Green Goblin has absolutely no reservations about destroying a balcony full of people, including his own son, and yet when the people on the bridge throw trash at him how does he react? By letting them throw trash at him. Why didn't he just blow them away? And just because Osborne kills the board of directors does not make their decision non-binding. If Osborne was thrown out for being inept, it's almost assured that the new board of directors would do the same thing. And the ending is a real problem: Harry blames Spiderman for his father's death, but how would Harry know that? Spiderman would have to tell Harry that he killed his father, in which case he would have to tell him that a) it was an accident b) his father was really the Green Goblin This dry, pointless, barren film has singlehandedly sucked all the fun and joy out of Spiderman forever.
7.0~I would have rated it even higher, but little too long for me. bshupe2 Sign in Permalink I enjoyed the refreshing special effects and unique main character, but it just seemed to go on a little too long. The evil elements of the enemy was a little intense for some little kids. It was almost along the lines of a "satan possessed" being, which I never saw any references to, before seeing the movie. The depiction of good and evil was appropriate, and not distorted as it is in some films today.
10.0~The Amazing, The Spectacular, The Ultimate: Spider-Man gak5 Sign in Permalink "Spider-Man" 2002 I remember the first time that I saw the first "official" theatrical trailer for "Spider-Man" which featured the music by E.S. Posthumus called "Pompeii", which the trailer ended with in the climactic "Nineveh". From then until its release, I knew that my boyhood dreams were about to come true. This is personally one of the few highly anticipated films that I saw on its theatrical release that not only met but ultimately surpassed all of my expectations, successfully re-channeling my childhood romance with this iconic character & taking his epic tale to even greater heights. "Spider-Man" tells the tale of Peter Parker, a mild mannered teenager who constantly seeks acceptance from his peers & ultimately dreams of one day gaining the courage to confess his love to Mary Jane Watson, who is the girl of his dreams. But his life takes a remarkable turn when he is bitten by a genetically enhanced super-spider while on a high school field trip. He miraculously gains superhuman powers that reflect that of a spider's abilities. He finds that he is able to, strangely, shoot webbing from his wrists, detect in coming danger, climb walls, & has superhuman strength and flexibility. After accepting his powers, Peter then seeks to use them for personal gain. But when he fails to stop a criminal that later murders his beloved uncle, he learns a tragic yet valuable lesson: "With great power comes great responsibility." Peter then vows to never let what happened to his Uncle Ben happen to anyone else & becomes Spider-Man! "Spider-Man", unlike many comic to film adaptations, succeeds in revealing the true essence of the man behind the hero's mask. It also grabs the heart of its audience by presenting Peter Parker as an ordinary person at heart as it captures his everyday struggles to live an ordinary life while protecting the streets of New York in the guise of this iconic hero. Toby Maguire is terrific as Peter, as he nails his nerdy yet charismatic charm as well as Spider-Man's confident personality & amazingly mirrors his phenomenal physique. Ultimately, "Spider-Man" delivers in its story telling, special effects, & well choreographed action sequences. Five stars, & two thumbs up.
4.0~Too long, very little happens khouston86 Sign in Permalink This movie is way too long--over 2 hours, and it seems very long--for its simple, uneventful plot. I have read here that the movie deviates from the comic story in major ways. Some of the things left out--the whole Gwen Stacey thing, for example--might have helped here. Much of the final half of this movie just feels like empty space. It is as if the pacing of the movie was determined by James Franco, who is unbelievably irritating and slow in his role here as Peter's best friend. (I realize that he is probably supposed to play a kind of loser, but he didn't have to be that dim-witted, I don't think.) The teenage angst stuff at the beginning worked well. But the movie was way too long, very little happened, Kirsten Dunst looked unattractive, the Goblin was boring, and the tone was sometimes too flighty. ****Possible Spoiler**** Because the tone is not sufficiently serious, and the characters are not well-developed (the whole prior dead lover guilt Gwen Stacey thing is left out) and because the movie wears out its welcome, Peter's declaration of non-love to Mary Jane at the end comes off as not only disappointing, but also as cruel, annoying and inexplicable. ***end of spoiler***
9.0~Excellent! JamesMetal1 Sign in Permalink Ok, I thought that the cast didn't make sense when they put Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane, but after I saw the movie, I realized " She IS Mary Jane." Tobey Maguire is excellent as Spider-Man. He really fit into the role as the nerdy Peter Parker in the start of the film. Tobey should be doing a lot more action films now that he's become very buff. As for Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, he was great. I liked the way his voice sounded as a caring person and an evil villian. Now, the plot was much better than in the series. It is better that he doesn't have to put in web cartridges all time. Plus, it was very interesting to have Uncle Ben murdered outside the house and having that chase to realize that it his his duty to become a hero. I give this one a perfect 10.
9.0~In the Hearts of True-Believers surly_canadian Sign in Permalink I would just like to address all the people out there who complained, griped and otherwise whined about how "fake" and "unbelievable" it was. GROW UP!!! Jesus, are you people ever picky. One more thing, which will justify your complaints, but also explain why you're stupid to have them: IT'S NOT BASED IN REALITY!!! That having been said I would now like to go into my review. "Spider-Man", for all intended purposes delivered well, considering all the competition it had from other movies... among them, some science fiction movie....I can't remember the title. Tobey Maguire did a fantastic job as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. His physical commitment to the film shows just the caliber of actor he really is and is a testament to his professionalism. The one thing that weirded the hell out of me, was his voice. When he yells, his voice actually gets higher in pitch. While he speaks, however, his voice carries well. Kirsten Dunst is a fabulous actress. I've been following her since "interview", and she played the part well as MJ. Actually I had no problems with her until a friend of mine (a woman, of course) pointed out that she doesn't work as a redhead. She's too pale. True enough I figured...this friend of mine is a redhead with a darker complexion and shes Hot! Willem Dafoe. I cant even begin to describe him. He's evil. He's cut-throat. He's a father. He has brought a performance so unique and interesting, that it can only be matched by Jack Nicholson. Or vise versa. Willem Dafoe is one of those cool actors who has done everything possible, so now he's earned the right to have a fun role. And you can tell he had fun in this role. Actually, he's cool just judging by his name. Willem, Willem, Willem.... Now the supporting cast. JK Simmons is a really good mean guy (REALLY REALLY GOOD) Rosemarry Harris is worrisome, and motherly, and Cliff Robertson dies. The supporting cast is all top-notch, they all pull their weight and carry their scenes well. As for JK Simmons....He MAKES a couple scenes as JJ. The Special Effects were very good. I cant believe how many people complained of how fakely the movie represented a skinny (but built) teenager in a bright red and blue, skin-tight suit, swinging down 80 stories and recoiling up at speeds of 70 mph, while shooting out a sticky fluid out of his wrist as he chases down a green man in a bionic suit linked to a jet glider. Actually....now that I read what I just said....your right...how fake!!!! (idiots...) And finally, because I fear I'm nearing 1000 words. I would like to rate this film 4.5 stars out of 5. If you want to know my other thoughts on Spider-man, e-Mail me....I love mail. And for all you who think I'm too biased in favor of Spider-Man....why don't you tell that to my Spidey Tattoo?
10.0~One of the grandest movie experiences in my life. Duck_of_Death23 Sign in Permalink As an avid fan of the comic book super-hero "Spider-Man", I found myself disappointed watching the trailer during the theatrical showing of The Lord of the Rings. To me, Spider-Man appeared to be corny and hokey, along with cheesy visual effects and ridiculous costumes such as The Green Goblin. To me, awaiting the film as long as I had, the pain was too large to bear. I had been waiting since 1992, when James Cameron announced his screenplay. Since than, I myself have been patiently waiting and hoping for a good Spider-Man movie. But when I saw the trailer in December, I felt slightly cheated... ...Than fast forward to May 3rd. I went to the movies with my friends to see "Deuces Wild". But, one of my friends misinterpreted our intentions to see Deuces, so he went in to see the titled, "Movie of the summer": Spider-Man. To be honest, I didn't want to see Deuces Wild, at least not with the missing eight dollars from my wallet. To me, Deuces Wild was a "Wait-for-video-movie" if you know what I mean. With this, I felt bad and didn't want him to go in the theater all by his self, so I quickly exchanged my ticket and got a seat to see it with him. I was going to see it the next day with my mother, but I guess I couldn't wait that long. So, I saw Spider-Man and left the theater with a love for a movie I didn't know that I could ever have. To me, this was the best super-hero movie I had ever seen. It's story was so compelling that when Peter Parker donned his spandex costume, it seems not only irrelevant, but unnecessary. This movie was so attentive that it followed and loved it's characters, not berating and using their misery to feed the mindless cliche-filled plot. The movie cared about what they were and who they were to become. Unlike every other comic book based movie I've ever seen, this one didn't use the characters to simply feed the story itself. Spider-Man's story was the characters. Without doubt, this has to be the classic comic book movie brought to life for all time. As far as comic books translated to film are concerned, Spider-Man is and always will be, "THE DEFINITIVE COMIC BOOK PICTURE OF ALL TIME!!! Even though many didn't like the visual effects and saw them as the films fatal flaw, I LOVED THEM. First of all, it's a motif to the graphic novels. It isn't meant to be realistic. A comic books reality is it's own little world and it would only be fair to include some aspect of that comic into the film. The human side was convincing and realistic. It pulled it off and hit the nail on the head better than a lot of Oscar winning movies even. One of the central themes that runs through the film is about teenagers and their inabilities to express their true feelings to one another. Films like American Beauty fail to explore this degree of emotions simply because the synopsis focuses on the proverbial dark side of these situations. Comics, on the other hand, are an "Expedient exaggeration" of the real life world we live in. A satire if you will. Come on! How many maniac criminals would dress up in a green metallic suit and a dinosaur mask with "pumpkin bombs" and a futuristic one-man glider with super-sonic jet speed in real life? I left the theater gleeful, fulfilled and waiting to see it again the next day with my mother.
10.0~Equals Blade series in trueness to its origin kingvegeta8 Sign in Permalink I saw this movie last night and even through all of the hype I was still surprised at how good it was. I am a big fan of Sam Raimi and feel this is his crowning achievement. The only problem I had with the movie was the fact that Peter Parker didn't invent his web-shooters and fluid. The movie didn't give much time to his science career. It showed him winning a science award but that is one of the things I liked about the comic book. Not only was he strong, fast, and agile, but he was brilliant. It was this intelligence which set him apart from most other heroes. All of the character portrayals were right on and the special effects were superb. I recommend this movie to everyone.
7.0~Good Action Scenes TheMasterCritic Sign in Permalink Story was very similiar to the comic. Much better than i thought it would be. The action scenes were amazing, the special effects were great. With the exception of the Green Goblin's actual costume(very bad). My main complaint is that the movie was to short, it's the kinda movie thats so good you simply don't want it to end. The ending left something to be wanted.
1.0~this was one bad movie quaspro Sign in Permalink I am a spider-man fan and was so disappointed by this movie. First my expectations weren't that high since the trailers didn't look so good but the movie was much worse. So much focus on a love story, not much action and when there was the action with graphics appear very amateurish...I was completely bored with this movie. William Dafoe was the only good thing about the movie because he played a very good villan. Another thing, is that origins of spider-man in the movie was different from the comic book especially how spider-man generates his web (no spoilers yet). Just remember the fact that a spiders in nature spins web with its mouth. I strongly recommend not seeing this movie until you can rent it and I for one will not watch any of sequels since this movie was typical of hollywood hype to generate money and diasppoint viewers.
10.0~One Of The Best Superhero Movie Desertman84 Sign in Permalink Spiderman is a superhero film that is based on the fictional Marvel Comics character Spiderman. The film stars Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, a high-school student who turns to crime fighting after developing spider-like powers. Spider-Man also stars Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn, Kirsten Dunst as Peter's love interest Mary-Jane Watson, and James Franco as his best friend Harry Osborn.After incorporating elements of comic book style and design into many of his films, director Sam Raimi helms this straight-ahead, big-budget comic book adaptation, which also marks acclaimed young actor Tobey Maguire's first dip into live-action blockbuster film-making. Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris co-star to play key supporting roles. Spiderman follows the template of the original Stan Lee/Steve Ditko source material, with hero Peter Parker an orphaned, intellectual teen loner living in Queens with his aunt and uncle, and dreaming of the girl next door, Mary Jane. On a field trip to a Columbia University lab, Peter is bitten by a genetically altered spider and overnight he gains superhuman strength, agility, and perception. At first, Peter uses his powers for material gain, winning a wrestling match with a purportedly lucrative prize. But when Peter apathetically fails to stop a burglar from robbing the wrestling arena, a tragedy follows that compels him to devote his powers to fighting crime as the superhero Spiderman. When he's not busy fighting crime in a spider suit, Peter moves into an apartment with his best friend, Harry, and begins work as a photographer at the Daily Bugle. Meanwhile, his do-gooder alter ego finds a nemesis in the form of the Green Goblin, a super-powered, megalomaniacal villain who happens to be the alter ego of Harry's father, weapons-manufacturing mogul Norman Osborn. Spiderman provide a good dose of web-swinging fun.Also,it also has a heart.Credit that to the combined charms of director Sam Raimi and star Tobey Maguire. Added to that,it captures the high-energy, pulpy effervescence of Marvel when it was young and feisty. Whatever imperfections the film picks up along the way, they practically demand to be hand-waved aside as it effectively takes time between exhilarating digital effects to develop character and motivation. Colorful, energetic and well-cast,it is a good-quality, highly-entertaining action movie.
10.0~Good movie with some minor annoyances.. knightsend2k1 Sign in Permalink I liked this movie quite a bit.It was fun to watch Spidey kick the crap out of the Goblin onscreen....BUT...I had " problems " with a couple of things...I love Sam Raimi's work,and I know he's a fan,so why take out Parker's web shooters ? Although it's mentioned that Pete is quite the bright boy the proof was never in the pudding....his missing web shooters.Raimi has been quoted as saying that " The audience wouldnt believe a kid could come up with something even Dupont couldnt. " ( his web fluid )Let me get this straight Sam old boy,you say the audience wouldnt believe Parker had the smarts to create web shooters, yet you expect them to believe a man can crawl walls like a Spider ? Give me a freaking break.They should have been there.Organic webs was a stupid idea.If it's not broke Sam,dont fix it okay ? The next " odd " thing I had problems with was the Green Goblin's suit.He looked like a Power Ranger.What was up with THAT idea ?!?! Oh,well.Thank God for good performances by Daniel,Kirsten, and Toby.If you like comic movies you'll enjoy this one.....just dont expect perfection,even from the brilliant Sam " The Evil Dead Man " Raimi.
6.0~boring! JFenin Sign in Permalink Simply said: I don't understand all the hype about this film. Yes, the effects are spectacular, but the rest is simply boring. A stupid love story, breaks in the plots and dialogs that are far too long. Towards the end, you can see that the script is written to prepare a sequel. Five points for the effect, 1 point for the story makes six points. Even Star Wars Episode II was better.
8.0~THIS ONE PACKS AN EMOTIONAL WALLOP zach-27 Sign in Permalink Wow! What a great movie! I really enjoyed Spider-Man a lot, from the opening credits to the classy film editing to the heart-tugging romance, so to speak. Yes, this is a comic-book superhero movie, but one that packs an emotional wallop to boot. I expect this one to remain at or near the top of 2002's box office listing for some time. If you haven't seen it yet, be prepared to laugh, cry, and shudder, as you get caught up in the exciting web of Spider-Man. Stay tuned for the sequel, too!
10.0~Excellent movie *** give away warning*** jmclaughlin82 Sign in Permalink This was an excellent movie. Classic tale of good versus evil, set in a modern day setting. I especially like the way that they taught Peter to good with his power, the killing of his uncle by a man he let get away when he had the power to stop him was a great twist. They also thought of calling Mary Jane MJ, a great modern twist. Anyone who has gone to High School in the last few years knows that a girl with a name like Mary Jane wouldn't last 3 minutes with the social elite, especially in a New York high school. Of course she would have a nickname that friends would call her, and what better than MJ. The special effects were great, seamless, all except one scene where he's running across the tops of buildings, and the scenery behind him is obviously fake, it's not moving at nearly the speed he is. Other than that, it's great, from his first experiments with his powers with the bully at school to the ending, where he defeats the Green Goblin. Obvious opening for a sequel though, since we all want him to end up with MJ, but he turns her advances away, knowing that she could get hurt by his powers. And the end of the movie quotes his uncle "With great power comes great responsibility." I generally all around loved it.
8.0~Hey fanboy, get a room! Klausfiend Sign in Permalink ... and make sure all your friends are there. This movie rocks! All my hard work as a kid faithfully watching the Spider-man cartoon on Saturday mornings is finally rewarded. Willem Dafoe is a really creepy (although he was in Wild at Heart, so I think he's had a lot of practice) Norman Osborne. It's the kind of movie every movie based on a comic book should aspire to be. Evil villains, honest heroes who resemble real people, and the well-drawn lines that make comic books the refuge of a bookish youth with a vivid imagination. Some of the effects are a little spotty, but nobody's perfect. ... now if only someone would make a decent live action Batman movie, I'd be happy.
6.0~pretty good FX bring this thing up to a 6 mikel weisser Sign in Permalink when i think of all the movies that are great pieces of cinema (do the right thing and erin brokovich are two that quickly come to mind)it galls me to see spidey in the imdb top 250. cold line readings, extended FX sequences that begin to feel as repetitious as saturday morning cartoons, plot holes you could squirt a web through and plot inanities that reduce this thing to mere merchandising that's plotting a sequel. i watched the saturday morning cartoons religiously as a kid. they were hip and quick and funny. all things this movie is not. worse still, all the actors feel stilted but i'll give special mention to cliff robertson, J.K. Simmons, and kirsten dunst for especially lame performances. there is a particularly bad exchange between the principals right at the end of the movie that is so awful i left the theater muttering. spidey? where art thou sting? bought and sold ... down the river.
6.0~Disappointment for fans Leo13 Sign in Permalink I used to read the comic of this super-hero and I can say that I was a great fan. When I heard that the movie was out on cinemas I urged to watch it. The movie for someone who has not ever read the comic, might seem an excellent work, but for those fans who grew up reading it propably might regard it as average. The director, Raimi, created just a good action movie with a super-hero who impresses the viewer with his skills. The story is good but I think the complaint of most of the real fans is that the director failed to represent Spider-man as he really was in the comics. The character played by Tobie Maguire was disappointing and the fact that he had never read a single issue of the comic prior to the movie, speaks for its self. Let's hope the sequel will be better...
10.0~True to the original Bruce-132 Sign in Permalink I actually remember reading Spiderman #1 several decades ago. The movie is close enough to be true to both the story line and the character to get my vote. Webbing was the exception, but I prefer the movie version in this case.
10.0~So impressed ChiOLadyBug14 Sign in Permalink I wasn't that crazy about going to see Spider-Man but I am so glad I did. The movie was action packed and Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunce did such a wonderful job. I always liked Tobey before this movie but this movie just made me like him so much more. The movie was all in all an A+ and I can't wait for the sequel to come out.
4.0~Truly Unbelievable shanejamesbordas Sign in Permalink One can't really expect too much in the way of enlightenment from a comic book adaptation but even by those standards 'Spiderman' has a dreadfully hokey script rife with cliché and unexplained coincidence. Lest we forget, suspension of disbelief applies even here. A number of the performances are just plain corny (Cliff Robertson certainly milks his small role as Peter Parker's uncle) but Willem Dafoe's theatrically hammy performance does entertain in an Olivier-like fashion. The film has most to offer in its beginning section which features a number of spectacular special effects during our insight into the origins of the hero's super-powers. Later when he becomes fully fledged (with little further explanation as to how he got there) the film looks decidedly more like a video game and will surely fail to sustain interest except in the youngest and most uncritical audiences.
2.0~Didn't Transfer To Screen Well ttbrowne Sign in Permalink Being a big fan of Spidey I remember reading about his first appearance. That's why this was a great disappointment and a huge surprise. First I thought the Maguire kid was greatly miscast. He just doesn't cut it for me. Then there is the fact that they HAD to go back to high school. Ya know, It seemed perfect in the comics but when it transfers to film it looks downright stupid and juvenile. I thought they could've handled that part differently, like in Batman. I didn't care for the lighting and wholesomeness of the film. The Batman films captured that comic book look to a tea. This one seems all sugar and spice and everything nice. I truly believe they made this film for 8-10 years old's. Don't waste your money if you're a true Spiderman fan. Save it and buy one of old comic books.
8.0~Despite its narrative flaws, "Spider-man" hangs tough. zardoz-13 Sign in Permalink "Evil Dead" director Sam Raimi spins an uneven but entertaining web of excitement, suspense, and romance in Columbia Pictures' new live-action "Spider-man" movie based on the venerable Marvel Comics character. Although it lacks the depth and intelligence of Bryan Singer's "X-Men," "Spider-man" compares favorably with Richard Donner's standard-bearing epic "Superman" (1978). Each poked fun at themselves in straight-faced fashion, but neither let their villains overshadow the heroes as Tim Burton did in his Michael Keaton "Batman" yarns. The offbeat but inspired casting of Tobey Maguire as Spider-man and Willem Dafoe as the villainous Green Goblin virtually compensates for two unforgivable flaws which neither Raimi nor veteran scripter David Koepp resolve in an entirely satisfactory manner. Meanwhile, John Dykstra of the original "Star Wars" serves up some credible digital special effects that allow audiences to websling their way vicariously through the Big Apple with Spidey. Happily, these CGI sequences seamlessly integrate with Maguire's dialogue scenes in his red & blue, body stocking costume. Shrewdly, Raimi and Koepp obliterate the "Spider- man" mask during the climactic fight, so Maquire's personality enlivens his heroic posturings. "Spider-man" follows the "Superman" formula about Spidey's origins, so you need not be a Marvel Comics arachnophile to enjoy this blockbuster. The action unfolds in a high school setting like "Can't Hardly Wait" with dorky protagonist, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire of "Wonder Boys") warning the fainthearted about the trials and tribulations that confound a superhero. When we meet him, Peter is obsessed with class beauty Mary Jane Watson (cleavage-baring Kirsten Dunst of "Small Soldiers"), but she doesn't know he exists. They live next door to each other and attend the same senior high in the New York City borough of Queens. The jocks harass Peter unmercifully, but he survives their ridicule with no ill effects. Things change dramatically on a class field trip to Columbia University. A 'genetically designed super spider' bites Peter. When he awakens the following morning, Peter discovers to his disbelief that he no longer needs glasses and has a weight lifter's physique. Miraculously, he finds he can squirt webs out of his wrists and scale walls. Not long afterward, the Green Goblin, a power-hungry maniac on a jet glider who wreaks havoc wherever he flies, confronts Spidey and invites him to team up as his partner-in-crime. Of course, Spider-man refuses, and Goblin attacks Spider-man's aunt and his girlfriend Mary Jane. The worst thing about "Spider-man" is our hero cuts a rather dull figure when we cannot see Tobey Maguire's expressive countenance. The only time Hollywood conceals movie stars is when stunt men double for them. The first half of "Spider-man" surpasses the second half, because the complexity of the former abates during the latter. Inexplicably, Goblin neglects to unmask and/or kill Spidey after he captures him! Later, during a standoff involving a detached cable car, Goblin forces Spidey to choose who to rescue: his girlfriend Mary Jane or the cable car passengers. Predictably, Spidey saves both with one strand. Nevertheless, despite its narrative flaws, "Spider-man" hangs tough.
10.0~The movie was true to the comics...mostly zimfjsl2 Sign in Permalink Overall, this movie was excellent! Being a Spiderman fan since I was a very small child, I found the movie true to the comic books...mostly. Only a couple of things should have been changed. First, I was okay with the concept of Spiderman without web cartridges, but that does add some spice to the character. Second, never have I read that Mary Jane tells Peter Parker that she's in love with him. Still, a little Hollywood isn't too bad. Keeps most of the viewers happy.
10.0~He can do any thing a spider can ThermalHeat Sign in Permalink As a comic book fanboy i didn't like the idea of organic web (in the comic it became one of the reasons for this finacal troubles), but sam raimi put so much chracter into the spider-man it makes u forget all about. the most amazing part about spider-man was in a time where every movie is 90mins to long, sam put so much story in only 2hours. the musical score was awesome and i love willam defoe as the green goblin ( the costume was great). i thought maryjane could have been better, but tobey mcguire as spider-man was too perfect. I feel spider-man has a chance to out do the batman franchise hands down.
10.0~Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words, "with great power comes great responsibility." This is my gift, my curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-man. TheFilmConnoisseur Sign in Permalink ****Excellent ***Good **Fair *Poor After years of development, most notably by director James Cameron Spider-Man finally makes it to the big screen. Like it's predecessors Batman and Superman, Spider-Man is released in it's 40th anniversary and with the help of director Sam Raimi and screenwriter David Keopp the film makes a magical leap into the big screen. Raimi successfully takes us into the world of Peter Parker/Spider-Man and makes this a fun, exciting, and loving story. The phrase `With Great Power comes Great Responsibility' is what inspires the film. And we see how much responsibility Peter Parker has by not only saving the city but protecting his family and love Mary Jane. At the same time battling his best friends father. The film is magical and captures your imagination but what I found a bit interesting was all the references to Batman and Superman. True that the character of Spider-Man himself is a combination of the two like for instance both Spider-Man and Superman work in a newspaper company: Daily Bugle, Daily Planet. Both Batman and Spider-Man became motivated after the death of a love one and they both fall in love with a cat: Black Cat, Catwoman. Who both happen to be a thief Some of the references are the attack in the parade. When the Green Goblin blows up the building and Spider-Man has to save Mary Jane who's falling off. Another is when Peter attacks the robber, the way he appears from the shadows is very similar to the opening sequence in Batman. Also like Batman and Superman the film is full of great performances by Tobey McGuire, the sexy Kirsten Dunst, and Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin. What I loved about this film is that when I was viewing it I felt like a kid again. Watching the film reminded me of when I was a kid and I would watch the TV shows and read the comics and be fascinated with his adventures and the problems he faces and how he solves them. Like Tim Burton's Batman and Richard Donner's Superman. Sam Raimi successfully puts you in the center of his world and makes you understand who Spider-Man is and what he stands for. RATING: 4 STAR
4.0~Spoilers galore alastair_m Sign in Permalink It's really too bad. You'd think the stage would have been set for an outstanding comic book romp. Good, solid cast; direction of Sam Raimi, all brought together by the everlasting appeal of Spider Man; the fearlessly cheesy, noble alter-ego of nice guy geek Peter Parker. But for some reason, it hasn't gelled. The basic story covers Spider-Man's origin and his first battle with his first big super evil bad guy. Oh, and he falls in love too. `Spider-Man's' problem isn't the story. A movie is never so much about its story as it is how it tells its story. And this movie tells its story with cheesy dialogue, one heap of clichés and some sketchy effects. When the side effects of the gas that transforms Willem Dafoe into the Green Goblin are being described, the list terminates with an `iSaNiTy!' so ominous that Adam West would be jealous. And, my God, who the Hell had the idea that they should start calling May Jane' M.J.' (Forgive me if that's what they call her in the comic book.) My name is Alastair, and there are only certain people who can get away with calling me Al. Very few, at that. Peter Parker, being the shy geek that he is, wouldn't be one of them. He should call Mary Jane `Mary Jane' because he's polite and timid and that's just what he'd call her. Plus, they aren't on colloquial enough terms for that. It just sounds phony. As it did whenever anyone else said it, with the exception of a carload of Mary Jane's friends. The intense confrontations between Spiderman and the Green Goblin produce some pretty hard-hitting lines. `Goblin, what have you done!?'; and the Green Goblin's rendition of `The Itsy-Bitsy Spider' are just a few bites of cheese you'll find. Oh, and after Harry thinks Spider-Man has ruthlessly killed his father, not realizing his father was the Green Goblin, `Spider-Man will pay' he assures repeatedly. Geeze. There's more than all of this. Much, much more. I should have taken a notebook to the theater. The script may be a downer, but it's the clichés that kill it. For example, Peter goes back to meet uncle Ben after he's been to the `library.' How many times have we seen someone in a movie instantly force their way to the front of a crowd surrounding a crime scene? Then, shocking tragedy awaits... well, maybe not all that shocking. Earlier on, there's the scene where dude in charge of the wrestling match refuses to give Peter his money promised for the victor. `It's not my problem,' he tells him. (That's not an exact quote. I don't remember the line, perhaps because the line wasn't as great as it thought it was.) So a few minutes later, a burglar steals the money, runs down the hall and Peter doesn't stop him. Buddy from the desk asks Peter why he didn't stop him. Peter repeats the same line. Oh, the poetic justice of it all! And the whole `With great power comes great responsibility.' Ok, we get it. You don't have to keep ramming it down our throats. There are a lot of things in `Spider-Man' that could go unsaid. Not a lot of innovation went into this movie. The story could have been dealt with more originally. We haven't seen anything like the Green Goblin's death before, have we? Peter's revelation that the Goblin is business tycoon and father of his best friend and roommate Harry, Norman Orbson sure hits home (right.) And then his hand grasps upwards through that wall and they share a poignant final moment. It's just sooooooooooo dramatic. Not a lot of innovation went into this movie. The story could have been dealt with MUCH more originally. I didn't have a lot of complaints about the performances. Tobey Maguire was perfect for the lead roll, much better than, shutter, Freddie Prinze Junior would have been. Parker is a geek and so is Maguire. But they're both cool geeks. I usually like Willem Dafoe, here is no exception, even if he wasn't always able to render the insane bantering of his surprisingly two-dimensional character plausible (one situation, however, where he coped especially well were the difficult scenes of his dueling personalities.) Dunst was very pleasing and dealt with the script the best of all (maybe because she didn't have to say M.J.) And J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson seems to have flown in straight from the campy cartoon, in a good way. It's too bad that with all of these characters in the right place, the rest of the movie couldn't have been better. `Spider-Man' couldn't decide whether to be totally cornball or to go for the drama. `X-Men' was shamelessly cheesy, and for that I enjoyed it a lot more. The special effects are, if anything, a little rough around the edges. He might be a super-hero, but Spider-Man isn't in outer space. As a consequence, there's still gravity. Then why does it seem like he's flying half of the time? Maybe it's some aerodynamic mystery like the bumblebee. Other effects are, well, all to obviously effects. But the thing that bothers me the most is that they could have done something really great with this movie, and it would have made just as much money, so why not bother? But who cares what I think, really? I've never really read the comic book much. I just watched the cartoon and looked at some of the cards when I was a kid. If the fans of the book like it, that's what really matters. Although it doesn't sound like some of them are too pleased. I gave this movie a zero. In actuality, I'd give it a four; but a lot more people gave it a ten than should have and now it's in the top 250. Come on, this movie is not better than `The French Connection.'
5.0~See past the hype! Come on! You can do it! WilliamSG Sign in Permalink *Possible Spoilers Alert!* Good grief. I must be person number 12,438,957 to write a review, but I'll do it differently and won't use caps at all. Promise. Ok...let's get started. This movie was done plain wrong. Firstly, Danny Elfman's score was irritating and very OTT. Couldn't they have got someone with some talent? The CGI was annoying to laughable at times, especially during the first part of the movie with Spiderman swinging across the city. He looked like a rubber doll. It actually rivaled "Blade 2" in the 'laughable' stakes. Admittedly the CGI did get a lot better later on. However, when Spiderman catches MJ when she falls from the balcony and swings through the air with her, I thought we were watching the original Superman again. There was quite blatantly a blue screen behind them when we go close up. Onto the acting. Willem Defoe's portrayal of the Green Goblin was adequate enough, and I believe they chose him for the part because of his acting ability, especially in "Shadow of the Vampire" for which he was Oscar nominated at the time. His performance in "Spiderman" was similar in its sinisterness to his role in "Shadow of the Vampire". Tobey Maguire is an astonishingly boring actor. Yes, he was good as Peter Parker because Peter Parker IS incredibly boring. Maguire is phenomenally lacking in charisma though, and I'm not sure he's that great a Spiderman. The feeling just isn't quite right.. That one is definitely open to argument though. Kirsten Dunst had a 'nothing' part. I'm not even sure it's worth even mentioning her. I found it quite sad that a lot of people went to see the movie just for the 'wet top scene.' Perhaps it's because Dunst realises her lack of acting talent and needs another way to attract pre-pubescent boys. Her speech at the end of the movie is so hammy and poorly acted as to make the entire audience burst out laughing. Strangely, the best portrayed parts of the movie belong to Peter Parker's aunt and uncle, who played the comic book parents perfectly. I thought they were excellent. Now the movie...oh dear where do we start? There were so many problems with it! So many plot holes! So many! Why didn't MJ remove Spiderman's mask? Why didn't the Green Goblin remove Spiderman's mask when he had kidnapped him?! My oh my WHAT a plothole! What about the fact that Tobey can hold an entire box car with one hand, but can't kick the Green Goblin back to Neverland without a ton of difficulty. Also, the 'thwipping' through the city never fulfilled it's potential because it all moves so fast. Why couldn't they keep a static camera ever?! It just all moved too fast. Another scene that stands out is when the Green Goblin 'vaporised' all the members of the board on the balcony - which too was ridiculous. There was no real feeling in that scene at all...they just all turned to skeletons. So pathetic! How about the slow motion punch at Spiderman which smashes the pillar, or the way Spiderman dodges the shuriken-like projectiles. "The Matrix" anyone? The NY bravado on the bridge when Spiderman is holding MJ and the box car was also a waste of time and completely ridiculous, - as was the ending where Spiderman leaps onto the US Flag. I'm tired of this patriotic junk. I realise the bridge scene was added in to demonstrate the togetherness of NY after September 11th, but please...I just found it idiotic that they would throw fruit at the Green Goblin. *Beginning to cry* (at times) Sub par special effects, hammy acting, pathetic storyline. Since when can Parker shoot webs from his wrists? Perhaps Stan Lee was paid too much money to care for this adaption. I however, was less than impressed. A wholly forgettable experience. As I look, Spiderman is number 84 in the top 100 films of all time and will probably rise higher as all the 12 year olds who see it in the coming weeks - rate it a 10. The world has indeed gone mad. 5/10
10.0~More of a story than your typical super-hero bobsteimle Sign in Permalink I loved the Spiderman comics when I was a little kid, forty years ago, but all I remembered was a bad guy named the Kingpin. I didn't even remember that Spiderman had a girl friend or an aunt. I didn't expect that the Spiderman movie would have much of a story other than catching crooks, just like flies. Boy, was I wrong. Peter Parker is just a dorky kid like I was. Pretty smart, but not too smooth with the ladies. Definitely not a bragging, trouble-making jerk like some of his peers in the film. When he gets the spider bite, he starts becoming a jerk, though, even sassing his Uncle, who is like a father to him, telling him "you're not my father." This is what makes for a good story. He starts to become bad, then realizes what is happening, and changes himself to become really good. He repents. He rises out of the one dimensional into a character we can really care about. That's what makes a great movie.
8.0~Good morganstephens512 Sign in Permalink I thought it was actually pretty good. The story was told well and the effects were actually pretty good (and for the time probably even better). I thought the Green Goblin was probably one of the best villains I seen for a superhero film. Because it showed his insanity, but it wasn't over the top. I thought the actor for Peter Parker wasn't that great for the first 30 minutes or so, but got pretty good after the death of Uncle Ben. I have no problem believing that when it was released, it was the best superhero movie made. he one thing I will admit I do prefer in the newer films was I actually thought the actor for Uncle Ben did a better job in that one. Not saying this one was bad, but I just was more attached to that one. Maybe I will have to see that one again just to be sure. Since it's been over a year. Overall, a 8.5/10
6.0~Truly depends on how you judge it. HenryHextonEsq Sign in Permalink I'm not going to expend time and verbiage in attacking this film; I haven't the time or inclination. Yes, it is indeed poor in many respects, but I did enjoy it, unlike such "blockbusters" as "Blade II", "The Fast and the Furious" and "The Mummy Returns". Let me concede no vested interests here; I am no "Spiderman" fan of yore. Never read comics or seen the cartoon I don't think. It strangely eluded me really; maybe slightly before my time. I can, I feel, offer a fairly objective view here. Firstly, if anyone judges this movie by a yardstick of realism they would be very foolish. If they were to judge it by a measure of how good a film it is then they would be perhaps more understandably unwise. While I'm setting up the view that it must be viewed as a comic book interpretation, it should be said there have to be grounds for judging bad dialogue etc. on its own terms. An example would have to be the almost painfully two-dimensional and near comatose "emotional scenes" and particularly Kirsten Dunst's performance. There are comic book characters, and there are, well, very bad displays of acting. "I'd like to learn how to act?" I think she pallidly says at one point early on; well, the words seem apposite for Dunst herself. It is a swollen, perhaps thankless performance for an admittedly limited role. Maguire, well, very one-note and not all that impressive, especially as the film wears on. Willem Dafoe, and particularly J.K. Simmons as Jameson give far better ideas of how these sort of larger-than-life creations should be played... J.J. Jameson is an absurd, amusing character pitched at the right level; "They gotta be giving names to these weirdos now!" etc. It is often very difficult to tell whether the film is intentionally or unintentionally funny. The absurd haplessness of Parker's first Spider-Man costume is surely meant, as are certain touches of dialogue. A bizarre bit is where Dafoe, as Norman Osborne, launches a broadside against "MJ", or Mary Jane as she is belatedly known later on in the film. Something like "you should do what you want with her and then broom her!" I must say I laughed, as did my cohorts. Very odd wording and a plain absurd tone to it. Also, what was that Aunt of Parker's doing cropping up all over the place later on in the picture. She seemed to have insinuated herself into Mr Osborne's family. This isn't commented upon at any point. What was she doing frankly!? Dialogue like "With great power comes great responsibility" and Parker's beleaguered description of why he likes MJ really does make one laugh and not I suspect intentionally. And have I touched on the completely unnecessary and ludicrous advertising of having Macy Gray just tacked in there...? ;-) Oh, yes and the ludicrous, hackneyed scenes with Cliff Robertson's Uncle Ben and the ultimatum offered by the Green Goblin - "The girl or the kiddies!!!!" My word, the "Green Goblin", eh? Seemed a rum sort of villain, having little or no specified aims other than to be a madman, torment Spiderman and perhaps - but it is left very vague - get back at a few businessman...! What of the scene where the scantily-attired Dunst is "accosted" by these men doing weird dog impressions...?! Reminded me of a scene with Bobby Briggs in the "Twin Peaks" pilot episode... Very odd tone here, with a rape very much implied. Some moments perhaps jarred a little, with the cartoon violence - perhaps itself questionable if this is targeted at younger audiences - all too numbing. The change in a late scene to realistic bloody violence just doesn't feel right somehow; both depictions of violence here have their problems and jar with each other. While as you can see, I have much to question in this film, I must emphasize that I did enjoy the damn thing. It's better thought out and has more of a modicum of intelligence about it than the "Blade II"s... Be wary of high expectations; this is hack work, and not always as well done as it could be, but it is at least fun to watch. Rating:- ***/*****
9.0~Excellent! smashattack Sign in Permalink Spoilers! Spiderman is a a breakthrough in the world of modern movies, yet it still maintains a traditional atmosphere which will appeal everyone. It's almost a perfect movie. First off, the casting is excellent. The actors are superb, putting on a realistic, extremely believable performance in their characters that they become real. The CGI, however, is only believable once Spidey puts on his traditional suit. When we see a CGI double of Maguire, it's kind of TOO smooth, yet it still fits in with its surroundings. The conflict between Spiderman and the Green Goblin is fantastic, absolutely brilliant. Good vs. Evil with a hint of Good, and young boy pitted against best friend's father is almost mind-boggling because so much emotion is involved, as well as suspense, intrigue, and mystery. My father, my brother and I went to see the movie today, the fifth of May, and my father was impressed. He told us how every morning he would go and get the paper so he could see Spiderman in the comics, and he would be excited to see the newest comic book. He then told us how nostalgic this movie was... it was so much like the comics. However, it was scientifically modernized, as in the explanations for superhuman powers was much, much better. It's no longer simply a radioactive spider (which I found somewhat hogwash anyway), now it's a "superspider" with spliced genes and a manipulated DNA and RNA. Danny Elfman proves to be a great composer yet again. With his recent work of Planet of the Apes, he just tops it off with another enthralling score that matches the movie and makes it that much more intense. His opening titles, as usual, is absolutely terrific. Spiderman is a classic clash of Good vs. Evil, The Right Choice vs. The Wrong Choice, and friend vs. friend. It is no longer just a comic strip... it is much, much more. It is a great movie that will thrill you (and keep you laughing as you sit on the edge of your seat) from start to finish. It is a must see.
10.0~anyone who doesn't love this film sucks nick-richie-eds Sign in Permalink this movie rocked. i love spiderman and i love this film. it was a good comic book movie. one of only a couple. and no i don't mean daredevil. this movie kicked ass and was fairly true to the comic (a must in a comic book based movie). just replace mary jane watson parker (in the movie) with gwen stacy (in the comic) and it all worked out fine. the special effects were great. web swinging looked fun! and i actually saw people leaving before the movie was over.
10.0~Marvel's emerging heroes.... Ic0n0clast2 Sign in Permalink Spiderman, action packed and thrilling, is a pleasure to see on the screen. Although the story seems slightly incomplete to the knowledged Marvel fan, the movie does manage to pack in a large amount of Peter Parker's past and history. Conforming to its original script (i.e. the tv show, the movie follows the Stan Lee plot wonderfully and delights the educated viewer. What really was great about this movie was the Spiderman flying/webslinging scenes through New York. The CGI is just spectacular plus the fighting manages to remain Spiderman-like, and doesn't try to rip off Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, or asian like martial art sequences (i.e. The Musketeer). The actors are believeable, with Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker and William Defoe as the menacing Green Goblin, each person , except for Bonesaw McGraw aka Randy "Machoman" Savage, belongs in their part. I would highly recommend any one to see this movie, it is a delight. In the future, I hope they will add more major and eviler villains such as Venom and Carnage. That would really spice things up! 9/10
10.0~A comic book movie done right. gates71 Sign in Permalink It does the heart good to see Marvel's characters finally getting the big screen respect that they deserve. No longer relegated to direct-to-video status, they have hit the big time and how. The secret? Getting great directors, scripts and actors. I don't believe any actor in Spider-man would be any fan's top choice for the role. But after seeing the movie it's hard to think of anyone who could do better. The story is faithful to the Spider-man mythos. Of course minor changes were made but they kept with the spirit of the comic book. And Raimi is obviously a Spidey fan. His love of the character show through in every scene.
8.0~Cheesy good fun. drawlife Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi's Spider-Man still holds a near and dear to my heart. This was the first film I watched in theaters in multiple viewings. Being eight years old and being a big comic-book fan, Spider-Man was a film that I could not wait to see. It's been almost twelve years since May 2002, and yet, the film still holds up in certain levels. I like the casting of Tobey Maguire. He brings out the best of Peter Parker and fits the title role very well. He holds the film on his shoulders but with also a good supporting cast. Willem Dafoe is great as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. I love how Dafoe is able to turn his Goblin persona on and off so effortlessly. He's very frightening and very cold, while at the same time can be a very nice man. James Franco is great as Harry Osborn, he doesn't overplay the wanting attention and support from his father, as well as displaying some jealousy towards his friend Peter, it's all very subtle and it works well. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson are excellent in their respective roles as Aunt May and Uncle Ben. J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson is spot on. Probably the best casting of a supporting comic-book character ever. Kirsten Dunst is, in a lack of a better word, just okay. Her delivery is solid in some moments, but it's near the end where she throws herself at Peter, admitting her love for him seemed very forced. It is the only uncomfortable scene to watch out of the whole film. The Visuals are decent in some shots, but overall, there are moments in the film where one could easily tell it was all CGI, and it's not that impressive. Costume of Spidey is very faithful and looks great on screen, I can't say the same for Goblin. It's very Power Rangers like. Spider-Man isn't an your typical summer action blockbuster. It is a blockbuster in every regard, but it has something more. The characters are relevant and I liked the whole dynamic between Norman favoring Peter over his own son Harry, whom he's disappointed in. It adds layers to the film and shows these character their reasons for doing what they're doing. The romance is cheesy, but it isn't too terrible, though Dunst isn't as strong as the other actors, she and Maguire have enough chemistry to buy into. Spider-Man is still very much an enjoyable film and swings high. 8.6/10
7.0~It deserves to exist! chernabog-25521 Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi had brought us a trilogy that everybody wanted, about a web-slinger climbing walls and fight crime. Yes, it's Spider-Man. He had made the first movie so great that I really was entertained when I watched this with my younger brother. It's just one of the Marvel Movies I could never forget. Tobey Maguire was just excellent and really perfect to be Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He was just a heart-felt character. He could even cry in the film (which most actors could do when they pretend that someone in their family is dead like Uncle Ben). The other casting choices were perfect as well like Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson, Peter's love interest, James Franco being Harry Osborn, son of Norman Osborn who is the Green Goblin, the main antagonist, played by Willem Dafoe. He was also one of the best performances making Green Goblin one of the greatest Marvel villains thanks to Dafoe. The performances were actually a lot better than I expected and all went really well. Flash Thompson played by Joe Manganiello, was a perfect bully in the film. He was just so naughty being Peter Parker's Draco Malfoy that made me wanna hit him in the face. There are so many memorable scenes which were quite hilarious like when Peter screamed :WHOAOAOAOAOAOAAAAA!" when he swung with his web over and hit himself on a wall. The wrestling scene was also hilarious. Bonesaw really looked like an idiot. The battle between Peter and Flash was the same, I laughed when Flash got kicked in the ass. I was surprised when Peter just shouted: "Shazam!". The screenplay was also good with some unforgettable lines, they were iconic like: "That's a cute outfit! Did your husband make it for you?". Some were funny, some were emotional and some were iconic. The dialogues and conversations were wonderful. There wasn't much CGI in this film which made the movie even better. There were webbing action sequences, epic battles and they used little CGI. I was a bit disappointed with the cinematography because it was like old-school like the 80s, 90s or maybe the 70s. I felt okay when this movie didn't have any black bars. It's just the first modern Spider-Man movie (I'm counting Nicholas Hammond as well but it's a Tv Series). The best part about this movie was Danny Elfman. When it comes to superheroes, Danny Elfman was the greatest one among the composers who could do that like Alan Silvestri but I felt Elfman was best in Spider-Man. The score was the best and I could never forget it. I even downloaded it on my MP3 player to listen when I'm having an adventure. Nobody could compose such a good superhero score like him. Of course, John Williams is still the best but he wasn't as good as Elfman in superheroes. This is one of the greatest Spider-Man movies. I felt like it deserved to exist, a high ratings from critics though IMDb users made it 7.3/10 which was really disappointing. Metacritic is also a disappointing movie rating website (another 73 points). Rotten Tomatoes gave it well, 90%, it deserved that. It had many things I needed and it's one of the greatest Marvel movie today. Ratings: 8.8/10
7.0~"Not so" Amazing Spider-Man incubrus Sign in Permalink The first half of the movie was very good. Why? Because Amazing Fantasy #15 was one of the greatest stories from a comic book and the movie adapted it very well. The other half of it was just as standard as other (comic book) movies . This is a bad sign for the next movie! 7 out of 10
8.0~Great! A must see. baseballfanjm Sign in Permalink A great start to the summer movie season. Unlike most action films, this one has a very good plot and characters that you actually care about. Of course, it is full of great action, SFX, and thrills. If there is a detraction, it is that some of the romantic scenes are a bit too mushy for my taste but they are really not much of a problem if you add it up to the rest of the movie. All in all, I vote this a 10/10. Now go and see this movie!
9.0~A comic book comes to life! deltadave669 Sign in Permalink This has to be the best adaptation of of a comic book super hero I've seen since Superman. While mucho kudos go all around for acting and storytelling, Raimi gets an extra helping in my book for this: The movie actually LOOKS like a comic book brought to life! Definifitely a worthwhile way to spend a couple hours and $10, and Episode II looks like it has a little stiff competition to face!
10.0~Had been caught in a web of low expectations... rongreelfilms Sign in Permalink Well, to be honest, I had been caught in a web of low expectations from the moment that I heard Peter Parker would be played by Toby Maguire. What a relief to see that his boyish qualities played into the role of Peter Parker so well! I loved watching as Peter Parker, with his newly found powers, swing from building to building in such an inexperienced quality to it. Arms and leg flailing, while screaming at the top of his lungs. All in all, I give Toby Maguire two thumbs up for the proportion of the character that he filled with such ease. Kirsten Dunst, a beautiful young actress who portrayed the never forgotten comic book character Mary Jane Watson, also did a superb job playing her character. I felt that with Toby Maguire playing Peter Parker, who I felt he did not resemble at all until I saw him acting the part, Kirsten Dunst can certainly pass as Mary Jane Watson, who I had originally felt also failed to resemble the character all that much. I now feel she played the role well and just hope that her character is not changed in the sequel, like in the majority of past movie sequels. William Dafoe, although seemingly old and withered, was the one actor who I knew would fill the shoes of Green Goblin with ease! Through great voices and great movement, this character was complete. There is always one problem with every character, though, and this did not deal with the actor at all. I was so thrilled to see Dafoe as Green Goblin due to the simple fact that I thought his face actually looked quite similar to how the comic book character would look in real life footage. The costume was simply horrendous, although it did work in with the character seeing how he worked in a company that revolved around science and mechanics, such as the hover board. Dafoe played the part with excellence. All of the characters, from J.K. Simmons role of J. Jonah Jameson to the mere part of the burglar played by Michael Papajohn, were remarkable through great acting, as well as great directing by Sam Raimi. SPOILER (in some aspects) - One last problem, in my opinion, is the simple fact that Harry Osborn, James Franco, now holds a severe grudge against Spider-Man! I pray to God that he is not going to be the next villain, yet if the next villain or any in the future are to be Harry Osborn, he should play the part! Never change actors in sequels no matter how small the part! Rob Ron gives this movie two big thumbs up! Big thumbs due to the simple fact that I was so into the movie I actually began sucking at them for the whole length of the movie...
8.0~Good...except for Maguire preppy-3 Sign in Permalink You probably know the story, so I'll skip a synopsis. The movie was fun--it moved quickly and had great special effects. I was almost always interested...but there are two big problems with this film: 1) Tobey Maguire--a horrible choice for Spider-Man. He's a good actor but he's so quiet and laid-back. Peter Parker/Spider-Man should be played by somebody with a lot of energy and more of a screen presence. I didn't believe him for one second. 2) The final battle between Spidey and the Green Goblin--WAY too violent for a PG-13 movie. I was disturbed by it--there was no need to get so graphic. However, I liked everything else. Kristen Dunst was pretty good as Mary Jane Watson and Willem Dafoe (as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin) and drop-dead handsome James Franco (as Harry Osborn) are excellent in their roles. There's a LOUD pounding score too and some excellent special effects (which work better on a big screen than on TV). Basically a good summer movie--if only they had cut down the violence and replaced Maguire.
7.0~Anyone reading this? kgprophet Sign in Permalink This movie will probably set a record for the number of reviews posted. So why waste your time reading mine? Ok, my review. I didn't follow Spidey too much when I was young. I was however, struck by how the whole story resembled Superman. I mean, sure, the comic books needed to follow certain staples on super-hero lore, but come on. (SPOILERS!!) - Cliff Robertson is a dead ringer for Glenn Ford in Superman, he even looks like him! - Peter goes to the big city and gets a job on the newspaper- hmmm, bump into Klark Kent working there? The editor spits out lines exactly like Jackie Cooper. -Peter gets all bent out of shape when his uncle/dad dies. Prompting him to use his powers to help the people he's close to. - As much as Peter loves his sweetheart, he eventually breaks it off to fight crime. - The Bad Guy kidnaps his sweetheart to lure him into a confrontation. - A big flying battle on the streets of Manhattan. Having said that, I did not have high expectations for yet another comic book hero movie. I was actually very pleased with the results. The movie provided a story that didn't try to rush through plot points. Although it very conveniently puts all the characters in the right place at them right time for the story to go where it does. Such as how the bad guy discovers the identity of Spiderman. One of the best things about the film is Tobey Maguire. He is pitch perfect as Peter, and has a good handle on the emotions. You can feel the anger build in him. I also applaud the screenplay for trying it's best to avoid the cliches, kudos to David Koepp. Even Sam Raimi, who is great with comic book imagery, shows more depth than any film he's ever done. He definitely knocks Tim Burton and his bad Batflicks out of the water. So I believe I am like the 547th person to post a review. I hope there is someone reading this. Most of the other reviews are like carbon copies with the same word, like "Awesome". My suggestion to you other guys, if you want to give some helpful advice about the movie you saw, find some other words to use besides 'good'. ("The story was good, the acting was good, the special effects were good, all in all a good film"). A review like that really has nothing to offer anyone else reading it. Get in touch with your feelings! Find something unique to say! 6 out of 10
10.0~Admirable leo_zingy Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is easily one of the best comics-to-screen adaptation ever. After the not-so-good attempts by Batman, Spawn (very underrated), X-Men and other superheroes (Superman did quite well), Spider-Man does, what no other has. It is an ultimate thrill-ride, with good computer generated scenes, the humor, the villain, the atmosphere and most of all - the action. All of it makes this movie a wonderful experience. Tobey Maguire is wonderful in the role of Peter Parker and with his sort-of "loser" character approaches everyone of us. When he becomes Spider-Man, everyone of us somehow does too. He relates to us, as he is shown completely human, troubled and has gone through great loss of his loved ones. His adapting to his strengths is very funny. His character is very-well developed, something, we could not say for the rest of the characters. Mary Jane was well portrayed by Kirsten Dunst, but her character lacked in depth. Her attraction towards Peter was baffling, as she hadn't noticed him for six years since they've moved next to him. The best character, however, is Harry Osborn (Willem Dafoe), who acts as a desperate man, who realizes that family is more important too late and is haunted by his dementia in the form of the Green Goblin. Great casting. All in all, the movie forms a much clearer message than its predecessors in superhero movies - with great power comes great responsibility. Compliments to Sam Raimi for this great portrayal of this great superhero. Highly recommended. Leo Zingy *****/*****
8.0~A good example for how to make a good comic book movie nickscheetz Sign in Permalink I was 2 years old when it was being announced that Spider-Man was going to be on the big screen, I didn't know who Spider-Man was, until I watched the movie when it came out on DVD. So what was the result of me watching it? I loved it. Sam Raimi himself is actually a comic book fan so he already knew what he had to do when he first directed this, he knew how to develop the characters and to match the original tone Spider-Man is supposed to be. First I will discuss what I like about the movie: I genuinely love the cast. Tobey Maguire is without a doubt one of the absolute best actors to play Peter Parker we've ever had, he has the soft nerdiness the character is supposed to have and it's very easy to care and sympathize with him in what he's going through, while I do agree he's not as good at being Spider-Man as he is with being Peter I still believe he does a fantastic job, he has funny one- liners and he was able to get ripped in order to look like how the character is supposed to look in the comics. I have absolutely no complaints with Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson, she's lovable, tough, sympathetic, and beautiful, what more could you ask for? I would've been shocked if James Franco said no to playing Harry Osborn, being that he's known for his work when it comes to comedy it must've been an interesting twist for him to play a more serious role, loyal, dedicated, intelligent, and sometimes delusional, Dane DeHaal should've learned from this before he agreed to star in The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson as Aunt May and Uncle Ben were perfect choices, they portrayed the characters the exact same way they were supposed to be portrayed in the comics and I have no problems whatsoever. Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin is perfect, Dafoe himself actually wanted the part and you can see how passionate he was when Raimi hired him, his overthetop expressive behavior in the movie is just how the Goblin is supposed to be in the comics and all the other relevant adaptations of him. If there were any cast members that I didn't know were in this and I ended up being surprised by what I discovered it would be Elizabeth Banks as Betty Brandt, there's not much to say about her other than she's kind, beautiful, and can't be replaced. Last but not least is none other than J.K Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, he's an over-bearing, obnoxious, loud mouth cartoon character in a live-action movie and there's never a boring scene that he's in, every single word that comes out of his loud, obnoxious, non-stop rambling, mouth of his is music to my ears! The camera work in this movie, while not spectacular by today's standards is still very cool to watch, whether it's any scene with spider-sense tingling, an intense action scene, or Spider- Man web slinging through the city. Spider-Man's suit is a very cool design and it stands out as being one of the most memorable Spider-Man costumes. The score composed by Danny Elfman is an absolute masterpiece, it's the overall best Spider-Man movie theme of all time, there is nothing that can top it. The change where Peter has organic web shooters instead of mechanical web shooters like in the comics is so much better because if you're bitten by a spider that gives you spider powers, why would you not be able to shoot webs from your wrists organically? Now for what I don't like about the movie: 1.Some of the c.g effects definitely haven't aged well, especially in the scene where Peter is testing his agility when jumping across a few rooftops. 2. The dialogue stinks, a lot of what the characters say comes out as being either shlocky, awkward, or just plain dumb, 2 examples include "it's you who's out Goblin, out of your mind" and "I think I have a superhero stalker." 3. The acting is extremely goofy, primarily with Willem Dafoe, his over the top behavior is very silly at times especially in the scene where he's talking to himself in the mirror and the scene where he talks to his Green Goblin mask when wondering how to kill Spider-Man. 4. Speaking of the Green Goblin's mask, his suit in this is just flat out ridiculous, the Green Goblin is one of the most expressive characters in comic book history, and they had the best actor to play him, but that's really hard to represent when you have him wearing a plastic mask with a frozen expression, thus he looks more like a Power Rangers character than he does as the Green Goblin. 5. This is the last complaint I have but unfortunately it's also the biggest problem I have with not just this movie but the entire series, the romance in this movie is HORRIBLE!!! The relationship between Peter and Mary Jane is so complicated that you'll be demanding the movie to just bring them together and let things stay that way so that you don't have to sit through how cringe worthy it is. In conclusion while the movie is definitely goofy by today's standards and is nowhere near perfect it's still a very clever and enjoyable adaptation of our favorite web-head. I may not love it as much as I used to when I was younger but it still makes me feel good every time I watch it. Because that's our gift, our curse, who are we? We're Spider-Man fans.
9.0~A great comic adaptation abstractthinker Sign in Permalink I saw this movie last night at a preview, and I must say I was impressed. The acting of all the cast was good, especially William Dafoe. I must admit that I wans't quite sure about Tobey Maguire as Peter Paker, but after watching it, I cannot think of anyone who would be better suited to the role. The only places where it changes the orginal comicbook story are when the comicbook is not very believable. So these changes don't harm the story in anyway, but might even make it better. On the whole, I would have to say this movie is definately worth seeing, especially if you are a fan of the comic/cartoon series or just a general comic fan.
7.0~Great visual style but disappointing movie. Boba_Fett1138 Sign in Permalink The movie tries to be more than just a superhero movie. It tries to give the characters and the story more depth and emotions just like in Sam Raimi's other 'superhero' movie "Darkman", it didn't impressed me. At least "Darkman" still had some fun moments and characters. "Spider-Man" is a movie that looks great from the outside but is empty and shallow on the inside. There is nothing wrong with the casting in this movie. Tobey Maguire is a perfect nerdy Peter Parker and James Franco is equally good as Harry Osborn. The relation between Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson is nicely done thanks to the chemistry between Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst. Rosemary Harris and J.K. Simmons are also examples of some good casting. The villain however is disappointing. Willem Dafoe is a good actor but he is overacting too much in this movie. His shiny Green Goblin costume looks also very laughable, especially his mask that can't move at all, with as a result that he looks like a "Power Ranger" villain. Not only his mask looks "Power Ranger" like, also some of the action which I also found a disappointing aspect in the movie. The final showdown is also a disappointment and contains one very cheesy scene involving some New Yorkers on a bridge... Danny Elfman's music stands good on it's own but doesn't really fit the movie since there is no real 'superhero' theme like "Batman" or "Superman" had. Still "Spider-Man" is kind of a cool movie. Nothing beats seeing Spidey swinging through the streets of New York. The movie is still good as pure entertainment, a real popcorn flick if you like. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/
6.0~It's a good job Peter Paker isn't afraid of heights... Almost great but not quite. poolandrews Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is set in New York where nerdy high school student Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) lives with his aunt May (Rosemary Harris) & uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), while on a school field trip to the research laboratories at Columbia University he is bitten by a genetically engineered spider. Over the next few days Peter undergoes an amazing transformation, he gets stronger, develops the ability to climb sheer walls & shoot thick webbing from his wrists. Peter has turned into a spider-man, the physical appearance of a man but with the strength, agility & web shooting powers of an ordinary spider. However tragedy strikes & uncle Ben is killed by a thief, from that moment on Peter decides to use his amazing spider like powers to fight crime in New York. Calling himself Spider-Man Peter's first big test comes in the form of the evil Green Goblin... Directed by Sam Raimi this was the first time the hugely popular Spider-Man superhero comic book character appeared in a film despite having featured in various cartoon & live action TV show's, a huge box-office hit when originally released back in May 2002 in US theatres I actually remember going to see it when it was released here in the UK a month later in June & I specifically remember not liking it that much. Having watched it again last night for the first time in over 5 years I actually enjoyed it a lot more but I still didn't think it was the 100% solid gold classic many make it out to be. The script by David Koepp tries to have it's cake & eat it, it tries to present a very serious world where Peter Parker has all the usual teenage trouble with girls, bullies & family in some really rather dull & dour drama yet at any given moment it can shift into over-the-top fantasy comic book mode with Spider-Man swinging between New York skyscrapers & the Green Goblin flying around on his glider. I personally thought the transition between the two at times is quite jarring & badly handled & I just often thought the serious drama & the fantasy comic book action didn't sit that well together. At a good 2 hours in length I also felt there wasn't really enough story here & it could have used a bit of editing to quicken the pace up. Then there's the Green Goblin, was anyone else throughly disappointed by him? In the comic books & cartoon series the Green Goblin is just that, a green creature rather than a guy in a green outfit & silly mask. Also what was the Green Goblin's ultimate plan? I mean I know he killed the board members so Norman could take complete control of the company but what was his purpose after that? Did he have any more plans? I don't think so, he just seemed 'there' for Spider-Man to fight but why? To me the Green Goblin after he had killed the board members seemed like a totally pointless & motiveless character. Director Raimi has fun, there are some truly outstanding CGI computer effects & action scenes. The end in particular is impressive as is the fight between the Green Goblin & Spider-Man in a burning building, the shots of Spider-Man swinging through the streets of New York are majestic & look most impressive. However there is one goof that I noticed the first time I saw it, it's a shot present in the trailer & it really annoyed me last night as well, there's a scene when Spider-Man rescues Mary Jane from the collapsing balcony & she is holding onto him while he swings across the street. Well, if you look at the shot they are swinging from left to right but her hair is blowing to the right when it should be blowing to the left, it's like standing in front of a wind machine & your hair blowing in the direction the wind is coming from. The Spider-Man costume looks really good actually, several were made & they apparently cost $100,000 each. The film has some stylish moments & is fun to look at during the fantasy action sequences but not so much during the drama scenes. With a budget of about $100,000,000 with another $30,000,000 on top of that for advertising Spider-Man was a well funded film & it comes as no surprise the production design, sets & special effects are superb. Although set in New York it was largely filmed in Los Angeles. The acting is OK but no-one stood out as being great, even Maguire wasn't anything special although Willem Dafoe puts in quite a good performance. Nominated for two Oscars, Best Sound & Best Visual Effects, it ended up winning neither. Spider-Man is almost a great film, not many comic strips make good films but Spider-Man nearly pulls it off, a slightly slow pace, a disappointing villain & some slushy sentimental drama stop it from achieving greatness. Definitely a god film worth a watch but it's not the flawless piece of film-making many make it out to be. To date this has been followed by a further three sequels, Spider-Man 2 (2004), Spider-Man 3 (2007) & Spider-Man 4 (2009) which is currently in production.
10.0~True to form tomrito Sign in Permalink Good movie. This has a little for everyone. For anyone who does not know who spider-man is this movie will let them know every thing they need to know. It crosses the line and lets all us spider freaks get our kicks and gives a good story to everyone else. The thing about this movie is that they made a really good movie, not a great spider-man comic, but a really good movie. Great acting, great character development and a good love story. Don't listen to any of the nit pickers, As far as good entertainment goes, this movie is the best so far this year, hands down. As far as the real spider-man, the only time we see him is at the end of the last fight scene when spider-man is giving it to the green goblin and you can finally see spider-man in the face of Mr.Maguire. For Mr. Maguire to really work as spider-man he has to keep developing from that scene. It was a good all around movie and can stand alone as one of the best movies made. But if you really want to keep this going you will have to make Mr. Maguire develop into a real spider-man, no longer the wimp teenager full of questions, but a real super-hero. The question is, is Mr. Maguire up to being the real spider-man?
10.0~With great power comes great film vakarisvakariene-1 Sign in Permalink This film is totally perfect I love how Sam raimi put balance between action with spidey and peters normal life... Its a great film for all family so buy this DVD, sit on sofa with Ur family and enjoy it! The spider-man teaches us something important every time and I rate this film 10 because it has balanced all the styles of movies I like: Action and adventure, comedy, romance and much more I recommend you to watch it right now! See other spider-man films too I hope that there will be fourth and further more... It has many Oscars and rewards if u don't believe trust the spider-fans all around the wide world! Superior film with superior crew!!!!
9.0~Spidey rules New York and the world stamper Sign in Permalink It had been a long time since I had seen something of my beloved superhero Spiderman. I'd grown to love the Spider man TV, but I quit watching it, after I'd seen them all twice or so. I then later saw, that they were still making new ones, but I have to say, I'd kind of grown out of animated series. I never started do dislike the animated show, but you kind of grow out of all TV shows, because they run for much too long. This even happens when you love the show. You just can't help it. And after a while you start forgetting about your once loved ones' and you turn your head to new things. Yesterday I turned my head to a new old thing'. I turned my head to the Spider Man movie. This movie was supposed to be big. It had made about 750 million at the Boxoffice and it was listed among the best 250 movies at IMDB, but still I had my doubts. Why you ask? Well, I'd seen some of the music video's and they gave me the impression that the effects were really bad and that the film would be like Blade, a two hour music video. How wrong was I? First of all, none of the songs from the Spider Man Soundtrack are featured in the film, like it is done in the Blade films. The songs can be heard in the background, playing on a radio or so. Second of all, although the effects were bad, I did not mind a bit, since the movie was so awesome, that I did not even notice most of the time. What was great about the movie, you might ask? Well I can tell you what was not in a nutshell: the effects. The rest was pure genius and truly inspired by the comics and the animated series. First of all I have to give credit to the casting bureau. All of the parts were casted really well. Everyone fit in like a glove. Then credits of course go to the director (Sam Raimi) and the cast. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) came over as a real big nerd (even worse than I remember him in the animated series), M.J. Watson (Kirsten Dunst) was very gorgeous, charming and likeable and Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe) was really great as well. The scene, when he's talking to himself in the mirror was really great. The grimaces he made, from one shot to the next, were really awesome. The director must also be credited, for bringing everything fabulously to the screen. I mean, there was nothing really innovative about it, but he was very solid and knew exactly what he needed and wanted. Last but not least I think I owe my thanks to the writers and to Danny Elfman. The writers of this film really succeeded in making up a story and dialogue in the film, that capture the figure that is Spider Man. He is a boy, who could be me (if he looked different). He was very human, a bit shy around magnificent beautiful women, a bit of a loner but basically a very nice guy. Then he gets to have extraordinary power. What is he to do? What will he become? What will happen to his loved ones? Throughout the film we observe the evolution of Peter Parker to become Spider Man. We see what power his new found strength brings and what responsibility. We see his powers upside, but also it's downside. So despite Peter Parkers nonhuman strength he remains a very human and normal figure which the viewer can relate to and that is what makes Spider Man such a great comic figure. A very big thanks to everyone involved for giving me the best two cinematic hours in a long time. 9 out of 10
9.0~This is what all Superhero movies should be like !!! MyLightie Sign in Permalink When talks of a Spider-Man movie to be released in 2002 surfaced, I was really excited since I loved the comics and the animated series. I was also skeptical since many superhero comic-book movies are not as good as expected. At first I was worried how they would fit the whole story in the film without being too long and boring. Luckily everything was handled very well - all credit to the crew. The film gets right into it - with Peter Parker being bitten in the first fifteen or so minutes of the film. From there everything unfolds brilliantly. Tobey Maguire was well cast as the friendly neighbourhood wall crawler, Willem Dafoe was (as always) brilliant in his part as the Green Goblin, Kirsten Dunst made an ideal Mary Jane Watson, so did James Franco as the rich bratty Harry Osborne and not forgetting J.K Simmons as the Grumpy and Feisty J Jonah Jameson. Many people were quick to point out the flaws, but that is just plain stupid. If you going to film looking for flaws you will obviously find them - no film is perfect. If there were if a few things that should have been criticized, one would be the Green Goblins gawky mask and the other would be the fact that spidey's "spider sense" could have been better, and more widely used throughout the film. *I personally hoped that the World Trade Center would have been included but I understand why it was not* I must say that I thought Spider-Man was fantastic. The cast was perfect, the plot was excellent and very true to the comic, and the film entertaining. Sam Raimi's direction was crisp and well rolled out. The script was as good as it could be, and the score was marvelous. From now on, when people talk about brilliant superhero movies, forget Superman, Batman, Spawn, Blade and X-Men - SPIDER-MAN IS DEFINITELY THE BEST.
9.0~An awesome picture, damn near perfect thefinisher_23 Sign in Permalink This is the film that will forever be credited with the revamping of the superhero industry, and definitely deserves that merit. It's a superhero movie at the finest level with motivated characters soaring action sequences and truly devious Nemesis. Let me just say that Tobey Maguire was the perfect casting choice for Peter Parker. For better or for worse he will probably always be remembered as Spider-Man and that because by the series second installment he had totally immersed himself in the role and you did realize it was him anymore you just saw Peter. Im not a Kristen Dunst fan at all but she did give a great performance in this. James Franco used this to establish himself as a very solid convincing actor. Then there's Willem Dafoe who truly is a great actor and is consistently underrated. He played such a great villain helpless, lost, and a borderline weak person as Norman Osborne. When he becomes the goblin he's a wise cracking, evil, motivated and powerful killer. Kudos also go to Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris, and J.K. Simmons for playing their roles true, entertaining and in Simmons case funny. The plot was great because it felt like you were watching a comic-book film which made it fun and involving. I never read the comics but they seemed to stay true to the source material. It's also never cheesy or under-developed which is essential to a superhero film. I loved this movie, it's timeless, fun and overall a fantastic achievement
6.0~Forget it! twsmith Sign in Permalink Formulaic storyline, familiar story-board of an action movie, average soundtrack and indecision about whether to be serious or slightly tongue in-cheek with the characters. (Although Kirsten Dunst is a fox - so her character is excepted) What exactly distinguishes this movie for it to merit anything higher than 6? Try watching it before rating it. Eminently forgettable - doesn't come near Batman or Superman. Will avoid the inevitable sequel.
7.0~Maybe the best comic-book based film. ChoiceCuts Sign in Permalink ***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** A couple of years ago, to say that a movie was "a great comic-based film" was a bit like saying "George Bush is the worlds keeper of peace". Luckily things have changed, X-men, Hulk and others have improved the genre a lot and spider-man just might be the best of them and the only films that I think can compete with Spider-man are those classic japanese Lone-wolf samurai movies. A good cast including the fitting Tobey Maguire as Pete Parker, the extrordinary beautiful and talented Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson and an, as always, fantastic Willem Dafoe as the bad guy, Green Goblin, at least makes this the most well-played comic-movie. Sam Raimi has succeeded in making the characters believieble, it's not your ordinary, dumbed down super heroes and villains you'll meet here, there's a dark atmosphere captured within the movie and not the happy-happy-joy-joy feeling some might have hoped for. The good effects also helps this movie. Overall this is a interesting and entertaining movie wich succeeds in bringing our beloved spidery hero to the big screen. It's not without it's faults though, I felt that the ending was somewhat of an anti-climax and some other parts felt a bit unnecessary. A sequel will soon be at hand, and I hope that it's at least as good as this one. 7/10
10.0~Go see this, you will not be disappointed! jdarryls Sign in Permalink What can I say! This movie was more then excellent! I got to see it at the first showing on opening day here in my city of Sarnia, and frankly I was dazzled. Toby my man, were stellar! As for the rest of the casting you were amazing. The effects used in this production were very definitely "special effects". It continues to amaze me how year and year again Hollywood pulls this kind of magic off. I was already a big fan of Spiderman since I was a kid, but Toby (who was already in my good books for being a strict vegetarian like myself), you can definitely add me to your fan base. Way to go everyone, I can't wait until the next one! Then then.....
1.0~what responsibility? fellattiouk Sign in Permalink For the first thirty minutes the movie was great, depicting the scene of the school 'geek' turn super hero learning how to use his new found powers. But I feel the so called responsibility was too much for the hero and the rest of the movie was highly predictable. The arch enemy 'green goblin' felt like a villain from the 'power rangers' and no satisfying climax was reached. In comparison with the first 'Batman' movie which conveyed the reality of savior and the mysterious path which the hero took was far more entertaining. I sincerely hope the next installment or the spiderman meets superman spin off can take the super hero genre to the next level.
8.0~One of the most ecstatic superhero events in quite some time StevePulaski Sign in Permalink Peter Parker is the awkward, neurotic, socially inept teenager, interested in photography, and crushing on the prettiest girl in school, Mary Jane Watson. During his trip to a genetics laboratory, where the class learns all about genetically altered spiders, Peter is bit on the hand by one of the arachnids that escaped and slowly begins to possess powers beyond his wildest dreams. At first, he realizes he can see without the help of his glasses, next, he notices he can leap heights and flip to great lengths, and finally, he starts to acquire the ability to stick to walls and shoot webs out of his hands. He becomes the notorious and infamous, Spider-Man, where he has proved to be a burden to some, but a hero to others in his hometown of New York City, where he lives with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris). After his Uncle Ben is shot and killed during a robbery, Peter notices the city is nothing but scum and is determined to take down the cities' worst in the form of secrecy. Meanwhile, his close friend, Harry's (James Franco) father, Dr. Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) is the president of the Oscorp manufacturing corporation, where they make and supply weaponry to the United States Army. In the mix of it all, Osborn becomes, what newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) dubs, the "Green Goblin" who pilots a glider, and serves as the villain to Spider-Man's hero. What inevitably follows is a series of unplanned and very physical battle scenes taking place with the backdrop of New York City skylines to handle it all. There's also a subplot, involving Peter, played effortlessly well by Tobey Maguire, trying to impress Mary Jane, played by the talented and attractive Kirsten Dunst, by relentlessly saving her from calamity and trouble by sweeping in at the nick-of-time while she is either being held captive by the Goblin, intimidated by muggers or even falling to her death. The catch is Mary Jane doesn't know this is Peter, but on the side, she talks to him at various points in the film. They've lived next to each other for years, but Peter has always viewed her as the unachievable girl next door and Mary Jane has probably always found Peter to be the unfortunate geek next door. How she doesn't recognize his voice when "Spider-Man" saves her an astronomical three times is beyond me. She should probably stick to staying in doors. No bother. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man is a fascinating and entertaining work of superhero fiction, collectively doing Marvel and all of its actors justice by blessing them with good material, a straight-shooting script, and action sequences that don't fail to impress. The kinetics and craft of it all are through the roof, and the twenty-five+ years the picture spent in development clearly was for the best. The film spends the first hour or so getting us acquainted with the man behind the mask, much like the original Marvel comics. We see Parker as a human, not an action figure, occupying a mask of uniqueness and power. The film shows the geek in the beginning, sympathetically, and then goes on to showcase him powerfully, where he is a placed in a role of certainty and bravery. Marvel comics were notorious for paying attention to the character behind the mask and the character in the mask. One thing Spider-Man neglects to showcase in its script and its main character is the agony and pain of it all. The second Marvel feature in 2003, Ang Lee's unfairly bashed Hulk, did a much better job at showing how a superhero's powers were more of a belligerent curse than a stroke of luck in a world of bitterness. Stan Lee infused his comics with so much life and enigma for the characters, plot progression, and the color of it all that the challenge to adapt it to film is definitely there. Raimi handles it appropriately and maturely, not becoming sidetracked with monotonous melodrama or overly-cutesy action sequences. The ones he does bring to the table are kinetic and stylish, showing off some of the most impressive photography and visual work of the year 2002, and brings two charismatic actors along for the ride. Spider-Man may not have the excruciating depth of Hulk, which created more cons than pros in the job of a superhero, along with establishing a sincere yet distant father and son relationship, but in its own right, it does so much in its two hours that you may need to stop for a breather. Starring: Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris, and J. K. Simmons. Directed by: Sam Raimi.
10.0~Just one word: awesome! pokalei Sign in Permalink I never read the comic books on Spider-Man, but I know that I'll definitly go back several times to see that movie, it was good! I think the storyline was well plot out, and the people casted in the movie were well selected. ^_^
10.0~The best superhero movie since Batman. JohnLennon1985 Sign in Permalink This movie was incredibly hyped up, then put off for some time due to some sensitive material, to be hyped up again. This movie didn't let me down. Tobey Maguire fit the part very well. He just had the look. I am in love with Kirsten Dunst, so there was no doubt in my mind that she was going to do great. Willem Defoe even made Speed 2 exciting, so again, there were no doubts. Danny Elfman may have ripped himself off for the soundtrack, but it still wasn't bad. Spider-man is one of our most recent classics. 10/10. This is our gift... our curse...
10.0~Stand's proudly next to Christopher Reeve's Superman movie's and Smallville starring Tom Welling. zach-69 Sign in Permalink First off I have to say that I am a Spider-Man fanatic and know-it-all. I've grown up with Spider-Man being my favorite Hero, pajama's, comics, posters, watched the 90's cartoons. I know Spidey like the back of my hand. The film and it's sequel and that ones sequel are true to the comics. Best acting since Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, and Gene Hackman in the Superman Movies. Tobey Maguire brought Peter Parker and Spider-Man to life (ignore the CG.) He was hysterically funny, straight out of the comics. Kirsten Dunst (my favorite actress) brought my favorite character Mary Jane Watson to the big screen with a bang! She was the perfect actress for that role. She portrayed MJ straight from the comics. Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin was sweeet! He pulled off Norman and the Goblins evil so stinking well, better than Kevin Spacey in Superman Returns. Willem stands proudly next to Gene Hackman (Lex Luthor in Christopher Reeve's Superman Movies.) I would give Tobey, Kirsten, and Willem all grammys and take them out to dinner. It is a must see! Spider-Man 3 will be out on May 4, 2007! Bryce Dallas Howard is going to be playing Peter's second girlfriend Gwen Stacy, his first in the originals was Betty Brant. Personally, for me, after watching it at least twelve times, Tobey and Kirsten stole the show. I love how he brought out Peter. Mary Jane is Kirsten's best role, I love her!!! Spidey 3 will be out on May 4,2007. Rock on Kiki! (Her nickname.)
10.0~Very Good milescorn Sign in Permalink No other Spider-Man film has every been this good, great cast, good plot, and they could have not picked a better actor to play the bad guy. All in all it was the best super hero film I have ever seen, if you like these kind of films, then see it.
3.0~So bad I don't know where to begin. mikesmith-11 Sign in Permalink This movie is awful. I walked out of this film felling like I was lobotomized. My jaw was dropped and I couldn't utter a word. I went in expecting a good movie. I mean it's Spider-Man for crying out loud. But the hack job that is this movie just blew my mind. Why would the director make this movie like this. Did he have to inject so many campy, comic book traits into the film. It just made the movie silly. I felt like I was watching the 60's Batman TV show except it's about Spider-man and it's updated with 21st century sets and special effects. This film should be a lessen in how not to do a superhero movie. Stay away from this movie.
2.0~How Could Such a Bad Film Make so Much Money? the-evil-cult Sign in Permalink The film starts off well, but then after a while the characters become both boring and annoying. The special effects are fake and overdone. I rolled my eyes so often at the badly executed romance and overall corniness of the movie. 2/10
6.0~The First Part's well done, The second one is crap. kademil Sign in Permalink It's incredible how Americans have tranformed an art in some kind of a business. The first part (story settling) is really impressive but once it's done, the movie goes straight away to ridiculous sweet feelings that not cope with the comic highlines, by that i mean that the second part is more an american drama (which always end goods indeed) than a cinematographic representation of the comic.
10.0~Wow. dairyuh Sign in Permalink I cannot even begin to rave about this movie without sounding like I am exaggerating. I am not. It is honestly the best movie I have ever seen. I have to go see it again because I want to find all the little inside spidey jokes. Thank you, Sam Raimi, thank you.
9.0~Take Me With You, Spider Man Abby-9 Sign in Permalink Entering a skeptic, a Spidy lover like billions of others from long time past, asking "How will they do it?" First, they will make sure it has a clear MARVEL imprimatur. Then, they will segue from past comix films with an enrapturing not-unfamiliar-type film score that takes you from the printed page into the wild universes of your imagination. Then, they will create web-swinging on the big screen--but you get into that gently, and i have to say the red and blue spider is a totally cool arachnid, its bite didn't look THAT bad--hey reality is just a sticky hair's breadth from the world of major fantasy mayhem. Can't say it all at once, it's too overpowering. But will note that Willem Dafoe lit up like i didn't think he could. And Toby McG. shot off bolts of personal energy like i didn't think he could. All the actors were their comix people, and it's a magical ensemble that deserves mega-credit for their work. Editors get credit, too. The film kind. (Jonah Jameson is hot, by the way. A real beast.) So . . . while i'm not going back to the theatre on a daily basis, i will go back soon for another look-see.
9.0~A quieter comic book adaptation Lego_Darth Sign in Permalink What makes this movie special is the personal touch. There is no big "let's destroy the world" plot, it's just a grudge match between two polar opposites with superpowers. Willem Dafoe gives a brilliant and creepy performance as the Green Goblin, really the best villain in the Spiderman comics, and Tobey Macguire knocks it out of the ball park, pardon the pun, with his performance as Peter Parker. Really, this movie isn't about solving some global crisis, like in Singer's X-Men flicks, but is about simply doing the right thing. That's what gives this movie such a great feeling. People don't really remember the springy high-flying fun of the webslinging so much as the personal story. And, one especially interesting aspect of this film is the almost invisible direction and cinematography. Sam Raemi has an invisible direction style that makes everything seem more real as opposed to staged. The cinematography never calls attention to itself so you're never left feeling detached from the story or characters. It, Spiderman, is an impressive and singularly brilliant achievement.
9.0~Well executed, with heart and soul. See it. Perret Sign in Permalink I was positively surprised by this movie. Never mind deviations from the original comic (I didn't mind any of them) or not completely realistic FX (worked well enough for me); this movie captures the spirit of the comic quite successfully. It's fun and cool, but also borders on the romantic and even slightly tragic. See it :)
5.0~don't bother neomuzic Sign in Permalink If you read the comic books, if you watched the tv shows and cartoons.. Don't bother with this crap. It has a bad short story that was lengthened to far. The acting was bad also. If you must see it, see it in the afternoon to save money.
10.0~Reinvents how CGI does action. Tesarta Sign in Permalink The only weak part of this film was the ham-handed romantic dialogue, delivered in rather flat affect (mainly by Dunst). Blame this on Koepp, I suppose. This weakness, however, is more than made up for by the incredible CGI work. It is not flawless in quality (certainly Star Wars will do better), but it is flawless in energy, concept and sheer fun. Spider-Man moves with such grace and speed and he is light in the air just as he should be (and if Roger Ebert didn't like the weightlessness, then clearly he's never read the comic book). Spider-Man makes New York City look fun. The final scene alone, ending atop the flagpole, was worth the price of admission.
1.0~Needs to be cut by about 1 hr., 45 mins. Steamliner Sign in Permalink If this latest in a string of recent awful super heroe movies [after 'Batman and Robin'] were a short subject film instead of a full-length feature, it really might've been something. The last 15 minutes finally get it together for what passes as a movie experience. Until then, however, this film is pretty much a letdown, padding its material in a blur of camerawork apparently intended to hide how thin it is. In one of his less-than-stellar performances, Tobey McGuire portrays the geeky Peter Parker, who develops super human powers after being bitten by a radioactive spider. Kirsten Dunst and Wilem Defoe were more convincing in their roles as Parker's/Spiderman's love interest and arch-memesis respectively. Sam Raimi directed this unbelievably slow and drawn-out film in which scenes begin and end with nothing having been communicated. This is just too bad, because it's not the actors' fault. Laughably predictable and cliched, there are no mysteries about Spiderman, other than the one of how a film this bad can end up costing so much money to make.
7.0~Here comes the Spider-Man! DavidSim240183 Sign in Permalink Although a huge Spider-Man fan, I must confess I've never read a single Spider-Man comic. Everything I know about the character comes from the cartoons. First the classic one with that song. Then the updated one from the 90's which took a more adult stance, and allowed us to get behind the masks and see the people inside. And now finally, Spider-Man gets the big budget treatment, given a distinctly absurdist spin by one of my favourite directors, Sam Raimi. Sam Raimi is a self-professed Spidey fan, and his enthusiasm for the character shines through warm and bright. Raimi has taken care to ensure the emotional core that always drew people to Spidey in the first place is still intact. The story begins on the day Peter Parker is changed into Spider-Man. Parker is a gawky teenager who lives with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. He pines for the girl next door, Mary-Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). He's friends with super rich Harry Osborn, the son of industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe). When Parker goes on a field trip to Columbia State University, he gets bitten by a radioactive spider, and is thus transformed. He can now shoot webbing from his wrists, he has superhuman strength and agility, and he can stick to walls. At the same time, Norman Osborn goes through a transformation of his own. Pressured by his superiors to perfect a new type of super suit, the experiment goes wrong (the film is admittedly a bit vague on this point) and Osborn is driven insane. With the new suit and a hi-tech glider, he becomes the Green Goblin, and sets out to grab power. Meanwhile, Peter's new-found abilities go to his head. He beats up the school bully, and gets off on the adrenaline rush. He feels he can now win the heart of Mary-Jane, but first he needs cash. He goes into wrestling, and there's a great scene where we see Peter try out new designs for an outfit. I got a genuine feeling of exhilaration when I saw the final Spider-Man suit. But Peter's odd behaviour hasn't gone unnoticed by Aunt May and Uncle Ben. In a very poignant scene, Ben tries to teach Peter about the dangers of power. Thankfully we still get the classic line "With great power, comes great responsibility." But Peter doesn't want to listen. When Peter goes into the wrestling ring, he comes out a winner. The wrestling promoter doesn't give him the money he wants, and is then robbed. But Peter makes no effort to stop him. Just for the sake of revenge. Peter's power trip has sent him sky high. And comes crashing down to Earth. Uncle Ben is killed, and in a fit of rage, Peter wants vengeance. Only to find the murderer is the same man who robbed the promoter. The man Peter let go. A man who ends up dead after going through a window. A man Peter doesn't try to save. Filled with remorse, Peter takes Ben's words of wisdom to heart, and puts his powers to good use. As the amazing Spider-Man. One thing that struck me about Spider-Man was how aptly cast it was. Tobey Maguire is pitch perfect as Peter Parker, finding the right amount of shy awkwardness and balancing it with teenage angst. But unfortunately, he seems a little lost in the Spidey suit. He never really comes alive. Kirsten Dunst is a fine actress most of the time, but spends half of it screaming as Mary-Jane. When she's not though, she makes an impression, displaying a touching vulnerability when her acting career goes nowhere. Willem Dafoe is suitably manic, but we never really get behind the Green Goblin's mask. Sam Raimi explored this territory to far greater effect in his earlier effort Darkman. Dafoe goes rather over the top, and his performance falls into cliché. Still, there are some scenes involving the Green Goblin's psychosis I liked, such as the supremely eerie scene when Norman argues with himself in a mirror. James Franco is an insipid Harry Osborn. He walks around the film with a tortured puppy dog look that is very irritating. He is definitely the most shallow character in the film, and if truth be told, contributes nothing. Cliff Roberts and Rosemary Harris are great as Uncle Ben and Aunt May. There is a lot of warmth to their characters, and they're utterly believable. But who could forget J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. He is 100% spot on in the part. Capturing everything. The mannerisms. Gruff voice. Temper tantrums. You perk up every time he's on the scene. It's just a pity he doesn't get more to do. Honestly though, Spider-Man is a little disappointing. It doesn't quite fire on all cylinders. The components for a great film are all there, but somehow it doesn't add up to a satisfying whole. The first half is effective as Peter comes to terms with what he's become, but as the special effects take over, the human element gets lost in the crowd. Some of the action scenes are unimpressive, and the latter half is not as compelling as it should be. When I first saw Spider-Man, I loved it because it was gratifying to see things following the path of the cartoons. But after watching it several times, I now realise it is a rather flawed film, marred by a disappointing climax. Personally, I prefer Spider-Man 2. It is a far superior film, because it is much more well rounded, and makes better use of it's characters. It also irons out the flaws the original had. Spider-Man is perfectly watchable, but it's not up there with Superman or Batman. A good film, but not a great one. Although the classic song on the end credits was a nice touch!
8.0~Here comes the Spider-Man !!! KrazzyDJ Sign in Permalink Fresh and Energetic. If I were to describe this movie in two words, the aforementioned ones would be it. Right from the first scene itself, you feel as if you've been sucked into the world of high school student Peter Parker. And you realize that it's not as bright and nice as it should've been. The movie serves as an origin story to Spider-Man. It shows the transition of Peter Parker from a nerdy, butt-of-all-jokes high school student, to a slightly more confident and arrogant personality to, eventually, a responsible superhero in the form of Spider-Man. No point in discussing the plot here as its fairly predictable and spilling the beans here itself would make it more so. Sam Raimi's direction is excellent and the movie is a thrill ride from start to end. The performances are utterly convincing. Hats off to Tobey Maguire, after viewing this movie, I'd be hard-pressed to recommend any alternative for the role of Peter-Parker / Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst is also convincing as Mary Jane Watson - the next door neighbor and childhood crush of Parker. So is Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborne - the businessman who later on, after experimenting with a performance enhancing drug in a laboratory, turns into his alter ego, the Green Goblin. And so are the others. The film is great technically as well with its brilliant cinematography which has the camera swooping up and down buildings and New York streets at a breathtaking speed. The art design is also great and has been used appropriately to handle and provide us with some memorable sequences (special mention goes to the Unity Fair sequence at Times Square). The visual effects, while good, are something which I found below par at times (again note some of the shots of the Goblin at the Unity Fair sequence; it's clearly evident that there's some mixing and matching being done here). Maybe this was because of the color schemes of the lead characters because of which they had to be shot separately which may have been responsible for this. Danny Elfman's music is also very good; the best piece being the opening theme. What is so endearing about the movie that it has a heart and soul of its own. It becomes clearly evident while watching the movie that the makers of the movie are extremely passionate about Spider-Man. And that passion is visible in every frame of the movie - be it the action sequences, the characterizations or otherwise. It has become difficult for me to imagine another team behind the future installments of this movie. Before viewing this movie, I only knew about Spider-Man from some of the cartoon shows that used to appear on Television about him. Now, after seeing this movie, not only has my interest in Spider-Man sky-rocketed, but I consider him to be the most intelligent and the best superhero amongst the lot of fictional superheroes. Fantastic stuff.
10.0~AWESOME chastity779 Sign in Permalink This movie was so awesome! I was pleasantly surprised. Ever since I heard who was going to play Spiderman I thought it might not turn out that great. I was picturing the Tobey Maguire I saw in The Cider House Rules and Pleasantville, and it just didn't seem like it would work...but oh how it did. He was a great Spiderman, I don't think anyone could have done the job as well. I love movies and I see a lot of them, but this one is a stand out. I almost want to see it again bad enough to pay another eight bucks. Also, Kirsten Dunst was really cool, as usual, as M.J. I just hope that the sequal is anywhere near as good as this one. I can't wait!!!
1.0~Absolutely Crap Smoochy Sign in Permalink what the hell was that, this movie has to be the worst movie i have ever seen, the phony acting and bad guys costume (what this is power ranger costumes now) seriously people this is a terrible movie and is not worth the money to go see. to the director and produces the movie sucked, get a life, learn how to make a movie not something you pulled out of the trash can. very disappointing
1.0~Are you serious? halfblaked Sign in Permalink Being a big spiderman fan, i was expecting one of the greatest super hero movies ever. Boy was i dissapointed. I can honestly say that this was the most dissapointing movie of all time. First of all, during the movie, i kept telling myself that this was a "comic book" movie, and that the dialouge would be pretty bad. I just kept telling myself that, and I can only tolerate so much. But oh my god, there are so many dumb lines, I can't even explain. Most of them are cliched, which doesnt bother me too much.... its a comic book movie. But its amazing how many stupid things that were squeezed into the script. My other complaint was the wrestling thing... with his costume. If he had just appeared with his sleek, tight, spider man costume than that would of been cool... but instead they stress that he cant do that and make him wear that stupid nike clothes, and like a freeking ski mask. Then all of a sudden it shows him wearing his new costume... Please someone tell me how he made it? iF you know please email me... Someone explain the hundreds of other ridiculous things that happened in this movie... please, I just dont get it. I know this a franchise, money making movie, whatever... but why after the entire movie of peter whining how much he loves MJ, does he just say "i cant?" Man that is a complete waste of the movie... it defeats the entire purpose... there is absolutely no closure... god why was the movie so bad? -the very best part is when he jumps on the car... and at the very end when he's swinging around. And oh yeah, there is 2 fight scenes IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE. Both of which were not even choreographed well. At best this movie gets a 6/10, only because of that car scene.
9.0~Comic Hero Spider Man, Fully Realized. ***** ebert_jr Sign in Permalink Can Sam Raimi do no wrong? I left the theatre thinking that. Spiderman is a stunning adaptation of the classic Spiderman comic series I remember as a kid (who collected them). There's a lot of moving, human interaction and feeling here. The dialogue isn't complex but it doesn't have to be. This is the world of the comic book, the touch of camp, the surreal lighting, and the very human (flawed) side of Spiderman that runs parallel with his greatness. The dual hero-boy innocence comes through in every scene and it really works. This is a very well made movie and not pure summer blockbuster eye-candy with a story sandwiched in between (somewhere).
2.0~What the hell???! part one marko_vitez Sign in Permalink Hollywood *rap. This is, along with Spiderman 2, the worst movie in the history of movie making! Patetic. With grate power comes great responsibility...Only *ull Americans can buy that *tupidity. Don't watch this movie, in fact if someone buy it on DVD suggest them to burn the copy! Tobey Maguire..is he gay or something...I don't understand how people can rate it 7.4, like they are *etarded. I cannot understand what is wrong with this people, like they breathe money. Terrible, I brought beer into the cinema to keep me in the good mood. The worst invested money of your life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Intelligence insult...
10.0~He is the AMAZING Spiderman!! spinningwheelsinc Sign in Permalink Saw a sneak preview last night. It is great. They have packed a whole hell of a lot of story into two hours of fun and excitement. Makes me hungry for a sequel (actually a series of sequels, to be honest) Go See This Movie! unless, of course, you have an aversion to fun and quality storytelling.
9.0~Here Comes The Spider-Man! greenheadjawsuniversal Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is one awesome comic book adaption. I think they got it right after years being held in development. This film displays great acting chops from Maguire as Peter Parker and a great menacing performance by Willem Defoe as Norman Osborn. Sam Raimi certainly knows the Spider-Man origin story very well. The film does have a couple of minor inaccurate changes, but this Spider-Man film is executed very well so in some ways it works, for example like his organic web shooters. Tobey MaGuire was the right choice for the nerd teenager Peter Parker. The moral of the story as long with the origin of the story, and it is very well told. I didn't like Kirsten Dunst as MJ. Shedid an okay job, but any other actress could have done better. WillemDefoe as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, was superior! Defoe's characterwas very menacing and evil, and so mean and nasty, he did a fine job there and there was nothing wrong with his part of the movie, I also like the way how Norman would treat Peter more like a son he would have than his own son Harry Osborn played by the amazing James Franco. Rosemary Harris as Aunt May has a full screen time, not just a cameo, and Cliff Robinson as Ben Parker, Peter's uncle, has a really great scene with Tobey, "With Great Power Come Great Responseiblity." Spider-Man is filled with excitement and a lot of cartoony fun, although the visuals look sort of out of date, but it is not something to take away from the movie. The visuals got a lot better when the sequels came along, as did the action. X-Men may have started the superhero genre, but Spider-Man really set the standard and popularized it. Director Sam Raimi is a master at pacing, and is able to move the story without any subtle changes and disjointed plot holes. The film moves at a right pace and he certainly has an eye for action sequences. This is one comic bookfilm they got right. Spider-Man is a well told superhero movie which brought super-stardom to Tobey MaGuire.
10.0~Sam Raimi finally getting the spotlight he DESERVES! Atticus_1588 Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi, one of my all time favorite directors! FIANLLY getting the spotlight after doing a huge movie, Spider-Man. Spider-Man is a genious piece of art work. Yes art work. Everything about this movie is perfect..direction, script, acting..everything. Sam Raimi is going to finally get what he deserves now, FAME! 10.0/10.0 A+ GO SAM!
9.0~don't forget to take your girlfriend along jediknight Sign in Permalink Seems like only two days ago I had the UNpleasure of watching the Scorpion King. I never went to see Blade II, although a friend of mine said it was good. I was waiting for Spider-man. Finally, yesterday, having left the ladies at home, me and my collegue (also a moviegoer and just like me not a very big fan of Spidey) went to the theatre with two tickets and a big bag of popcorn. Let me take you along... For five minutes I had to sit and chew popcorn watching the credits... boring, but reminds you the 80s, when many movies began this way. And what? We all loved that movies, because of what followed, of course. What followed was the story of a boy who.. you know;) By the way, this was the first time I saw Tobby Maguire. Meant for this role. Willem Dafo's Green Goblin definetely wasn't bad, at those short moments he wore no mask, he gave a very good performance of a person, struggling with himself - man, everyone in the theatre was laughing. But do we have to take this movie or its good/bad guys seriously? I guess, those of us, who will or have tried to, are the ones dissapointed. Now we come to the lady. In a movie, which is a comic adaptation, there MUST BE romance. Judge yourself, it's difficult to create a good plot, so it is substituted with CGI, them come more CGI and then the movie's over (see for Batman&Robin). Probably mindful of it, they gave Mary Jane a lot of appearances. With or without our hero. I bet many of you remember how she said she had to go to the actor's school. I just wonder how many of you would agree with me that she really should... However, the scene in the rain was wonderful - or am I too romantic? Pity, but the lady didn't see that one. The CGI were terrific, should I tell you that? Guess I'll see it again.. 8/10
6.0~"You're taller than you look." utgard14 Sign in Permalink Nerdy teenager Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is bit by a radioactive spider and develops new powers and abilities. After the murder of his uncle, Peter decides to use his powers to help people and fight crime. Meanwhile, billionaire Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) undergoes an experiment that gives him superhuman abilities of his own. It also drives him crazy and sets him on a collision course with Spider-Man. Maguire, James Franco, and J.K. Simmons are all great. Kirsten Dunst wasn't my ideal Mary Jane but she actually does very good. She's likable and pretty, which is about all the part is asking for here. The Green Goblin is probably the movie's biggest failing. They didn't really get his character right and Willem Dafoe's performance is too campy. Changing him into an armored goon didn't help matters. The bright, mostly upbeat tone is exactly what a Spider-Man movie needs. However, it does highlight some of the fakeness of the CGI. The special effects are generally good although at times when Spider-Man is complete CGI he has that rubber-limbed thing going on. The organic web shooters bothered me more before I saw the movie than it did while watching. Although I could've done without the gross microscopic closeups of his fingertips to show us how "spidery" he is. Danny Elfman's score is forgettable and not in the same league as his work with Batman. Not quite the defining movie for Spider-Man as '78 Superman or '89 Batman were for those characters, but good nonetheless. The part of the movie where Peter decides to become a superhero and start fighting crime seems a little rushed and not as momentous as it should have been. It's a good start, though, and the sequel would be all that and more.
1.0~Am I the only one? ColeSear Sign in Permalink Who find this to be the most painful moviegoing experience in recent memory? I don't think I found one redeeming piece of filmmaking in this overproduced piece of garbage and it was just torturous to watch. Do I have to be a Spider-man fan to get what all the buzz is about? I doubt it because I had only seen the hackney, corny 60s Batman before the movie came out and that was a great piece of work. Comnparisons to Batman aside this movie cannot stand alone on its own two feet. This film is two-hours of anti-climax without an interesting or even developed character in the lot of them. While Tobey McGuire is a decent actor he's always had a boring screen persona, in fact, I couldn't find a vibrant personality in this film to liven it up. David Koepp, who has written or co-written some exciting films such as Jurassic Park and Panic Room couldn't have come up with a more boring and I'm guessing faithful storyline. There wasn't anything to punch it up or make it more lively. Of course, a slow paced story can be made more interesting and Sam Raimi is also largely to blame even though he's made some great movies in the past this most certainly is not one of them. Even if the story was designed with cliches in the comic book couldn't they have been avoided? I won't even go into them but they're all over the place. Willem DeFoe is also boring and the fights are lame and contrived and there wasn't an original or even a clever move in any of them. It goes without saying the special effects were awful and they go hand in hand with the trite motionless storyline. I don't think I've seen a worse studio film in six years. I didn't have to stand in line to see this one and I sure as hell won't be standing in line to see the next one.
9.0~Amazing, Spectacular, an Ultimate film true believers! tv_pikachu Sign in Permalink Sure Spiderman has some corniness, but finally, a comic book movie that is content knowing that it's a comic book movie! Spiderman doesn't try to pretend to be anything else, other than a movie based off the Spiderman comic; and I must say it's the first and only 'comic book' movie to use it corniness to it's advantage in enhancing it's entertainment value. I also tip my hat to Sam Raimi utalizing such brilliant colors. The movie pops out at you visually, as the colors are bright and fun to look at. All in all, Spiderman lived up to all the hype...excelsior!
10.0~A new standard is set adrian-87 Sign in Permalink To start: this is by far the best comic book adaption I have ever seen. The fact that this movie is situated in a real life city, makes it far more attractive than other super-hero movies. Sam Raimi did a very good Job creating a fantastic, visual fantastic action movie. OK, other super hero movies like the X-MEN offer nice visuals to, but when it comes to the acting, spiderman makes the X-MEN bite the dust! All acting is on a very high level. Tobey Maguire IS Peter Parker, the nerdish student, Willem Dafoe IS The Green Goblin/Norman Osborn (Osborn talking with his alter-ego is very cool) In fact this movie actually displays all the characters known from the comic books in the exact same way as you would imagine them out of the comic books. And, the art direction.... tremendous! The way spidey swings through the streets is very, very , impressive. Certain parts of this movie feel like if you are in a very cool rollercoaster ride. Now the question rises: does this movie have any weak sides? The answer is yes. EG, a microphone swinging through the screen. Do these weak sides bother? HELL NO!!! Spiderman is a fantastic piece of top-entertaining eye-candy. Well brothers and sisters, I think Spiderman is the new standard in how a comic book should be translated to a great movie. Therefore this movie deserves a 9.5 out of 10
10.0~Amazingly Spectacular LainieBlueEyes Sign in Permalink All those years of talk. All those years of cast, crew, writers...all over! Marvel's flagship hero of Spider-Man finally comes to life! The casting is nothing short of perfect. Tobey is wonderful as Peter/Spidey, Dafoe is frightingly fantastic as Norman/Green Goblin. Robertson and Harris both shine as Ben & May, Kirsten is fabulous as Mary Jane, Franco is grand as Harry. All these historic characters are brought vividly to life, especially that of Jameson. Sam Raimi's direction brings a great feeling to the film, you can tell he truly did put his heart into this project. The entire cast and crew give their all in this movie. Indeed it is "wonderous to behold" as someone said. Thumbs up guys, bring on Spider-Man 2!
6.0~A fantastic Movie so why did I only give it a 6 Donald Campbell Sign in Permalink I thought that the movie was fantastic, well acted by all the cast, and a great cast that visually seemed to look the comic book characters they played, not to mention great visual effects, it was like the comic books had come to life. BUT as I left the theater something seemed to be bugging me, then it hit me, where was the trademark Spider-Man banter? It's a shame that this element was absent, with out it it simply didn't feel right. my vote 6/10.
10.0~PERFECT! triptomte-2001 Sign in Permalink wow. this movies was great, i expected it to be trash, but it so good. i used to read the comics,i watched the animated show with my little brother and i own some of the comics the movie is based on.i've always loved spiderman, there are lots of details you'll recognize from the comic book like how peter parker places the camera in the web to take pictures and M.J calling him tiger. its simply the best comic book adaption ever.
10.0~loved it. able to keep all interested sfm2020 Sign in Permalink this movie was well made and put together. I loved it. IT was able to keep a 36 year old as well as a 8 year old interested at the same time. not many movies can accomplish that. I loved Toby Maguire as the dorky hero... He was perfect
10.0~Awesome grumpyass Sign in Permalink I loved this movie. I was never a bit fan of the comics but I always watch the Cartoon TV show. I thought this was the best movie I seen in 2002. I seen it in theaters 7 times, and I have it on DVD. I recommend any to what it even if they know nothing about Spider-man, watch it and you'll love it.
1.0~Awful. peprd6 Sign in Permalink This film is horrible. The acting is mediocre, the plot is awful, the dialogue is cheesy, and it doesn't respect the material. Tobey Maguire looks nothing like Peter Parker and doesn't act like Spiderman, he just has the nerd look. Mary Jane is one of the comic book world's hottest girlfriends. and they gave the role to an ugly and bad actor, Kirsten Dunst, who gives an inferior performance. Willian Dafoe was the perfect choice for Norman Osborn and Green Goblin, and he wasted it by talking to himself in the film. The Green Goblin looks like a Power Ranger. The CGI was very bad. I can't believe that people liked this film, although they started hating it when Spiderman 3 came out. This was just an awful film. I gave 1 star out of 10.
10.0~Excellent film, true to the comic character, those of us who have waited years will tear up. silvercoaster Sign in Permalink This film was well worth the wait. If you want to see Spider-man in all of his glory, go and see this film. It is nearly perfectly done and is the first film wherein the comic really comes to life. Now is our time, the people who have grown up with their imaginations lost in the world of comics will finally get to see their heroes, at the least the commercially saleable ones, on the big screen. Now all we have to hope for is that they don't screw up The Hulk or Ghostrider, both of which are in the works. ~Gene
1.0~Simply Terrible hidion Sign in Permalink Unless you watch this movie to see Tobey's pecs or Kirsten's breasts, I see absolutely no reason to waste the air it takes to breathe through this movie. Thankfully, I was able to become near-comatose after only 20 minutes of this awful film, thus restricting the air that I potentially wasted. Terrible acting? Yes. Horrible depiction of corporations, especially corporate boards? Yes. Completely unbelievable premise? Yes. Surprised that Hollywood could make such a bad movie? No. The people who lauded this dud, however...
9.0~AN AMaZING MOvie! TJFBryant Sign in Permalink Although Maguire may have seemed like a horrible choice for a superhero, especially before any has actually seen the movie, Boy could we have been more wrong. Toby Maguire emerges in the character of Peter Parker/ Spiderman. Before watching the movie, I would have chosen Maguire as the last person to play this part. Indeed, he extend beyond all of my expectations when I say this is certainly a break out role for the young actor. Not only will Maguire be immortalized as a comic book hero (e.g Harrison Ford/ Indiana Jones), He will grow as an accomplished and up and coming persona in Holleywood. The Movie, couldn't have been any better than it was without Toby. Toby made the character believeable, even if Spiderman only is a comic book superhero. Final Result. Spiderman is the Most Amazing Superhero film to be made so far (previously it was Batman 1989). I give it a subtle *** 1/2 - **** stars. Good job to Sam Raimi and all the cast for making most of the spidey fans impatiently wait in anticipation for the next one.
8.0~Finally.. TheXeroXone Sign in Permalink Marvel is starting to make some decent movies. Blade and Blade 2 were both good and Spider-Man is.. well.. amazing. I was a little skeptical when I heard Sam Raimi was directing it, but I was wrong. This is a great film. Mind you, its not going to please the purists. I heard a couple of them as I walked out of the theater whining about how it didnt follow the plotline of the comic or "Where was Gwen Stacy?" Personally, I don't give a rat's @$$ about Gwen Stacy or how they changed the storyline from the comics. You can't please purists, so why bother trying. This is definitely a movie for the true-believers. Sam Raimi should be proud of this achievement as should Stan Lee. I only hope that they learn from the mistakes of the Batman series and keep it one villain per movie and that they dont use the Green Goblin again until Spider-Man 3. If they are done right (and given proper funding), Spider-Man could easily last for 6-7 movies. My only complaint about the movie is that I wish Stan Lee had a better cameo.
7.0~Fun Blending of Fantasy With Some Reality noralee Sign in Permalink "Spider-Man" is "our local neighborhood super hero," according to the TV theme song played at the very end of the movie credits, and for our family he is, as there were several scenes shot in Forest Hills. That nicely grounds the fantasy in reality, as does Tobey Maguire's terrific performance with his insecurities and growing self-awareness of his powers. The movie is a lot of fun, with some LOL jokes, though I tuned out the repetitive fight scenes. This isn't the first movie to stage derring-do on the 59th Street Bridge putting the Roosevelt Island Tram in danger (I think it was "Escape from New York" that did that cool), but it's effective. But is the abandoned manse he tracks the villain into part of Goldwater Hospital? Poor Kirsten Dunst has very little to do, except be a damsel-in-distress, which is too bad. But that rainy kiss is a sure winner for the MTV Movie Awards. Most of the negative reviews have been of Willem Dafoe's villain, but I thought he was quite effective. For James Franco this is pretty much a prequel, setting him up to be the villain in "Spider-Man 2." Danny Elfman's music swept the action along. (originally written 5/11/2002)
10.0~unbelievable gamester9 Sign in Permalink I did not think that this movie was going to be this good. The thing that really made me want to see it was listening to Howard Stern in the morning earlier that week and he said that he loved the movies. I loved it so much, I saw it twice last weekend and plan to go again this weekend. I have to agree that the element that made the movie for me was showing how Peter Parker discovers and learns how to use his powers. You can actually see the transformation from HS nerd to Spider-Man. I know this movie will go down in history as the best comic to live-action movie ever. The acting was great, especially Tobey. This kid looks like a geek and played one wonderfully. I thought that he wouldn't be able to pull off Spider-Man, but he did. Go see this film. You will have the biggest grin on your face from start to finish.
4.0~Kind of Disappointing mnsourcer Sign in Permalink Slow to start and it never caught me in its web! With the exception of the adorable Toby McGuire, the entire film was dull. Willem Defoe certainly plays evil well, but who would have thought the Green Goblin could be such a quick study? Maybe I just got too caught up in the hype. I am sure it will be a hit for at least one weekend, I am interested to see how it fares in the following ones.
9.0~As a kid, you may get addicted to this film mkoesy Sign in Permalink The first time I saw the trailer for this film at the theater was amazing. Now the trailer I am talking is the one that was banned because it had the twin towers in it, where this helicopter gets stuck in this giant web in between the buildings. This was before the 9/11 attacks. Everyone was amazed and awed at the fact that a studio was making a film about Spider-Man. I on the other hand, when I came upon the giant web I started to believe that the movie was going to be about giant spiders in New York City. Then when Spider-Man came on, it was a whole different story. I did not know who this person was. I had never heard the name "Spider-Man". But when it was finally released and I went to see it, Spider-Man was the most amazing movie I had ever seen! It was breath-taking! I couldn't stop talking about Spider-Man and now it that has come back to bite me in the butt several times. Now everyone I know stereotypes me as a comic lover and a superhero fanatic. I don't even know an local comic stores where I can buy these things. And I tell people that but they keep on staying with their beliefs. But over Spider-Man is a great film and if you haven't seen it, go now and rent it or buy it, I don't care how just watch it!
4.0~After 2nd HBO viewing, the movie is worse rkcrawf-2 Sign in Permalink I saw this film last summer, and did not like it then (and I do like sci-fi/comic book movies). I saw X2 last week and loved it. I just watched a 2nd time Spider-Man on HBO, and it's worse than I remember. A poorly dyed-Kirsten Dunst is professing her love, and Toby looks like he's about to slip into a coma. It is, however, good to know that an angry mob throwing garbage can chase away a super-villain. I hope that as more and more people see this movie a 2nd and 3rd time, they realize how crappy it is. Hopefully in time, that they make Spider-man 2 or 3 worthy.
8.0~OK, once again sickink2 Sign in Permalink To sum it up, the movie was great. Raimi nailed all the little nuances from the comic, and the actors couldn't have been more suited to their roles. I've seen it four times so far, and I may even go again in a week or two. This is one of the best movies of any genre to come around in a while.
7.0~A lot of fun and a good film to watch. richieandsam Sign in Permalink SPIDER-MAN This is the original Sam Raimi version. The movie is about a school student and photographer who gets bitten by a spider and develops special powers like a spider. His nemesis in this is the Green Goblin. I like this film I know the Sam Raimi version got slated by a lot of people, but the films were a lot of fun. The feel of this film is very comic book. But that is what I like about it. I felt that with the latest Batman trilogy they took the comic feel away from it and made it into a very dark, realistic feeling movie I loved it, but I still preferred the Tim Burton version of Batman because it still had the comic book feel. The effects are not too bad, but at time you can tell that there are a lot of computer generated moments, especially when Peter is sunning along the roof tops. The casting was quite good, but I thought there were some lines and scenes where they delivered the lines so badly. Especially MJs facial expressions at times I have to admit, I did laugh at it. Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He does a great job. I think he is a good actor, but haven't really seen him in much else. Kirsten Dunst plays MJ. Kirsten is a very good actress, but this is not her best work. She has times where she is very convincing, but other times she was quite bad. James Franco plays Peters best friend, Harry. James has grown in leaps and bounds he was good in this film. I understand completely why he is as big now as he is. The Green Goblin is played by Willem Defoe... he is an excellent choice for this role. He has the perfect facial expressions for the part and does a brilliant creepy performance. I also really like the cameo appearances from some famous faces Stan Lee, WWF Superstar, the late great Macho Man Randy Savage and the legend that is Bruce Campbell. There were parts of this movie that I thought were ridiculous. It just didn't make sense. Peter gets bitten by a spider, it swells up so badly and he feels really ill so instead of going to the doctor or hospital he goes home to bed? Really? No-one would ever do this! I also thought it was really funny how MJ was so confused all the way through the movie she was so immature for her age. She starts the movie by dating the school meathead, then starts dating Harry, then she has a school girl crush on Spider-Man and then ends the movie telling Peter that she loves him Blimey, get a grip woman! It seems that she has no clue as to what love is. This film is a great movie which I will watch again and again. Sam Raimi has done a good job with it and I love the way the whole film feels. A nice little finishing touch was right at the end of the credits you get to hear the classic Spider-Man theme tune! Awesome! I will give this film 7 out of 10. "With great power, comes great responsibility"
9.0~Spider-Man (2002) - With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility! nickmesafilms Sign in Permalink Considered as one of the most successful superhero movies ever made, "Spider-Man" is a superhero film adaptation of one of Stan Lee's most popular Marvel comics, and becoming one of the first movies to score the highest opening weekend in the box office. There's no wonder, because this is an exciting and enjoyable motion picture. One of my childhood favorites, to be exact! This movie tells the origin story of Peter Parker, or Spider-Man, portrayed by Tobey Maguire, whom after being bit by a radioactive spider, he has gained extraordinary powers to climb walls, shoot web, and beat bad guys. But all that must be put to the test when Parker has to defeat one of the first villains of the Spider-Man universe, the Green Goblin, portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Although Maguire is somewhat bland in a few of his movies, I respected that he fit the role of Peter Parker perfectly, playing a shy kid, with no powers to either beat the bad guy or win the girl. Although given some of the corniest lines of dialouge in this movie, Kirsten Dunst makes an adorable portrayal as Mary Jane Watson, while giving a great chemistry with her co-star. But, Willem Dafoe seems a little miscast playing the deadly Green Goblin, feeling more like he's suitable for drama, instead of action. Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and J.K. Simmons, round up the supporting cast, bringing some memorable performances on-screen, especially Simmons, who steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, the angry editor chief of the Daily Bugle. There are few corny and goofy moments from here and there, but that doesn't stop the exciting momentum that this movie brings. Filled with impressive visual effects and a wonderful music score by Danny Elfman, director Sam Raimi perfectly stays true to the original Spider-Man concept, and delivers plenty of exciting action sequences that are both fun to watch, and stay true to the plot. Behind "The Dark Knight" and "The Avengers", "Spider-Man" is probably my third favorite superhero movie. I can watch this movie over and over again, and it's still a fun time. I was easily impressed with this movie, and it never disappoints to entertain. Everyone will find something to enjoy for sure. "Spider-Man", in my review, "a refreshing story, and exciting action".
10.0~A real sensual delight tasha1972-1 Sign in Permalink One of the best films this year, definitely worth waiting for, great special effects, emotional, spell-binding, a real sensual delight. This film transported me back in time to my youth when I would read marvel comics for hours on end, deep in fantasy and loving every minute of it.
8.0~Top Stuff pugheaven Sign in Permalink have to say, thoroughly enjoyed it... some of the effects look a little "elastic"... but overall... done superbly... acting is good... although Maguire ain't the most natural on earth... although he fits his character well... Dunst is well, stunning to be honest, and that "wet scene" for the Dads with the kiss, is something I'll take to my grave.. great story... expertly done by Raimi... shame it started going a little wrong with the second one... the only downside is the Greeen Goblins head mask... which should've moved around the mouth and is something I hated when first seen the film... Dafoe is excellent as well in this... 8/10
10.0~Pretty darn good...i gave it a 10 (spoiler!!) dance_4_life14 Sign in Permalink First I'd like to say that he made an idiotic decision at the end, but hey, i guess it leaves the field open for the sequel (which i can't wait for...)! Although I don't understand why Harry (is that his name?) wants to get spiderman...i mean, he didn't do anything! oh yeah...tobey's hot! highly recommended
10.0~This Is The Best Movie I Have Seen This Year!! :) Funkypizza2001 Sign in Permalink SPIDER-MAN STARRING: TOBEY MAGUIRE, WILLEM DAFOE, KIRSTEN DUNST AND JAMES FRANCO It's not a bird, it's not a plane, and it's not Superman. It's Spider-man - the wall crawling, web shooting superhero that's more incredible then the commercials make it seem. This movie shows the evolvement of Spider-man (played by Tobey Maguire) who not only tries to win the love of Ms. Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) while living in his normal Peter Parker self, but battling the arch enemy, The Green Goblin (played by Willem Dafoe) who is also his best friend's (James Franco) father. Early on in the movie is when the Spider-man powers are added in. While on a class trip to a museum, Peter Parker - the class nerd - is bitten by a spider that soon gives him the powers he'd never thought he have. The movie is full of action-packed fighting sequences with some of the most realistic and incredible special effects that has been put into a movie. Spider-man is a must see this year, even people who didn't grow up on the comic will love it. Go see it! I give it ***** stars out of *****.
8.0~Great acting & direction save dull script & bad fx bburns Sign in Permalink Let me get this out of the way first: yes, the script was a by-the-numbers comic book adaptation; and yes, the computer-animated sequences look fake. That being said, "Spider-Man" is the best big-budget superhero film I've seen since "Batman", and the best superhero film of any kind since "Darkman". The credit for this clearly falls into the hands of director Sam Raimi and the talented cast of actors he assembled for this film. Since pretty much everyone under the age of 50 knows the story of the origin of Spider-Man (especially Internet-savvy computer users), I won't bore you with details of the plot, since it's mostly a re-hash of that story. And for those who have seen "Darkman", you can pretty much fill in the details. What I will say is that Sam Raimi--after spending the last ten years restraining his trademark visual style--now embraces it with full gusto. The same eye-popping visual acrobatics he used in the "Evil Dead" trilogy and "Darkman" to enliven cheap, sub-par visual effects are now used to enliven expensive, sub-par visual effects. The opening titles alone are super-cool. Who would've thought going back to his cult-filmmaker roots would give Raimi his greatest mainstream success? And unlike so many other blockbuster summer flicks, the pacing doesn't feel particularly slow in the first half, or rushed towards the end. There are no extraneous scenes put in just to show off the special effects, and the action sequences with bad dialogue are mercifully short and are not the movie's focus. The emphasis is more on character development. Especially Peter Parker's unrequited love for Mary Jane. And the acting is uniformly superb. Especially Willem Dafoe as scientist-industrialist Norman Osborn and his crazed alter-ego, the Green Goblin. Whereas most great actors camp it up in super-villain roles (think Jack Nicholson in "Batman" or Gene Hackman in "Superman"), Dafoe plays it straight and comes off as very believable both as a sociopathic monster, and as a man grappling with a sudden attack of schizophrenia *and* multiple-personality disorder that makes him do things he finds morally reprehensible. The mirror scene is the best thing in the film. Also worthy of mention is James Franco who plays Osborn's son Harry who is ironically Peter Parker's roommate. He mimics Dafoe so well, you wonder if he really is Dafoe's son. And of course the two leads are great, but anyone who saw "Little Women" or "The Ice Storm" shouldn't be surprised. Even the insignificant roles were great. In a perfect world, there would be an Oscar category for best cameo, and both Bruce Campbell and Cliff Robertson would be nominated. "Spider-Man" is not one of those films that will make anyone's ten-best list at the end of the year, nor will it be singled out for any awards come Oscar-season. But it is solid entertainment with enough visual panache and brilliant acting to make you forget about the cliched script and the sub-"Titanic" computer animation. 8 out of 10.
8.0~Pretty good movie, especially for a comic book ztkl40a Sign in Permalink I gave this movie an 8 out of 10. Out of the comic book movies I've seen (all the Batmans, all the Supermans, X-men, Spawn, and a few others that I can't think of right now), this ranks at the top along with the first Batman. Out of all the movies I've ever seen, it's good, but not the greatest. Let me start out by saying that I never read the comic, but followed the latest incarnation of the cartoon and watched the 80's version when I was a kid. So I'm not the most die-hard fan, but I know the basics of the story. There were a few changes to condense the storyline into a two hour movie, but the movie stayed very faithful to the spirit of Spider-Man. The fact that Stan Lee was an executive producer must have helped with this. The casting of the main characters was good. I thought Willem Defoe as the Green Goblin/Norman Osbourne and J.K. Simmons as Jonah Jameson did the best, although Simmons appeared in a dissapointingly small amount of the movie. Tobey Maguire did an excellent job as Peter Parker. I was a bit worried about seeing Kirsten Dunst as a red-head, but after the first five minutes, it was no longer distracting, and she did a good job as Mary Jane. James Franco performed well for the character he had. The story was pretty good, but not great (it's based on a comic, after all). It's not the typical good vs. evil (although it's close), it's a bit deeper. Harry Osbourne is not portrayed as a completely evil person. He's a business exec trying to save his company and his place in it. Once he becomes the Green Goblin, there's still the distress he has over the actions he commits as the Goblin. And Peter Parker is not all good. He eventually becomes a hero, but not after his initial apathy towards the people of the city. And in keeping with the spirit of Spider-Man, he has problems in his personal life both related and unrelated to his superpowers. The special effects were also good but not great. This is not so much a fault of the creators, but of the technology itself. It is some of the most convincing animation of a human form in action yet created, but the images still look a bit cartoonish. Hopefully the technology will be better by the sequel. Anyway, to sum it up, I only make it out to the big screen about four or five times a year, but I'm going to try to watch this movie in the theatres again. I'll get the DVD as soon as it comes out, and I'm looking forward to the sequel. As long as you don't expect this movie to be the next Godfather or Casablanca, and you're not too tied to the exact letter of the comic, you'll probably enjoy this movie.
9.0~SCIENCE-BUDS matthewhoggett Sign in Permalink At the start of the movie, we see Peter and Norman talking science and it then evaluates their knowledge throughout the film even after they become arch-rivals, Spider-Man and Green Goblin!
7.0~A disappointing success?? mysteri Sign in Permalink I have to say that the marketing of this movie was successful, frighteningly successful. The movie itself, however, was disappointing. The graphics in the film were spectacular, and the effects were, to be honest, quite amazing. They effectively pulled the comic from the pages of a book and put it in a feature film. The disappointing aspect of the movie, though, is the dialogue. Granted, Peter Parker is a bit of a geek, and the Green Goblin is insane, but the dialogue for these characters is way over the top. They've exaggerated the stereotype, and I'm not quite sure if it works for this type of movie! You can't really compare it to Batman, even if that would be your first inclination - they are hardly related. The darkness of the Batman movies is a stark contrast to the light-heartedness of Spider-Man. It is my opinion that the movie would be unstoppable, if the characters had each stopped talking a few minutes earlier.
10.0~A Perfect Movie By Raimi ozgul86 Sign in Permalink i think this movie will get all Oscars.because its image effects are perfect and casts are wonderful.especially Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst.they act like they love each other in their own life.after this movie Tobey Maguire's star will begin to shine
7.0~An overall good movie theninja Sign in Permalink This was a pretty good movie overall, however I still prefer the Batman movies (call me old fashioned). The special effects were a little o.t.t. in places, but this was to be expected. The Green Goblin's costume was very strange. It looked like it was stolen from the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, yet at the same time I think this made it more menacing, with a bit of humour twisted into the evil. This I thought worked very very well. Great cast, particularly the lovely Kirsten Dunst. She is simply gorgeous. An overall good movie. 7/10
6.0~As a kid you loved the cartoon, as a grownup you wished those days back smooth-miracle Sign in Permalink As a young kid you got out early of bed just to watch those marvelous marvel comic book hero's on television like the 'amazing' Spiderman. This one almost got me wishing I'd stayed in bed that day... I have to say that Spiderman the movie isn't that bad, but something about it just said to me that it was a just above average kind of film. Peter Parker a real full time freaky nerd in the beginning of the movie? They could have portrayed him much better then that, he didn't look like the science wiz to me either. The movie was more focused of him being Spiderman, maybe even too much, instead of Peter Parker himself. But to know more about Spiderman, you have to learn more about the person behind Spidey. And what about Flash Thompson? He looked more like some blink 182 fan rather than a college football star without the brains. The best character in the entire movie was without a doubt J. Jonah Jamison, superbly acted by J.K. Simmons. He blew me away with that performance! The scene on the Brooklyn Bridge was truly pathetic, Mary Jane Watson looked like Xena when the Green Goblin took a poke at Spidey and had the cable swinging heavily, she still could hang on to it instead of dislocating her shoulders. Seconds later she drops like 50 feet and grabs hold on to the bar like she was Xena again, didn't she Sam? Then comes the part of "When you mess with one of us you mess with all of us", wich was America at it's 'best', but to me sounded so lame like a bad dialogue of some Hercules episode. Spider-Man is a nice movie, but could have been much greater, Sam Raimi did use some elements from other movies which I thought was great because it blended in perfectly (Balloons ="Batman"), but next time he needs to keep those Xena and Hercules stuff out. Peter Parker did some flips with his fight with Flash that reminded me of Xena. The only real thing that was great about the film were the visuals. They were really mind boggling, and that's why I give this movie a 7 out of 10, but this movie doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the top 250 movies of all time.

8.0~A very good movie jcruz729 Sign in Permalink I am one of the biggest Spiderman fans(geek)out there so I really enjoyed this movie. I think that the casting for both the protagonist and antagonist were great and the supporting characters were excellent. With that being said I actually have to admit I was very disappointed that the movie never actually showed Peter Parkers intellect. What I mean is that they gave him organic webbing instead of him building his web-shooters, sure the organic webbing is great, but the only time you know that he's a genius is when Norman Osborn(Green Goblin) mentions that he won the science award. Yet through out the whole movie you are shown what a genius Norman Osborn is with all his goblin gadgets and the goblin formula itself. True fans will find minor disappointments but this a great movie that should please just about everyone.
10.0~A near perfect movie bbvince1 Sign in Permalink Whenever a studio decides to do a comic book adaptation, they walk the tightrope of having to please the die-hard comic book fans while at the same time, bringing the story up-to-date and making it entertaining and relevant. What makes this movie click is top-notch acting, especially from Tobey Maguire (Wonder Boys, Cider House Rules). He elevates the role of Peter Parker from comic book serial to that of a real person, complete with human weaknesses and imperfections. Ebert wrote that his acting is "pitch perfect", and I couldn't agree more. The rest of the cast is not chopped liver either. Kirsten Dunst shines opposite Tobey, and the audience can actually believe that there is a real chemistry between them. The story is fun, not taking itself too seriously, while at the same time, allowing itself to develop in order to bring the characters closer to the audience. Special effects are good, but not great. I will say that it is refreshing to see a movie of this caliber invest the time to make the story real. 100% recommended. One of the best of the year, for kids and adults alike.
8.0~Good storytelling. jmyoung Sign in Permalink This is primarily a response to Mr. Bunch's opinion. As both a long time comic book fan as well as movie buff, I have to say I am tired of people that exalt style over substance. Batman does not even come close to this movie. In general, while Burton's films look good, they are primarily all style and no substance (with a couple exceptions such as Ed Wood and the Nightmare Before Chistmas). This movie actually had a STORY and a PLOT. That it is not to say that I thought it was perfect. I agree that Dafoe's performance was a bit over the top and some of the dialog sounded like it might have come from a 60s comic. Further, some of the CGI did not come off perfectly and the laws of physics seemed to be ignored in a couple of cases (the cable car scene especially). However, Raimi blows away Burton when it comes to telling a story. Evil Dead II is an alltime classic. Also, the Gift and the Quick and the Dead were both fine movies (though I don't think either was great). Raimi is also good at characterization. I don't see how anyone could knock Maguire's performance, or Dunst's for that matter. They actually portrayed characters. Keaton's acting in Batman was defined by his lack thereof. And I like Keaton. This movie is up there with the original Superman movie for all time great comic adaptations, and it is not as corny.
1.0~Amazingly mediocre! chucknorrisfacts Sign in Permalink All right, I am going to try to give a fair and balanced view of this film as best I can. Although, I must say it won't be easy. You see, I grew up on comic books, and although I realize anytime a work is adapted to another medium it may retain certain characteristics while losing others, I know this. However, I think this film took too many liberties with the source material, which in my opinion only ending up hurting the final product. Where to begin? Hmm, that's a tough one. I guess I'll start with casting. It's not that I dislike Tobey Maguire, but I don't consider myself to be a fan of his necessarily either. I have seen other movies he's appeared in and have liked some of them, but he was not right for the lead in this picture. Who do I think would have been better suited for the part? Almost anyone. Then there's Kirsten Dunst, who I also found unsatisfactory in her role as Mary Jane Watson. Before I critique her performance, let me just start by saying I'm not sure why they included Mary Jane in the first film anyway. I think it would have made a lot more sense for the love interest to have been Gwen Stacy, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Kirsten Dunst just didn't capture the feisty, wily attitude of her comic book counterpart. Maybe this wasn't entirely her fault, as she did not write the script which would ultimately determine what lines she'd say, but her lack of "punch" to lines she did have was her fault alone. James Franco was one actor whose performance I actually enjoyed in the movie. I think he was terrific as Harry Osborn and was quite likable, despite being positioned as Peter's rival of sorts for the affection of Mary Jane. He didn't play a large part in the movie, but he steals all the scenes he's in. I just wish they would have utilized him better in the film's sequels, but I'll save that for my reviews of "Spider-Man 2" and "3" yet to come. I think the choice to give Peter Parker organic webbing was a sacrilege. It was a cop out is what it was, a way to eliminate a few extra minutes of screen time by not having to show Peter create his trusty web-shooters, but for all the time spent mentioning how smart Peter is, they never show him make anything! No web-shooters, no tracers, nothing! Why no gadgets? Come on! I think the scene in which Peter discovers his newly improved body was OK, except for the thinly veiled penis joke they threw in. Why do this? Do we really need to know that the spider bite made Peter's dick bigger? No, we do not. For those of you who don't remember the scene in which I'm referring toI suggest you take another look at the film. Peter glances downward at his body and speaks of his "big" changes. Although in the comics, Peter had been romantically involved with Betty Brant before Gwen or Mary Jane, I still feel that since the film took liberties with the source material anyway, why not go ahead and leave out Betty Brant, include Gwen Stacy, and introduce Mary Jane either later in the first film or in the second? The whole "Gwen Stacy/Mary Jane dilemma" shows itself to be its most problematic toward the climax of the film, during a fight between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin (who looked absolutely ridiculous, by the way). In the battle that ensues, Green Goblin throws Mary Jane off the Queensboro Bridge and Spider-Man comes to the rescue and saves her before she can meet her demise. So what's the problem? Well, this echoes a critical turning point in the Spider-Man mythos, the death of Gwen Stacy. Gwen Stacy's untimely death serves as a reminder to young Peter Parker that despite all his amazing abilities, he can't save everyone. However, in the film this doesn't happen. Why? Because they decided to swap out Gwen Stacy for Mary Jane, and instead of having Spider-Man learn an important lesson, they (the filmmakers) forgo this catharsis and give us a "Hollywood happy ending" in its place. One final note before I start to wrap this review up, there was entirely too much CGI in the movie. I never felt as though I connected to Spider-Man because it was all too easy to tell it wasn't even a man I was looking at, only a computer generated image. I much prefer the classic 1970s live-action television series, "The Amazing Spider-Man" starring the perfectly cast Nicholas Hammond. At least you had a real guy in a real costume performing real stunts. I could connect with that, but not with this movie. Shame on you, Sam Raimi for failing to utilize such a iconic comic book character properly. Anyway, I figure that's good enough. If you've made it through this far, good for you! I'm too tired now to continue on, but I think I've made my point. "Spider-Man" is a disappointment that goes from bad to worse. Its sequels, unfortunately, are not any better. I blame Sam Raimi. I can't wait until the franchise gets rebooted, and maybe they'll get it right the next time around. I love Spider-Man, I love Stan Lee, I love Marvel Comics, and I mean absolutely no offense or disrespect by my review, but it's because I'm such a big fan that I hold such high expectations for a movie about this character.
1.0~They could have done much better than this... aaronjustice Sign in Permalink Okay, it's based on a comic book, but the movie didn't need to have a stupid, hackneyed plot like comic books do. To me, the movie felt like it was 3 hours long, the time just dragged on and on. Here's my beefs, Osborne (however you spell his name) works for a company that has a personal hovercraft, weird orbs that can dissolve flesh, shoot orbs, and create massive explosions without harming main characters like MJ and Osborne's son, and a special chemical that increases a persons strength (while making them homicidal and insane). That's like Microsoft making computer software, shell casings for 25 cent super market trinkets, and the cushionie undersole on Nike shoes. Okay, Dunst and Macguire were good for the parts, but I can't stand Tobey's voice. I don't hate or like the guy, but that voice... anyone would recognize it, even behind that red mask. Apparently this will be one part of a trilogy. I can only wonder who can be next. The only trilogy worth a damn these days seems to be the LOTR trilogy. the new Star wars and Spider-Man don't stand a chance against that well written, well casted trilogy.
8.0~I'm Spider Friendly. janne_w Sign in Permalink I loved this movie. I really enjoyed it for many reasons. First of all, they were right... it really is all about the girl. Look at all movies that have succeeded with few exceptions, and you'll find her there. The girl. This movie had the guts to say it outright. It set you up to expect that it would be a question of whether or not he gets the girl. I guess he did, but then he left her ungotten, if that's a word, and left us hanging. Maguire started out the nerd without a hope in the world to have his lady love... and through one series of events after another, finds that in reality he could, at least with the mask and spidy suit on. This movie is every true nerd's fantasy turned reality. Toby's cuteness only added to the fun of watching that nerd turn into the super hero. Okay... forgive me for sounding catty, but for reasons that I don't want to have to explain, Kristen Dunst disappointed me a little in this movie. Not really her, but her role. The girl could have had a bit more personality and she might have seemed a little less clueless or spacy all the time. Sometimes I just wanted to shake her and say, "Wake up!" Anyway, I did think it was well worth the time spent, and would love to see it again. I want to see the sequel too, since I did dislike the ending of the first one. (What was it the Stones said, You can't always get what you want).
3.0~A marketing success and a cinematic failure rsn72 Sign in Permalink More than anything else the success of Spider-man reflects the astute marketing strategy of its promoters. Relentless advertising and appropriate timing generated a huge wave of expectation that was sadly not fulfilled when one actually saw the film in the theatre. The best thing about the film was the casting of Tobey Maguire as Spider-man. Unfortunately the best parts of the film were those scenes that featured Maguire as Peter Parker without his super hero costume. Therefore the casting success of the superhero was somewhat neutralized by the fact that the actor (or the stunt double) spent most of the film under his costume. Detracting enormously from the movie was the feeling that the producers were constantly testing the waters for a possible sequel. Hence a thin story line already considerably pared down due to the necessity of including as many improbable stunts as possible, was weakened further by positing complex inter relationships among the main characters, which when realized on the screen appeared rather unconvincing. I paid good money to see Spider-man on the big screen, but you won't find me queueing up for its sequel which is almost a foregone conclusion.
10.0~Magic dreamlrdmorpheus Sign in Permalink To say I had been anticipating this movie would be a severe understatement. Since may days in elementary school I had day dreamed of a live-action Spider-man movie. One would think that a product of Hollywood would have no chance of living up to such lofty hopes but this does. The special effects are perfect. The plot is original enough to remain interesting but doesn't throw the ideas from its comic book origins out the window. Every character and every relationship is exactly as it should be. Even what some would consider background characters like Jameson are like they stepped directly from the pages of the comic. It's also very well acted. I actually start to tear up when Uncle Ben dies sometimes when i watch it now. I don't know what else to say except I love this movie and it is a true benchmark for movies of its kind.
4.0~Does not live up to hype dubbed bass Sign in Permalink Rarely does a movie do so poorly and get the acclaim that Spiderman has gotten. I can point out obvious flaws which have gone seemingly unnoticed. First of all I'd like to say that I like the Spiderman comic series, but I'm not a purist, it doesn't bother me at all that the web-slinger is biological instead of mechanical like in the comicbook. The first flaw is that it's incredibly poorly directed, even by cult-classic Sam Raimi standards. I've only seen the movie once and I noticed several continuity errors and at least two shots of the boom mic. In addition, it seems like Raimi just chose camera angles at random from a preset list, the only exception being for the swooping scenes. The acting was a bit over the top, which is acceptable because they portray comic book characters, which are necessarily melodramatic. The plot however was exceedlingly fast, and for all the discussion that this movie does really good with the Peter Parker Mary-Jane Watson relationship, I felt it was simplistic to the extreme. One last point, this movie has a couple of scenes which should clearly reveal Spidey's true identity, such as the cafeteria scene. Yet for some reason no one in the school, including Mary Jane thinks he's spiderman, until the very end of the movie. My question here is why in the world the writers would craft scenes which deliberatley make otherwise intelligent people appear as morons. The answer I feel is that the makers of this movie just wanted to make a movie about spiderman because they thought it was a cool story. Their treatment of it, however, left much to be desired in the category of quality assurance. This movie suffers from bad writing, mediocre acting (the exception in my opinion is the stellar performance by Kirsten Dunst), horrible direction, and a general lack of quality. Yet I still liked this movie, because as I said, I like the story of Spiderman, and this movie does relate the story very fast and fairly accurately.
1.0~Awful movie Alexandros-E- Sign in Permalink How in the name of god could you people watch this junk... This move outdoes and outmatches even The Hulk in lameness... Incredibly monotonous and guess what... you can't even download it from the internet... I guess its just another typical Marvel Movie.... Which comic character are they gonna ruin next? They already ruined X-men, Hulk and Spiderman... Another reason why I prefer DC Comics to Marvel. At least DC Comics respects the legacy of their characters... and are not consistent sell-outs... Shame...
10.0~Some Kick-ass Movie dicklal Sign in Permalink *some small spoilers* i've seen already seen this movie 3 times. and i still find it a great movie. some pieces made me laugh Go web - Up, Up and Away but the movie was great. the story was well thought, and the actors did a good job. the part in the burning building. that rocks. i've seen the matrix a few times, but the special effect in matrix-style in SPIDERMAN was much better, and realistic. one pity in found was the suite of the Green Goblin. it was bad, but i think that when the hobgoblin appear in another movie it would be better(i Hope So. the music was great, and Mary Janes BOOBS. :) this movie Rocks
1.0~MEDIOCRITY AT ITS PEAK! odor007 Sign in Permalink I must admit I enjoyed the first 45 minutes of this film. I loved Tobey Maguire who was perfectly cast as the classic high school nerd. I loved watching him overcome the odds against the school bullies, and I liked the entertaining scenes where he is exploring his new spider-like abilities. But after that, saying that the rest of the film went downhill would be a compliment. Dull, predictable, terrible acting, and so desperately action-packed and backed by gaudy Hollywood special effects that it was sickening. I found the assaults on New York by the ?Green Goblin? to be violent, disturbing (especially after Sept. 11th), and offensive. I even had to wake up my slumbering buddy next to me so we could have a debate whether or not to leave the film. Basically, the people who don't understand the title to this review, love shows like "Survivor," drive an S.U.V. and thought movies like "Pearl Harbor," "The Matrix," and "Gladiator" were fantastic are going to be the people who loved this film. Yes, that's right, it's a film that targets the masses like no other, and apparently is playing many "film lovers" like puppets. Those who believe that this was the best film of 2002 (I'm not even going to discuss those who thought it was the best film ever made) need to catch the first ride out of the Texas trailer park and explore something called independent cinema--"Blade 2" and "The New Guy" aren't the only movies out right now. The only two elements where "Spiderman" had potential for decency were the special effects and the romance. The special effects were so visually flawed and half-assed that it became a distraction, and the romance, well; let's just say it wasn't top notch. The dialogue made me embarrassed to be sitting in the theatre, and the acting complimented this dialogue wonderfully-the only human touches this film had were intended to be as dull and straightforward as possible, but were only confusing--first Kirsten Dunst (M.J.) stands up for Spidey and likes him, and then she blows him off for half the film. And finally, after hours of agonizing torment, the makers of the film decide to end things by (SPOILERS AHEAD) having the obsessive Spidey actually TURN-DOWN M.J.'s confession of love--after hours of us knowing how much Spidey loves her, the film ends with "we only can be friends." I also loved the only scene in the film that involved a blur of ethnicity?the entire film is flooded with white actors, and I found it ironic that the only scene where minorities pop out is a rape-scene--that is until our hero conveniently comes to save the day! I thought this film was too bad for me to take the time to review, but I felt I had to attempt to persuade the moronic millions who claimed that "Spiderman" was a gem. HOPED I SAVED SOMEONE OUT THERE $10 and a few wasted hours!
1.0~Spider-Man: The most hyped piece of trash available! mrunclebob Sign in Permalink I went to this movie with high expectations, but after i saw the Green Goblin or whoever that was, I lost all hope. The plot was horrible, the acting mediocre, and overall the movie reeked. IMDB Rating-3 IQ needed to watch this movie and get a thrill-3 ThE rEvIeWeR
10.0~i was extremely impressed, excellent job Sam! Bassinyourface5 Sign in Permalink I did have great expectations for Spiderman, ever since I saw the original trailer (with the twin towers); also because Spiderman has always been my favorite comic hero. However, I feared that it would have some cheesy faults like other comic-movies (X-men, Captain America). Surprisingly enough, director Sam Raimi did an excellent job of casting the roles and following the comic so well. The only faults were how Spidey emmits his webs, the Gwen Stacy character being omitted, and that Oswald actually turned into a goblin creature, not wearing a costume. But those few errors definitly did not stand in the way of my feelings for the film. The Green Gobliin costume was actually very 21 century-like and updated the story. Also, I liked the fact that it wasn't JUST action; there was actually a story. I thought Macho Man Randy Savage had a nice cameo as Bonesaw, as well as Bruce 'don't call me Ash' Campbell's role as the ring announcer. I normally don't do this, but since it was so well done and true to the classic comic, Spiderman gets a full 10!
4.0~Good, but not THAT good TheEtherWalk Sign in Permalink I liked this movie. It is extremely accurate with respect to the comics and tv shows. But there is something about it that I just can't put my finger on. Perhaps it is Tobey Maguire, who was good as Spiderman but awful as Peter Parker. He needed to show more emotion. Or maybe it is the suits which looked WAY too cgi for some reason. Green Goblin's suit was messed up looking. Or perhaps it was Spiderman's webshooters that just appeared on his arms instead of him having to build them. Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie. I just think it is a little bit overrated. It needs some tweaking, so I'll give it 7/10.
7.0~alright www-jats Sign in Permalink Normally I can't stand movies derived from comics, for example the duds that were the Hulk & Daredevil, but this one surprised me. An excellent take on the comic book character created by Stan Lee. Next to the X-Men movies that came out about the same time, and Superman with Christopher Reeve, it is definitely one of the better Comic to Movie films put out. The cast is well chosen. McGuire is Spiderman/Peter Parker to me. I don't think they could have chosen better. Kirsten Dunst makes a decent Mary Jane Watson, wasn't ever fond of her to begin with, but it's pulled off well. Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin is sheer genius. The story is well written and keeps you along for the entire ride, coupled with action that's explosive and thrilling. Definitely fun for all, even die
7.0~Better Then Expected gemynd Sign in Permalink This post may have spoilers in it, so please be careful when reading. I went into the movie not expecting much. I am not a big fan of Toby McGuire (Spiderman) nor of Willem Dafoe (Green Goblin), so my expectations were low. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the movie. The story was good, and the action was well done. I was able to suspend my disbelief for most of the movie, which is rare with action movies. In other words, no superhuman feats were thrown about recklessly, beyond what we are expected to take for granted (Spiderman's incredible strength and agility). There are a few (rather small) problems that I encountered. First, although movies tend to stray from the original (a comic in this case), I am a little surprised at how they modified how Peter became Spiderman. He was bit by a spider - nothing more. Yes, I know the spider was genetically altered, but what happens if others are bitten by the spider? Will there be dozens of Spidermen out there? It just would have been nice if the event was truly unique. Second, the romance was a bit overdone. This could have been trimmed a bit with no real loss. Third, I still can't get over the actors they chose for the role. Outside of that, however, was a movie which featured some great action sequences, a good blend of comedy, and a not so subtle hint at a sequel. I'm sure to catch the next one.
1.0~Disgustingly BAD !!!!! sperman Sign in Permalink I really don't understand all the fuss about this so-called movie, because I'm not even sure we can consider it in such way! But let's start. Actors: what actors? The only good and cool one is Willem Dafoe, because the others are more or less parodies. Characters: pure stereotypes, which is quite normal because the movie is taken from old Marvel comics, but it really doesn't match with nowadays requirements for thicker personalities. The only attempt to awaken the human side was made on Spider Man himself, and was pretty bad and flat. The girl is an outrage to women and so also is Parker's aunt. Special effects and computer graphics: one would expect at least to have decent effects, considering that we are in the era of computer graphics, but it is not so. Effects are BAD. The animations of Spider Man flying around are as fake as they could have been in the 80's and the fights are copied (once again) from Matrix, only they didn't even manage to copy them decently. Dialogues: totally flat. Jokes are sitcom-oriented and simple-minded (with a couple of exceptions) and the effort to make Spider Man look human falls miserably into stereotype. General overview: AWFUL. The movie is soaked with bad propaganda about US strength and unity, typical of periods of crisis when a nation needs superheroes. Already the fact that it was re-edited to censor the scene with the World Trade Center (which was anyway the main scene in the old trailers) made it a miserable attempt to be politically correct. Altogether boring and pathetic.
10.0~This is a great Spider-Man film to watch & relive! mastuhoscg Sign in Permalink I like this movie. I remember watching it at a young age & I was happy. I especially liked how Tobey Maguire was Spider-Man. He looked exactly like Peter Parker & he was the best actor for the part. If it wasn't for him & Columbia Pictures, this film would have NOT made as much money as it did. I can honestly say that this is gonna be a delightful action movie for you Spider-Man fans worldwide. If you haven't watched this film already, you should. It is that good, much better than into the spider-verse.
10.0~Spiderman Rocked!!!!!! tina72899 Sign in Permalink I absolutely loved this movie. I don't know how to put it into words. This is how all superhero movies should be done. Tobey Macguire is my new hero. No pun intended. I can't wait till Spiderman 2. I was a little skeptical about Macguire for this role, but he totally pulled it off. Spiderman Rocked!!!!!!!!!
10.0~Brilliant Family Film crory585 Sign in Permalink Spider-man was a brilliant movie. Sam Rami (director), being a spider-fan from the beginning helped the franchise superbly. The crossover from comic to film was done in the best way I could have imagined as it introduced the villain on a more emotional level as peter parkers best friends father. The story was well paced and developed well through to the end. The characterisation of comic characters were perfectly portrayed, especially that of J. Jonah Jameson by the wonderfully talented J.K Simmons. One of the best moves I think, contrary to many fans, was the updating and realism they gave to the Green Goblins costume, incorporating Normans military and machine background and collection of tribal masks. Willem Dafoe as the green goblin, I think stole the show and outdone the superbly talented Toby Maguire. The scene where he has a delusional discussion with his alter ego through the mirror is wonderfully portrayed in a psychotic manner and adds to the realism of Dafoe's schizophrenia. I also think the end paved perfectly for the 2nd film leaving Harry a bitter man, and a shadow of his departed father. Spider-man in close league with 'X-men' is definitely the best comic turned film we have seen. With the arrival of spider-man 2 however it will crush 'X-men' to dust!
8.0~Highly Recommended crippler_p Sign in Permalink This movie was much better than I expected. True to the original story of Spider Man. Dafoe is excellent. There are parts where it may be a little cheesy, but remember, this is a movie based on a comic book. Better than any of the Batman movies. And in my opinion, better than X-men.
10.0~The Best Superhero Movie Ever!! Workin_Man Sign in Permalink This movie is amazing. There is no doubt about it. Everything in this movie is great. The acting, special effects, story, anything you can think of. Everything just works perfectly. It is the best comic book to movie adaptation ever made! Spider-Man is different than other action flicks. It's better for one thing. However, there is something about Spider-Man that puts it ahead of other action movies. Maybe it's the acting. Maybe it's the special effects. Maybe it's the story. Heck, it could be all of them! What i'm trying to say is you will like Spider-Man more than your typical action/adventure flick. And for many reasons. This movie is amazing. I have said before but i'll say it again. I recommend this movie to just about anybody on Earth. All you fans of the comic books, you will be very surprised of this movie. It is very very well done. The verdict: An awesome movie recommended to just about everyone. 10/10
7.0~Good, if not quite amazing Fluke_Skywalker Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi's genre re-invigorating blockbuster holds up reasonably well. Maguire makes for an earnest and likable Peter Parker. He's not quite as comfortable with the wisecracking stuff as Spidey, but Raimi doesn't really focus on that very much here. Dafoe's a little hammy, but his performance fits in well with the tone of the movie. I found my self swooning over the sweetly vulnerable Kirsten Dunst, so mission accomplished there. And J.K. Simmons... Let me just say 'Whiplash' should've been his second Oscar (mild exaggeration, but he owns). The action scenes are a bit lacking in the thrills department, but the F/X work holds up pretty well save for a few noticeably dodgy sequences. And Danny Elfman delivers one of his least annoying scores. But what ultimately makes it work is its heart. Raimi gets the crux of Peter's journey--that with great power comes great responsibility--right (it's one of the many things I felt the reboot botched). As a result, the story and the characters all resonate emotionally
8.0~Cheesy Fun! Marx_Bros_Fan86 Sign in Permalink It's hard to believe it took 40 years to bring Spider-Man to the big screen, which is probably a major contributor to its success. Spider-Man is my favorite entry in the series because it's the least pretentious. Like most of the first entries in Superhero franchises, Spider-Man is an origin story. Once bitten by a radioactive spider, high school nerd Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) exploits his new powers to make money in a wrestling match, so he can buy a car to impress Mary Jane Watson (Dunst). After the owner of the wrestling ring pays Peter less than he was promised, a thief steals all of the owner's money. Peter, furious with his former employer, fails to stop the robber. Afterward, Peter finds his Uncle Ben lying in the street, with a bullet in his chest. To his horror, he discovers that the very same thief whom he failed to capture murdered his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson). Peter devotes his life to fighting crime as Spider-Man, using his Uncle's motto "with great power comes great responsibility." In the meantime, Norman Osborne, the father of Peter Parker's best friend Harry, experiments with a new steroid serum in a vain attempt to save his business. The serum drives him insane, turning him into a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde like character known as The Green Goblin. From here the film really picks up with some grand webslinging and goblin glider action scenes. Spider-Man is really the only film that adequately portrays the humorous side of Spider-Man's character. In Spider-Man 2 he's all depressed and in Spider-Man 3 he becomes an emo kid. Maguire pulls off the humorous and nerdy sides of his character quite well. The film has a near perfect cast, with Rosemary Harris as Aunt May and J.K. Simmons, who is absolutely hilarious as J. Jonah Jameson. Kirsten Dunst doesn't have much to do except be saved by Spider-Man, but she does as well as she can with the material. The movie pays a few homages to Superman, from Peter Parker opening his shirt like Clark Kent to the scene where Kirsten Dunst asks "Who are you?" ala Margot Kidder. There is a good balance of action and character moments, from Peter's conflict over Mary Jane and his superhero career to Harry yearning for his father's approval. The film's central theme, "with great power comes great responsibility," is conveyed without hammering it over the audience's head too much. The first half of it is rushed, and the CGI has dated poorly (but they really couldn't help that). The movie has a fair amount of cheese. As many other people have mentioned, Willem Dafoe's suit looks like a Power Ranger costume, and since his mask's mouth is permanently open, it's a little funny when he talks. In Dafoe's defense, all of his scenes as Norman Osborne are performed wonderfully, especially his split personality scenes in front of the mirror. I've always felt that the Green Goblin was Spider-Man's best villain, since his relationship with Spider-Man is more personal than most villains. The film also suffers from the Green Goblin's lack of a grand super villain plot, but the final battle still hits home. Comic book fans will appreciate its similarity to "The Death of Gwen Stacy." Peter's decision to walk away from Mary Jane at the end is a bit of a downer but still noble. None of this seriously detracts from the film's enjoyment though. All in all, this is one fun movie that isn't boring for a minute!
7.0~Great fun to watch with the whole family! atinder Sign in Permalink I gave this another re-watch after seeing new re-boot. Well this movie didn't have much action the latest one and a lot more of story just scenes of fighting and flying. There were A lot of slow scenes in this movie, with some really good action sequences I do like some of story that taken away from this movie that wasn't in the re-boot. I didn't find this movie as dark as new one, Which I still do prefer Maguire as man. I felt like we connected a lot more in this story and cared about him (I can't say the same thing new spider-man) The Actions scenes in this movie was really good and very decent not over the top and don't drag for too long. The acting was really good from the whole cast. 7 out 10 really good movie
3.0~Even Miss Muffet hates this movie Boyo-2 Sign in Permalink Okay, so it started out cliched but I was enjoying it anyway. By the time Tobey got bit by the spider (that would happen!) which happens ten minutes into the movie, I started to groan. By the end I was running to the exit and felt like I spent a week in that seat. Tobey is great, Kirsten is great, James Franco will be great..just not here. The screenplay is horrendous - all the actors have impossible dialogue to negotiate. Several of the set-ups are ridiculous - Peter Parker at the wrestling match was the height of stupidity; Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe, in a performance which tops his embarrassment called "Body of Evidence") is a stupid character at best and his Green Goblin was worse; and the romance between Peter and Mary Jane lacked everything you need in order to believe these two actors are really in love. There are dozens more.. Cliff Robertson gets a break by being dispensed with early on. Rosemary Harris has the best line in the whole movie when she says to Peter, "You're not Superman". J.K. Simmons breathes some life into the movie as a manic, hair-dyed version of Perry White, but then he goes overboard needlessly. I am so sorry that this was an ordeal for me. I wanted to like it but there's not a chance in the world that's going to happen. There is also not a chance in the world I will see the sequel, which already has a new villian in place in Harry Osborn (Franco) but will do it all with one less audience member - me. 3/10. PS Trivia fans - Dafoe and Harris were in "Tom & Viv" together; at least they had that decent screen pairing on their resumes..
10.0~Dang Excellent Movie sbpat21 Sign in Permalink This movie is excellente. I was never much of a Spidey fan until this came out. The directing is great, acting okey dokey, effects good, and perfect organization. I loved it. It tells of peter parker, a nerdy teen with a decent record who loves his cute next-door neighbor and is brilliant. He gets bitten by a radioactive spider in a demonstration and chance of fate, and develops powerful, cool powers like web-making, wall-crawling, and superstrength. When his uncle dies in an accident Peter refused to prevent, he put on a suit, and destiny awaited... SPIDER-MAN!!!!! However, he has to fight a villanous murderer in a cool, goblin armor suit, known as Spider-Man's most evil foe, The Green Goblin. It's a great movie. You should see it.
9.0~Excellent movie direhard Sign in Permalink This movie is really something amazing. I really didn't expect something like this, but I was amazed. I thought that this is going to be boring, something like "Batman & Robin", but I was in wrong. The visual effects are excellent, Tobey Maguire is great choice for the role of Spider-Man/Peter Parker, and Willem Dafoe... Ohhhhh, he is great, he is something wonderful. He is one of the greatest actors of our time, and that is the fact. About the movie, well, when I think a little bit, it is maybe childish, but who cares. Maybe director Raimi had to delete scenes with building in fire (when Spider-Man saves the little children from the building in fire) and perhaps, he had to find more "interesting" answers on love story between Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, but these are only little problems. End is very powerful (scene on the bridge when Spider-Man saves Kirsten Dunst and children) and the final ulitimate fight with Green Goblin in old house. In the end, I can only say: "From MARVEL something MARVELous."
1.0~Not great cougar18 Sign in Permalink Okay, first let me say, that I have not got a problem with the changes made to the film, in fact they kinda made the film cooler. But here's where I lost interest. Tobey McGuire is not very good as Peter, in fact, he seems bored, which is never very good for a leading man to be. And he has impressed me, especially in films such as the Cider House Rules, so I don't hate him. Kirsten Dunst is pretty good as Mary Jane, Uncle Ben should have been allowed appear for longer, as he is integral to Spider-man's origin, ***possible spoiler*** his death is like a key scene in a play, but it is brushed over very quickly, which seems lazy.*** The relationship between Norman and Harry, is very interesting, much more so than the main story, and is the one really developed portion of the film. But back to Tobey. Well, in my opinion, Tobey is not able to convey the sense of responsibility which, look at the spoiler, taught him. That speech he makes to MJ at the hospital, about what he told Spider-man, was cringe inducing, really over the top sappy. He is also not physical at all. Like Keaton in Batman, Tobey is rarely in the suit, and so all of Spidey's stunts are by stuntmen. These include even the basic, like where Spidey webs down before kissing MJ and the simplest fights (all classic poses are assumed by stuntmen) and so Dafoe was right about him being a wimp. I know this might seem like nit-picking, but actors who do all or most of their stunts seem to absorb the idea of the character more, and get into the role better. Some don't like Dafoe, or the Goblin outfit, but I think the suit works in the film and is really cool, and also Dafoe outclasses McGuire. The only good thing for me was the the costume, which was great. Some scenes of CGI were poor, but the last 2 minutes of it was the best part of the movie for me. Many will say that it's only a summer blockbuster, but if they have read a comic of Spider-man, and I don't mean the issues included with the DVD (which were not the best, to be honest), then they'll be able to see where the filmmakers failed. Overall, 6/10, the movie really caves halfway thru.
6.0~Spider, hit it with a baseball bat Michael Laing Sign in Permalink I hate dissing Sam Raimi But He has become far to sensible and that is the problem with with the film, it's has none of the fun that I was hoping it would have. The film is very well made but again with most film currently being made the CGI effects are at times ropy. The performances are good and some of the action is great. The main problem with the film is it sags in the middle. I have talked to several spiderman fans who have wanted to kill me when I told them what I thought of the film and none have been able to disagree with me. The film had tried vary hard to be adult and that is recommendable but its the grown up bits which slow the film down. The romance scenes just don't work, which is a pity but maybe I'm just a action junkie. The other thing that annoyed me was the lack of comic lines which spiderman is famous for. Hopefully they will start to come in the next film. Well, I hope the next film is better cos this one wasn't great.
10.0~Spiffing film. general-melchett Sign in Permalink Spiderman is a really good comic book adaptation - it is well-written, powerful and intelligent. Instead of just being action and no substance, this film is made great by the fact that it focuses on adolescent problems - girlfriends, exams, that banter, and also builds on the character of Peter Parker - there are times when you really feel sorry from him. The opening scene on the bus is a good one - it captures the humiliation and shyness of being the last one on the bus, and also makes you think about Peter Parker, "God, he's not a popular kid, I feel sorry for him." Uncle Ben's death was hugely powerful and effective - nearly as moving as things in Schindler's List and other tear-jerkers. I have to admit, that bit did upset me a bit. (But I shed no tears.) So you feel glad when Spiderman murders his killer. The bit when Peter Parker and Aunt May arrived home from Peter's graduation celebration made me feel slightly strange - it felt pretty empty and solemn without Uncle Ben. This only makes Spiderman better - it also has a soul, rather than being just plain action with no emotional side (like the sort of rubbish we get in cinemas nowadays). And that is what makes Spiderman a spiffing film. There is no denying that Spiderman delivers on the action front - it does have a slight terrorist theme, which is pretty daring so close after the 9/11 atrocities. But Spiderman is mostly a tale of revenge, and this is brought to the screen in huge epic battle sequences that you enjoy watching - after all, it is what this film was made for. Comic book adaptations should all aspire to this. My only criticism of this movie was that there should have been a bit more action in it, but apart from that, it was absolutely flawless - there were many stories going on during the film, and we cared about all of them. Well, I did for sure. This film should be in the Top 250 - it should have beat out that awful trash V For Vendetta easily. Many films these days are trying to mix adolescence into their stories - this is one in which it is done successfully. Whenever there was a death in this film, I felt really moved - they couldn't have been done better. On the whole, Spiderman is an absolutely spiffing comic-book adaptation - one that tackles many areas, and one that sticks in the mind for ages after. A stunning job - I solemnly believe that this was better than the sequel. A film that must be watched multiple times before it really hammers itself home. 10/10
6.0~Among the weakest of the comic-book spinoffs cwpnewpaltz Sign in Permalink Rank order (1) the children's fantasy books made into movies, and (2) the comic-books-come-to-life, and where will Spiderman come in? Well, for those of you old enough, the Superman trilogy with Christopher Reeve would have to rank pretty high; personally I think Dick Tracy was tops among the comics, with fabulous color and cinematography, a story that could hold one's interest, and a really engaging star in Warren Beatty. The original Batman was pretty fantastic. I don't read comic books, but I'd have to say I liked even X-Men better than Spiderman. And among the fantasies, Lord of the Rings takes the all-time cake, and Harry Potter was pretty good too. Spiderman is a modest attempt; it wasn't good enough to make me want to see (or even rent) the sequels.
10.0~Two thumbs up! george_mcfadden Sign in Permalink Just saw it last night. Excellent A+++. Good story, good acting, good costumes, good special effects. Had a comic-booky feel but was not silly. Willem Dafoe was excellent as the villain (sort of reminded me of Batman 1 with a big actor as the villain. Kudos Sam Raimi!). Tobey Maguire was a believable PP and Jonah Jameson was believable and right on. Can't wait for the next installment!
10.0~Best. Movie. Ever! paradox-4 Sign in Permalink Best. Movie. Ever. 'Nuff said. For all true believers, this is truly the ULTIMATE SPIN! AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME! In the words of the great Stan Lee, Excelsior! It really portrays Peter's struggle with life. The casting is superb!
8.0~Spider-Man jboothmillard Sign in Permalink If you are a fan of the really popular Marvel Comics super hero, or a fan of The Evil Dead from the same director, Sam Raimi, then you'll love this great high tech film. Peter Parker (at first unthinkable Tobey Maguire), the ordinary teen who is in love with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). One day on a school trip to a genetics laboratory, he is bitten by a genetically engineered super spider, and he goes through radical changes. He eventually practises his abilities, and after the death and revenge of his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), he becomes the saviour for New York, web-swinging, crime fighting superhero Spider-Man. Meanwhile, Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) has a similar "accident" where he injects a performance enhancing drug, and becomes evil alter ego, The Green Goblin. Also starring James Franco as Harry Osborn, Rosemary Harris as May Parker, J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, Bill Nunn as Joseph 'Robbie' Robertson, Ted Raimi (Sam's brother) as Hoffman and The Evil Dead's Bruce Campbell as Ring Announcer. With great action, some light violence, great music by Danny Elfman (he also did Batman), a love story and great special effects, fun for everyone. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Sound and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. It was number 46 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Very good!
8.0~Excellent Movie carehm Sign in Permalink The movie had many great special effects, however they didn't overwhelm the characters or lessen the characters impact. (IMHO) The movie seemed to be fairly faithful to the source Material. I'm looking forward to an inevitable sequel.
8.0~Has someone finally gotten it right? tenn-noodlehead Sign in Permalink The history of trying to transfer elements of Marvel's Universe to the screen, either little or big, is at best rocky and usually leaves a mess. Probably the first reasonably successful attempt was the first Blade movie. You could nitpick it some, but you really didn't have to be a fan of the comic to enjoy the movie. The next big success would have to be the X-Men. While it might not have always stayed true to the source material, it was a good movie and it did justice to the tone and theme of the comics. Spiderman, however is something of a cultural icon. More teenaged comic readers probably identified with him on such a level, that the mere thoughts of moving him to the big screen is terrifying. Spiderman was a teenaged superhero. He was strong and fast and agile. He could do things most people couldn't, but he was also a teenager. He had girl trouble, family problems, school problems, as well as a secret identity. He was never the strongest or fastest. He was usually weaker or slower than the opponent he faced, but he always outsmarted them in the end. Heady stuff for the readers. How to capture that in the movie? And how to bring in the cast of characters so neccessary to the story? Well they did it. They picked an excellent cast, a good script and turned it into a fast-paced movie that stayed very true to the storyline and themes of the source material. It isn't a perfect movie, the CGI didn't blend that well, the goblin costume left something to be desired and Mary Jane wasn't quite like I remember, but I still can't wait for the next movie.
10.0~One of the greatest superhero films ever made kalel32688 Sign in Permalink Although I am not terribly fond of spiders (or arachnids, for that matter), I am a big fan of the "Ultimate Spider-Man" comic books from Marvel as well as some of the issues from even before "Ultimate Spider-Man" came out. I heard a lot about the big-screen version of Spidey, and finally, when the movie came out on video some time ago, my mother bought it for me and I watched it immediately, and I was surprised at how well this film turned out. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a high-school nerd who lives with his aunt and uncle (Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris) in New York, is best friends with rich boy Harry Osborn (James Franco), and is head-over-heels in love with the beautiful Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), who happens to be his next-door neighbor. One day during a field trip to Columbia University where scientists have created fifteen genetically-enhanced spiders, one of the spiders escapes and bites Peter on the hand. Soon, Peter gains the proportionate strength, speed, and agility of a spider, and decides to use his powers to win some money at a wrestling match. When his uncle is murdered by a thug he failed to stop earlier, Peter learns the hard way the true meaning of his uncle's earlier advice to him ("with great power comes great responsibility"), and utilizes his powers to protect the people of New York as Spider-Man. At the same time, Harry's industrialist father Norman (Willem Dafoe) experiments with a human performance enhancer on himself and becomes the homicidal Green Goblin, who then challenges Spidey's vow to fight crime and the good of all. I really enjoyed this film, and there has been nothing like it since maybe either "Superman" or "Batman". Tobey Maguire does an excellent job as Spider-Man and his alter-ego Peter Parker, who, to me, is Clark Kent blended with Jimmy Olsen. Willem Dafoe steals the show as the psychotic, glider-flying Green Goblin with an air of psychotic wittiness that is matched only by Christopher Walken (it should be interesting to note that Dafoe starred with Walken in the film "New Rose Hotel"; maybe Dafoe picked up a few pointers from Walken. Hmmm...). Kirsten Dunst is fine as Peter's true love who fights for herself in one scene, then becomes the standard "damsel-in-distress" (no offense meant to her, though). The rest of the cast does fine in their roles, but it is the excellent musical score (courtesy of Danny Elfman) and the story itself that make this film worth a look (or as many looks as you want). "Spider-Man" is a great film, and one of the best films ever made. In my humble opinion, I give "Spider-Man" a 10 out of 10 on a scale of 1-10.
4.0~Someone needs a second viewing... rkcrawf-2 Sign in Permalink Either I need to see this movie again, or the people who are giving it the thumbs up need to see it again. Unless forced, I doubt I will watch Spider-Man again. Hopefully, the sequel will be leaps and bounds above this one. I feel as though the makers of this film "phoned it in." I do like this genre of film (Superman, Batman I, and X-men), but I almost had to walk out of this one. My supporting details are as follows: 1. Lack of chemistry between Maguire and Dunst. Yes, I know they were dating in real life, but they seemed like they were strangers. I almost fell asleep during the hospital scene and at the finale. 2. Maguire's lack of charisma. This movie should have been fun. The fun thing about Spider-Man was that he was a wise-ass, cocky teenager. Yes, Peter Parker was supposed to be dull, but Spider-Man is not. 3. Dafoe. Yes, comic book movies are an excuse for hamming up the villain role. But Dafoe made Schwartzenegger's Mr. Freeze look like Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor. The costume was bad (i.e., terrible), but Dafoe was bad even as Norman Osborne. 4. Writing. Most of the memorable comic book movies offer fans new information or a new story. This one was a mix of several famous storylines, complete with themes that had the subtlety of a sledge-hammer. 5. Effects. I thought the swinging looked cool, but the Sonic the Hedgehog bouncing was too much. Yes, he's agile. But he's not made of Silly Putty. For some reason, the Goblin bounced a bit too much. Only at the end of the movie, did I feel that we were looking at a man in a costume, instead of some CGI creation. Overall, the problems with this movie are the fault of the director. I like Sam Raimi's previous work. However, with this genre you have to have suspension of disbelief. As they said about the Superman movie, you have to believe a man can fly. At no time, did the movie pull me in far enough to make it the enjoyable fantasy it should have been. I think James Franco and the actor playing J.J. Jameson were the lone standouts.
5.0~Disappointing venture into big budget filmmaking by Raimi. Nigel_Tufnel Sign in Permalink When I first heard the great Sam Raimi, director of the "Evil Dead" films, was going to direct Spider Man I was ecstatic. Possibly the greatest comic book ever was going to be directed by one of the horror genres top directors. However, this being Raimi's first big budget film, Spider Man falls flat on its face. I will give credit to John Dykstra for the amazing effects, but the story seems slapped together. Plus, the ending is a sort of anticlimax. Batman is the real way to make a comic book film, keep the atmosphere true to the comic, make the characters interesting, and keep it unpredictable at all times. Spider Man was predictable, routine, and overall, dull. Hopefully the second film will get it right. Rating: 6/10
9.0~See this movie matthooper8 Sign in Permalink See this movie, see it now. You will not be dissapointed. It has something for everyone. 115,000,000 opening weekend, there must be something going right. Sam Raimi actually gets the actors to act well in a summer blockbuster, unlike the Star Wars prequels.
8.0~Great superhero movie, succeeds on almost all levels Horst_In_Translation Sign in Permalink "Spider-Man" was the start to Sam Raimi's superhero trilogy starring Tobey Maguire, one of the most promising young actors back then, as Peter Parker. He does a solid job with the character. Raimi was mostly known at this point for another trilogy, namely the Evil Dead movies, which he started directing in his early 20s already. Apart from Maguire, the cast has many more famous names. Kirsten Dunst plays the love interest Mary Jane. I'm usually not too big on her as an actress, but she is okay here. Peter's uncle and aunt are played by Academy Award winner Cliff Robertson (who sadly died not too long ago just like his character here) and Golden Globe winner Rosemary Harris. The main antagonist, the Green Goblin, is played by Willem Dafoe and may very well be my favorite character and performance of the film. His son (and at the same time best friend to Parker) is played by the young rising star James Franco. J.K. Simmons has a small role here and he may very well win the Oscar this year. He certainly makes J. Jonah Jameson his own. And finally, Octavia Spencer, long before she became famous and won her Academy Award, plays a one-scene character as well. I wrote in the title that there is almost nothing wrong with this movie and you'd have to dig really deep to find something, maybe this could be the end. I found Mary Jane's love confession too cheesy somehow and Peter's reaction left a bitter taste too. It's the girl he loved all his life and he just says no to her. Cannot believe that even with the whole power-responsibility reference. But back to the more positive things. One of my favorite parts was how Parker and Osborn (Dafoe) had such similar paths to what they became. What Parker wanted most was MJ, what Osborn wanted most was the success of his company. First, both fight against outside influences (the enemy company, Flash), then against inside influences (the sale, Harry Osborn) in order to get what they want. Parker succeeds and fights for the good side. Osborn Sr. fails and becomes evil. Of course, apart from that, a large role was also played by the death of Parker's uncle and how it all happened. It basically showed Parker that negative actions happening to other people can also affect him if he does not intervene. The movie runs for roughly two hours. There is a very clean split for Parker. The first half is about him being a normal boy who discovers his superpowers and we find out how he becomes Spider Man (including a funny wrestling match), who the people in his life are and how they shape him. The second half is pretty much all about the battle between Spider Man and the Green Goblin. Here, I especially liked the scene when the Osborn realizes Spiderman's identity. That disguise scene in the burning house was great fun too. In the end, with the last comments from Franco's character, we get a bit of an appetizer for the sequel. On a random side-note, Raimi just recently reunited with Franco for "Oz". You could probably discuss if Maguire is a better actor than Andrew Garfield, but I have to say I definitely prefer Maguire's Spiderman. It works so well, even if he is already in his 20s playing a teenager and there are many memorable scenes in this film, including the kiss between Mary Jane and Spiderman obviously. Thumbs up for writer David Koepp who has also shown his talent on "Jurassic Park" and "Mission: impossible" before 2002. And lets not forget Steve Ditko and Stan Lee, the latter even has a little cameo here. And finally a shoutout to Kevin O'Connell and Greg P. Russell, who scored one of the film's two Academy Award nominations and it seems they just cannot get the win. They would have deserved it for this one. Such a shame. The first Spiderman movie was, by far, the most seen film from the year 2002. Crowd magnets like Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars came short. And for good reason. This is one hell of a joyride. Very much recommended.

10.0~awsome!! Dentonco81 Sign in Permalink I loved the movie, I thought the specail effects where great, the characters where great, and the story was true to the comics. This movie left you wanting more of the "Friendly Neighborhood Spider". I have been a Spider fan for a long time and I feel that this move adds a new look for the new generation of comic readers. I believe that we all need a hero like this to look up to in this time of need and Spider-man has always been a symbol of juctice, freedom, and hope. I hope this movie has given you the same hope it has given me. Thanks you, Dentonco81
10.0~Truly Amazing! jctundis Sign in Permalink Having just seen the dismal Star Wars Episode 2, I felt compelled to comment on a movie that truly deserves to be seen. Spider-Man is a masterpiece of adventure film making. The pace, dialogue, characterizations, special effects, directing, casting and any other elements you can think of are all masterfully done. Every scene flows into the next. This is coming from a 20 plus year reader of Marvel Comics, so I know the web slinger very well. I even enjoyed the changes in Spidey's origin-- a clever combination of Amazing Fantasy #15, Ultimate Spider-Man #1 and Spider-Man 2099's all genetic powers. The updating of the Goblin suit was refreshing, and made perfect sense in the context of the film. Tobey Maguire's performance is inspired, with even greater turns by Willem Dafoe and James Franco (best supporting actor Oscar? Hmm?). And as always, Kirsten Dunst was wonderful. Beautiful AND talented, how rare is THAT?!? The only drawback to this movie is that Sam Raimi has managed to make such a fantastic comic book adaptation, it makes Brian Singer's X-Men and Tim Burton's Batman look kind of weak. This is the new standard people. Is it Shakespeare? No. Is is Gone With The Wind? No. Is it Empire Strikes Back? No. What it is, however, is the MOST entertaining film I've seen in years-- and THAT is what movie making is all about! Bravo Spider-Man cast and crew! Encore!
10.0~Spiderman more Jedi than the Jedi in Clones mrskywalker Sign in Permalink This is a fine film that draws you in with a real story and great action and ideas. Excellent acting especially from the uncle, Goblin, aunt, and even the Newspaper Editor. Durnst was the young girl also in Jumanji and it is interesting to see her older here. Interestingly, this film grabs at the ideas of Luke Skywalker from the old Starwars and is not ashamed of it. This film even seemed to satisfy most of the usual hecklers and people who laugh at all the wrong times at so many movies. Also, many people leaving the new Star Wars mentioned that Spiderman is a better movie. We really wanted Star Wars to be great. Spiderman has a strong plot line but does not skip the characters either. I look forward to the sequel.
8.0~Deserved more rating tweettweetnst Sign in Permalink What a funny rating . This movie deserved at least 8.1
10.0~A winner for the web-spinner! Bill-478 Sign in Permalink This movie is a winner. I've been a Spider-man fan since 1966 and I've been waiting for this movie for a long time. The story, the treatment, the presentation are all things Spider-man fans and movie fans alike will enjoy and appreciate. I recommend this movie to everybody, spidey-fan or not.
4.0~Typical blockbuster - OK effects, poor acting, dire script... Ampa Sign in Permalink After all the hype - what a disappointment... the script is slow & boring, the characterization utterly unbelievable, even the effects are nothing special. Sadly an all too typical story in the genre that we laughingly call the 'summer blockbuster'.
10.0~Spider-Man babydolljessica Sign in Permalink Spider-Man (2002) Is A Great Movie. Tobey Maguire Is An Amazing Spider-Man Kirsten Dunst Is A Good Mary Jane. Rosemarry Harris Is A Good Aunt May. And The Villian. William Dafoe As Green Goblin Is Scary And A Good Match For Spidey. James Franco Was Awesome As Harry. Uncle Ben's Death Scene Was So Sad. When Peter Is Testing Out His Powers Was So Cool. The Fight With Flash Was Cool. And The Final Battle Oh My Gosh So Amazing! The Spider-Man Suit Is So Awesome! When Norman Reveals He Is Green Goblin Is Sad. And Then Peter Dodges The Glider And It Stabs Norman and his last words "Don't Tell Harry." Oh My Gosh. And Then Peter Decides Not To Be With MJ. And The Little Carnival Fight Was Awesome! I Love Spider-Man
9.0~A game changer andresromerocompain Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is Fantastic, though this movie may be dated a little it still holds up as a great movie. The pacing is superb, the acting is great, the characters are fun and entertaining, the score is excellent,it's beautifully shot, really entertaining and creative, and has such a fascinating style by making fun of how stupid and over the top this movie while at the same time using that over the top ness to its advantage to be funny and have meaning. It's more charmingly cartoonish in that sense. Really the best part about the movie is Willem Dafoe's amazing performance and the character of Peter Parker, Willem Dafoe plays a really good villain how has an interesting motivation and intimidating which is something every good villain should be, and Peter Parker is by far the best character in the movie who really brings Spider-Man to life by being a really likable, dorky and fun character who always did the right thing and who is an incredibly flawed and relatable which is everything a hero should be. Essentially it feels like a really over the top story told with masterful presentation and changed the game for superhero movies, and i believe it's a great movie for what it is.
8.0~Thwip! Howlord Sign in Permalink Being a semi-retired comic fan, I highly anticipated this movie. When it was first announced I was skeptical, but as I heard more I became excited. Sam "Evil Dead" Raimi was the perfect director for the material. Tobey Maguire seemed to be the perfect Parker and Willem Dafoe was near the top of my list for favorite candidates for the Green Goblin. I became quite excited for it, but not TOO excited. Did the movie meet me expectations? Yes. It was very good, but not fantastic. The movie was very true to the comic with a few exceptions (no web shooters, skipping Gwen Stacey). The acting was quite strong from everyone involved, especially James Franco who manages to make Harry an incredibly likable guy without much screen time. The characters FELT like they did in the comic which was very important. The effects were completely "buyable" despite some complaints I've heard about them around the web. Danny Elfman's score, while not as good as his previous comic book efforts on "Batman" was strong support, if not memorable. The final fight sequence was also a little disappointingly a "I beat you until you look beaten, you beat me until I look beaten" affair. Given the level of style and the fact that these characters can soar through the air and all the agility at Spidey's disposal, this was a bit anticlimactic. One problem I had with the movie was the some of the dialogue, was REALLY awful. Some of Mary Jane and Peter's lines to each other felt like pre-written gushy letters rather than lines that people are speaking at the spur of the moment. Spidey didn't make as many witty comments as he did in the book either. The highlight of the writing definitely has to be the way that Harry Osborn was written. In some ways he was the most likable character in the movie, and if the movie series goes the same way as the comics do with his character, well I won't reveal what might happen for those who didn't read the comic in the early 1990s. All in all a fun effort and a great success by Raimi and all involved. 8/10
9.0~Strongly illuminates difference between good and evil Geordie-4 Sign in Permalink I enjoyed this film a lot because it hearkens back to the fundamental differences between heroes and villains-their morality. The Green Goblin and Spiderman are very different in this film. The Green Goblin is a very thoughtless, callous murderer while Spiderman could not be more sincere and considerate. Neither character is drawn in varying shades of grey. They are black and white, night and day, yin and yang. So when they battle, one feels compelled to root for the good guy as the bad guy has no redeeming qualities. I think the credit for this should go to the writers and director Sam Raimi who allow the difference in morality to usher the story towards its inevitable showdown between good and evil. Willem Dafoe steals the show here, but once again, Tobey Maguire successfully conveys anger at the evil in the world, his desire to impress Mary Jane Watson (Kirstin Dunst), and his excitement at having such amazing powers. One feels that the only thing keeping this film from being an old Spiderman comic strip are the "Bam Pow Slam" captions.
10.0~Great movie! sdmig Sign in Permalink I saw this opening day and I must say this movie exceeded all my expectations. It followed the story very well. Tobey did an awesome job as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, and Kirsten Dunst was surprisingly fit for her role. William Defoe portrayed the Green Goblin to complete perfection; he has a great wicked smirk that worked so well for his part. When it came to CGI I have to say They pulled it off very well. It wasn't overused (to a point where it got old.) They used real people as often as possible it seemed. Certain shots, of course could not be done without CGI. The models had a very lifelike movement to them; I'm guessing they used real actors for setup. Although some shots seem impossible to use real actors for. They all had fluid motion, worked well in the scene and didn't stand out at all. I give this movie a 10/10! Its great fun and a job well done. This is by far the best comic to movie I've seen since Batman.
8.0~Good movie! albee07 Sign in Permalink Spiderman was far better than what i expected because i was getting a little weary of these super hero movies about a man getting hit upside the head with a radioactive skillet or drinking some milk that just happened to be contaminated with special powers. Tobey Maguire does a good job with providing the Peter Parker character with the innocence and kidness that gives him his great qualities. I enjoyed veteran actor Wilem Defoe as the Green Goblin even though the mask wasn't needed since Defoe already looks like the Goblin. Kirsten Dunst was hot as hell and she got the biggest nipples in the world! But overall Spiderman was a good timeless movie with sublime acting and fight sequences that are mind blowing. I give it a 4 out of 5
10.0~fantastic mosslisa Sign in Permalink What a fantastic film to watch the special effects were brillant the film was griping from the start and the actors had so much chemsistry between them it was very real. Tobey Maguire played both Peter Parker and Spider man brillantly a film id watch over and over again.
4.0~Disappointing koliokolev Sign in Permalink **Spoilers mainly** The disappointing thing for me was that actually I'd read several comments comparing Spiderman to X-men. Spiderman is not even near X-men, in anything. The cast is terrible, the acting is missing, there is no plot at all, the special effects are obsolete. I thought I was watching a 70s movie. Star Wars had much better special effects, and was made 30 years ago. No character development (how can missing characters have character developnment anyway), the behavior of the heroes is unpredictable and not based on reason, not interesting, not exciting.... If you have two hours to kill, it's better than just staring at the ceiling though. 4/10
9.0~At last a Spider-Man movie! LuboLarsson Sign in Permalink Spider-Man the Movie seems to have taken forever to hit the big screen, but it was worth the wait as Sam Raimi has delivered a great film, with great performances by Tobey Maguire and the beautiful Kirsten Dunst. I even remember the cheesy 70's TV series of Spiderman, but this one does the web slinger much more justice with state of the art special effects that look truly amazing, but the film is much more than just eye candy, it has soul too. I still think Superman the Movie is the best comic book adaption ever made but this is a very close second. Perhaps its unfair to compare the two characters though, because Spider-Man is human whilst Superman isn't, plus Superman was from the childhood and holds a special place in my heart, I watched Spider-Man as an adult and thoroughly enjoyed it, I think the vast army of fans haven't been let down. ***9/10***
7.0~Entertaining - mostly; cringe-worthy - occassionally; but never brilliant blaircam Sign in Permalink This film was quite enjoyable but some of the 'romantic' scenes were bordering on execrable. I struggled to understand why more viewers weren't vomitting at these nauseatingly puerile teen wannabes. Dunst's character was far from the classic hero's love-interest. She was closer to the town bicycle, stumbling from one partner to another at a pace that would make the 'Sex and the City' girls cringe. The action, what there was of it, was entertainly and slickly rendered (for the most part) but was really all too predictable and the obvious sequel ending avaricious in the extreme. All in all I struggle to understand how this film can be running at the vote that it currently is - except that it is a sad indictment on the movie-makers and watchers! My vote - a kind 7/10.
10.0~An action movie that stays true to your childhood image. Thekat1961-1 Sign in Permalink There is not one person who when reading comic books as a child did not want to be a superhero. I was one of those children. My superhero of choice was SPIDERMAN! Along with millions of other children. I have waited 30 years for Spidey to make it to the big screen and it was well worth the wait. I had the great fortune to win four tickets to the premiere of this movie and took my three sons ages 11,8,and 6. They are all avid Spiderman fans. The movie was exactly what all of the Spidey fans wanted. One that was true to the original and was pure escapist entertainment for a few hours. Just like a comic book. The acting was not Academy award winning but good enough. Tobey Macguire played the confused Angst-ridden Peter Parker well and Willem Defoe's Green Goblin was well done. One thing that I was glad to see kept from the comic was the humor. The script has many memorable oneliners for both Spidey and the green goblin. As for how my children reacted to the violence the 11 and 8 year old no problems. The six year old did ask me several times if the green goblin was just a man in a mask?. So go see it and enjoy yourself for a few hours and remember what it was like to hold that new comic book of your favorite superhero when you were a kid.
9.0~Weave yourself into a comfy web and enjoy Dia Klain Sign in Permalink Spiderman: a true comic book hero brought alive. A movie that delivers the action but does not take itself too seriously while it's at it. Where cheesy love lines and predictable action sequences are enjoyable and awaited rather then shunned. One problem I have with many modern superhero movies is that they totally lose the idea of `kid entertainment brought to life' and instead try to pull off some sort of Matrix. This is one of the problems I found in X Men. It took itself excessively seriously. There was absolutely no hummer in the movie what so ever. Where humor was to be expected one found heavy drama. Spiderman, on the other hand, felt like a cartoon, just with real people. The fake look of the Green Goblin was amusing, as was the swing of the Spiderman from building to towering building. This is for those Spiderman fans out there, the new and the old, this is NOT for someone in love with Blade II; they would probably do better with The Scorpion King. Know who you are and do not complain about this movie if you not be caught dead watching the cartoon or reading the comics. The one comment I have is that it failed to explain what powers the Green Goblin had, other then that, the movie satisfied me perfectly. Wonderful acting.
3.0~Drivel Stranger-on-the-Train Sign in Permalink This is easily the worst comic-book adaptation I have ever seen. I didn't even make it through to the end. Painful. The visual effects and action sequences were pretty good. Apart from Defoe, the acting was painful, the dialogue was worse, and the love story was sickening. You would think that a boy who became a spider-man would have a bit of a dark side, or have a little trouble adapting to this new life. What do we get? "Oh well. I guess I'd better make a costume..." Pathetic. Any stars I gave this movie were for Bruce Campbell.
10.0~Great movie. kyle-mcdonald Sign in Permalink This is one of my favorite spider man movies because it has lots of action it has a good screen play for it Tobey plays a great spider man in this movie also it his first time and he does it great. The acting in it is good and the actors in it are good it has a good sense of humor in it. The villains in it are good i think that Willem Defoe does a great green goblin in this spider man movie. So i'm sure that you will not be disappointed with this movie spider man. So make sure that you rent or buy spider man because it is really good. Overall score ********** out of ********** ***** out of *****
10.0~Amazing And Spectacular aesgaard41 Sign in Permalink It was a long time coming, but the long overdue Spiderman movie just may be a success. The plot is not what I expected, though, I pictured something a bit more darker and set closer to the real world as the first Batman movie. The film sets up Peter as the comic book did, as a social outcast constantly demeaned and embarrassed by his peers. Do we need to be reminded of how horrible high school was for all of us ? the origins could have been summed up in a few flashback sequences in a dream. As it is, the movie has a long set-up and once it gets started, it becomes a bit dizzying from the acrobatic sequences, but the viewer does get used to them. The computer imaging seamlessly works excellantly that soon it becomes hard to tell what is done real and what was done on computer. Tobey McGuire does a great job playing Peter, but his Spiderman is a little distant, not so much on the wise-cracking hero from the comics. Kirsten Dunst is titillating as MJ Watson (personally, I saw Kate Winslet in the role), but she does provide more substance and character than seen in the comics. Willem DaFoe out-Jokers Nicholson as the Green Goblin and out-Psychos Anthony Perkins as Norman Osborn. James Franco also gives a wonderful performance as does Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris (I thought Aunt May looked more like Cheers' Frances Sternhagen). Kudos to JK Simmons for actually looking like JJJ and giving the role a comic edge. The direction is excellant and the photography is superb. This movies deserves nothing less than a ten from anyone who has never seen the comic.
2.0~Not so good kilroy55 Sign in Permalink The biggest problem with this movie is the length of the film. It is long and boring. The story doesn't pick up till well after the first hour. Too much background information that doesn't help the story along one bit. Then comes the acting, which was horrible. Willem Defoe who usually is so wonderful is god awful in this film. He uses a raspy and very laughable voice to try and sound evil, which i didn't buy one bit. Then the action sequences, which were all computer generated images that looked like computer generated images. No stunts whatsoever by a stunt man were required of this film. I am not a spider-man comic reader, so i had no love or bias going into this film. Spider-man was boring and i found myself staring at my watch waiting for the movie to be over. Save your money on this one and wait for it to come out on video, then just rent it for one viewing. Trust me you will not want to watch it more than once.
9.0~Spider-Man is the best super hero ever tjw1973 Sign in Permalink I can't say enough great things about this movie. Spider-Man is the greatest of all the Super hero movies. It is a very human picture with many of the characters in a grey zone where they have great redeeming qualities and as well as inner demons. The only character's immune are Peter's Aunt and Uncle, because they are the first glimpse of the super heroes conscience. It is a much lighter picture than the Batman movies in that Peter Parker/Spiderman is not nearly as conflicted as Bruce Wayne and has had a family. There is much genuine humor in the film that anyone can relate to because it is based on real human situations even if we are witnessing a superhero deal with them on screen in a fantasy world. I'd say this is the movie of the summer (well almost..read further), and I'd give Toby McGuire an Oscar for his ability to carry this film on his shoulder. He is SPIDERMAN. I hope that the producers keep him through the sequels a la superman because after seeing this film, no one else could be spiderman. This film is my choice for 2nd best of the summer. I can't give it first place because I'm a Star Wars fanatic, but if this was a non Star Wars year it would be #1. 9 out of 10
7.0~Not bad, but not incredible digitalbeachbum Sign in Permalink This is a good solid movie for an attempt at sticking to the original feel of Peter Parker and Spiderman. I am a huge fan of Spiderman and it was the #1 comic I collected for ten years in my youth. No other comic had such a profound influence on me. The acting was very acceptable but I do not think that the casting of Tobey Maguire was the best choice. He is not what I expected for a Peter Parker although I think he made a valiant effort. Sam Raimi did a good job as a director and I believe he really captured the look and feel of the environment of the big city. I liked the camera work on the web swinging too. The best actor in this version of the JK Simmons as JJ Jameson. Honorable mention goes to Cliff Robertson who I thought was supposed to be a heavier looking man. I believe that Green Goblin was good, but I was a little thrown off by Willem Dafoe as Normon Osborn. My vision of Osborn was short curly hair and I believe this would have completed the transformation for Willem Dafoe. Great special effects. Awesome direction. Good acting. FX 1 Direction 1 Acting 1 Villain .5 Set Design 1 Attempt at keeping original storyline 10 14.5 of 6
10.0~The best superhero move EVER! rcdouglas Sign in Permalink Superman was camp. Batman was very close to the original intent behind the World's Greatest Detective. But Spider-Man hits all marks. What the director understood is that this wasn't a story about Spider-Man; it was and continues to be a story about Peter Parker. Kirsten Dunst barely holds on as Mary Jane, but she pulls it out in the end. Willem Dafoe is great as the Green Goblin, but his costume disappoints. (Why have that rigid mask? Dafoe's unmasked facial contortions were terrific--makeup would have been a better choice.) Aunt May was believable (as was Uncle Henry), but not quite as frantic as she needed to be. The movie handles the origin story pretty well. It skips Gwen, but needed to in order to tell a 15-year story in 90-or-so minutes. Also, the webs shooting from his wrists (instead of from a wrist device) was new, but actually an improvement. (How did a high school kid invent those things, anyway?) Watch, and cheer. And look to the sequel.
7.0~Good, but could have been better nomer10 Sign in Permalink Ahh Spiderman. Could this movie live up to it's potential? Well in my opinion sort of. One of the stronger points in the movie, which you don't see in many comic book/fantasy text to theater translations is the emphasis on the on the background of the charecters. That was not so in this film. Im not going to get into specifics, but the transition was well done. On acting. I believe Toby Maguire did an excellent job portraying Peter Parker, perfect for that role. Then on the other hand as spiderman you are probably wondering if he would suit that position. Well in my opinion he really didnt need to. The role of spiderman was more of stunts and computer generated sequences, so in the end it works out for his part. William Dafoe, couldn't have picked a better person to play green goblin, his voice, his facial expressions. Perfect. Now Kirsten Dunst, I didn't really picture her as the MJ type, and I'm still not really sure if she was really the best one for the job. She did, on the other hand, do a decent job. The action scenes were alright. Just alright. At times the enviorment was so visibly computer generated, it felt as if I was watching a cartoon and really took away from the feeling of the scene. This isn't the most detailed review because it's intended for people that haven't seen the movie and want to get a general idea of what it's like. I wouldn't go there expectiong the world, but it's definitely worth seeing. 7/10
9.0~Sam Raimi has done it again! Evil_Ed_ Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi is definitely back again, with this marvellous movie. I was a bit worried that he'd got 'Hollywood hybris', and therefore made a dull movie, but he still has got the humour that was such large part of the Evil Dead trilogy. One of the best movies I've seen lately (beaten only by Peter Jackson's 'The Lord of the Rings').
9.0~Would you like to swing from the sky? Astralan Sign in Permalink I was never one to read comics when I was young.. or old for that matter, however, I could enjoy the way this interpretation of Spiderman thoroughly enjoying. I had a few complaints, but only once really sticks in my mind that really is becoming more prevalent in today's movies and more specifically blockbuster moves: Lack of acting. Maybe it's the actor or actress. Maybe it's the director holding on too much, but the only actor which really outshined everyone else's character was the editor, Jamison. He barked, he glared, he sneered, he punned, he was ANIMATED in a way only a HAM can animate a character. I really, truly felt that if Sam Ramie had allowed that to perpetrate all his characters, I would have considered myself fully entertained. But this first blockbuster of the year is really setting a hopeful precedence on this year.
7.0~Well-done doesn't equal good TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews Sign in Permalink I'm not saying I'm easy to please. And I will admit that this is well-produced. I won't go over everything in this that's potentially bothersome. They do get a lot in there, including the main point of the character. J. Jonah Jameson is perfect. May and Ben are pretty good. Maguire isn't satisfactory in my opinion, as either part of the role, though he is not as bad as he could be. Mary Jane is OK. The Osborns are fairly accurate. Dafoe's performance does bring up something important about this film, however; there's a lot of ham and camp in this. Perhaps not enough to turn a meat-eater vegan, or make you call your parents and beg to come pick you up, but it still gets to be *painful* at times. Also, the comedy... is it meant to be funny? It almost invariably isn't. The effects are generally nice-looking, although that whole thing about the actual costume of Spidey looking just like the CGI version... yes, and that's because it always looks fake, so it appears, in spite of that not being the case, as if every time we see the hero, he's animated. Plot is fine, and as an origin story, this certainly gets the job done. Pacing is reasonable. The action is cool enough, and the cinematography and editing are inventive and creative. Overall, this ought to please most of the audience, casual viewer and fan alike. There is a little potentially disturbing content. The DVD has TV spots, trailers, music videos, a comic/feature comparison, four special tracks for the movie, one with webisodes, a pop-up factoid one and two commentary tracks, one with Raimi and producers, and the other with VFX people, and finally the option to record one of your own. I recommend this to those it appeals to. 7/10
10.0~"With great power, comes great responsibility." Angelus2 Sign in Permalink Peter Parker is bit by a spider and in turn he receives the powers of a spider...But after living his life on the side-lines, Peter begins to enjoy the perks that come with super powers; until tragedy strikes and Peter learns that with 'Great Power Comes Great Responsibility.'. The cast all do a tremendous job in bringing the Spiderman world to life. The give the comic book characters depth, emotions and a voice that reaches out beyond the screen. What I loved more was 'Spiderman' the suit was amazing and cinematography was even greater as it brought the comic book world forth. I felt that the fight scene could have been much better, but was satisfied with Sam Raimi's take on this beloved comic book legend.
1.0~This is not worth seeing chanel_chicke Sign in Permalink This movie had promising previews and I heard many good things about it. In reality the movie was not well made or put together. The love story did not even appear real. The acting also needed a lot of work. If you haven't seen it yet I wouldn't recommend it.
9.0~The best comic-to-film ever!!! supertom-3 Sign in Permalink Spiderman has come to the big screen after decades of wait. We've had Spidy appear in comics, cartoons and some more low profile movies but his exploits have never lit up the big screen, until now. This movie had to produce the goods, not just for Spiderman fans but for movie goers in general. It successfully brings to life one of the most popular comic characters ever and is definitely the best film of this year and in my opinion the best comic to film movie ever made, even better than Batman. What makes this better than most other effects movies is that it combines special effects wizardry with a good movie itself, what I mean is if you look at Star wars episode 2, take away the amazing effects and the movie is trash. Spiderman like Lord of the Rings is a great movie. It combines a good plot and interesting characters, and also has great performances. The film is very much like a comic book brought to life, it doesn't take itself to seriously and in Peter Parker we have a relatable hero who is likeable and suitably vulnerable. Unlike your typical action film with Schwarzenegger et al, we have a human, 3 dimensional character. The cast are all good and are a large factor in the success of the film. Toby McGuires casting as Peter Parker/Spidy had quite a debate amongst Spiderman fanatics as to whether he was the right man for the job. I, and most fans will agree his casting was perfection. McGuire holds the screen and plays the part superbly. The character is also, like the comic, complex. Spiderman's actions have consequences even when he is doing good. He has conflicting emotions and as his uncle Ben says `with great power comes great responsibility'. It is an interesting part of the film, Spiderman can't do anything without different repercussions, just as in real life. For example, Peter Parker enters a wrestling competition and wins (beating none other than the Macho Man Randy Savage) he expects to win $3000 but is only given $100. When the organiser is robbed, Parker has a chance to stop the criminal but lets him go to get back at the organiser. Later that same criminal car jacks Peters uncle and shoots him in the process, killing him. Its scenes like this that add depth to the character and make you get behind him, and there are more examples particularly towards the end. Also very good in the film, in a similarly likeable character is the lovely Kirsten Dunst playing Mary Jane. She is excellent, she's charming, sweet and very pretty. Basically Dunst is playing the character to perfection. Mary Jane, like Peter, is faithfully recreated. Willem Defoe stars as the Green Goblin and his alter ego, scientist and entrepreneur, Norman Osborn. He is suitably menacing in the guise of the Green Goblin and plays the troubled Osborn equally as well. James Franco is also good as Osborn's son and friend of Peter. The action scenes are very good. With some great effects. Spiderman swings through the city and the camera swoops along with him to a vertigo inducingly brilliant affect. Sam Raimi's free flowing camera adds the perfect style to this film and he seems to have been made to direct the film. It's always exciting and importantly is well paced. Like most films that are effects based there is the odd moment where the effects look a bit off but that rarely happens and doesn't spoil the film. The movie is great, combining elements that make a great popcorn movie and elements that make a great film. It has a great cast, great action, a good story and a brilliant score from Danny Elfman. The film seems at times seems like a cross between Darkman and Batman, combining what made them great and adding to that. Overall it is the best film I've seen since Lord of the Rings and gets a well deserved 9/10
10.0~A Rare Treat! Spider-man delivers in blockbuster proportions with Great Acting,Romance, and Special Effects! nimrod65 Sign in Permalink Its rare nowadays to find a gem of a film that critics, kids,parents, teenagers, girls, guys,blacks,whites, and just about anyone can sit together and watch. This Film Is It! Not only does it stay perfectly true to the comic book, but its stars deliver with another solid performance for Tobey McGuire and 2 outstanding all-star performances from kirsten dunst and the great Willem Defoe, whow as born to play the green goblin. Not one single person will walk out of the theater after seeing this movie! a true delight when swearing and blood and gore are kept to a low and a movie still delivers a knock-out punch! Big ups to bruce cambell(evil dead) as the ring announcer and to director sam raimi for another fine film! jason bell
8.0~Good movie with scenes connected by flawed and boring links Winds_of_Destination Sign in Permalink Since the 80's, I believe, Spider-Man has been trying over and over again to hit the silver screen. James Cameron got close, writing a script for the movie but the idea was thrown out. Spidey material sat silent in the dust for 8 years before Sam Raimi picked it up. The first 45 minutes are near flawless. There were some forgettable scenes (GG attacking some air force base), and the whole wrestling scene was ridiculous, but it was all a build-up to the defining moment in Peter Parker's history; his Uncle Ben gets shot, and he seeks revenge immediately. And through this he learns the true meaning of "With great power comes great responsibility". The second act begins right after he avenges his uncle's death. He soon becomes Spider-Man and begins to pursue the girl of his dreams, Mary Jane. Spider-Man has given him confidence, but things aren't so great for the hero for long. A new menace is on the scene, going by the moniker Green Goblin, and he has a fight- actually three- to pick with Spider-Man. His first fight is entertaining, his second a bore, and his third a cinematic marvel. He is played by the cunning Willem Dafoe, who gives a very credible role in this film. All the performances of course, are good. Tobey Maguire does a great job as the heroic webslinger, doing justice for the emotional scenes and giving a sense of triumph in the red tights. James Franco is equally good, although he only has a couple of cameos as Peter's best friend. His final scene is promising. Kirsten Dunst does a good job as well as Rosemary Harris and Cliff Roberston. Every character is believable and fun to watch, whether it be on the silver screen or on your TV. This movie is flawed though. While still managing greatly on the entertainment level, some of the bigger scenes can only be shown by introducing a new storyline, and it is usually done through a boring scene (Spidey's second fight with GG leads to something I don't want to say as to not spoil the film). There are plenty of scenes that are entirely forgettable, but each one leads to something more important, something bigger. The main highlight, though, is the final battle at the end, composed of two major scenes. Both are spectacular (the Queensboro Bridge and GG vs. Spidey in the old warehouse) and do wonders for the film's presentation and credibility. And it is only followed by a great ending, leaving you wanting to watch it again. Spider-Man is the promising opening of a good trilogy (would've said great if Spider-Man 3 wasn't part of that trilogy), and I give it a 7.2/10.
10.0~ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER!!!! Bruno_Malta Sign in Permalink Just saw Spider Man and let me tell you, i walked out of the cinema with tears in my eyes. I have been a fan of Spider man for 21 years now. I have all his comics, cartoons and everything else you might ask. When the movie was anounced i get excited but the trailer let me down a bit. But i was not prepared for what i would experience.... Tobey Maguire is a perfect Spider Man and delivers a good show to our eys. Willian Dafoe kicks some major ass as the evil Green Goblin and Kirsten Dunst gets pretty well as Mary Jane. The rest of the cast does also a good job. Sure, there are some minor diferences to the comics but nothing that would spoil the pleasure of a long time Spider man fan. I give it a 10....the best movie and experience that i had in my life...Let the sequel come!!!!
8.0~best comic book movie of all-time gallagwar Sign in Permalink what can't i say about this movie. as a big spider-man buff, i was almost brought to tears by how well this movie matched the comic book. as a movie buff, i was captivated by how brilliant the film was as a whole. it was purposely cheesy at parts (i.e. goblin screaming "WE'LL MEET AGAIN!"), had a strong wit, and was vibrant and full of color. tobey maguire has always been a favorite of mine, and he didn't disappoint, playing the perfect shy, calm character that peter parker is. they couldn't have picked a better face than willem dafoe for the green goblin. and i've always loved kirsten dunst for numerous reasons. the only comic book movie that ever compared was the original batman. but i think with batman, people blew it up because of the sheer star power of the movie. taking nothing away from maguire, dafoe, and dunst, this movie didn't need a star-studded cast to capture the audience. they just nailed every little detail that brought the comic book to life. they didn't try to make it realistic like x-men, and they didn't try to make it overly-dramatic like superman. where all other comic book movies tried to be movies first, and capture the essense of the comic book second, this movie took everything right from the pages and put them onto the screen. i can't wait for the sequel (there will so be one) where he takes on the lizard (he mentioned dr. connors in the movie), venom, doc octopus, or whoever. it will be great.
4.0~Good, but........... gritfrombray-1 Sign in Permalink Having been a Spidey fan for over 30 years and a magazine collection for the last 149 months, amongst many before, I had real high expectations of this movie. The story of how Peter got his powers and his family life were perfect. The loving home and a very well cast Uncle Ben and Aunt May was superb. Even Flash Thompson was brilliant! The one thing that makes a superhero movie is not just a believable hero, but a believable bad guy. Willem Dafoe was horribly cast as Norman Osbourne. The guy is wimpy, small and just not frightening. Norman in the cartoons is tall, well built and super intelligent, married with the fact that the serum makes him mad makes him a very interesting character. All this nonsense of 'voices' talking to Norman was never in the original story. Speaking of original stories, where was Gwen Stacy? I believe she's in the third. Next complaint, Mary Jane. Kirsten Dunst did not suit the part. Mary Jane is supposed to be a strikingly beautiful supermodel and actress. Kirsten is neither..... All in all a disappointment but the second was superb!
6.0~Just for some fun. That's it! elturco99 Sign in Permalink A funny movie, that's all. But it fails to reach visual standards of some peers like "Lord of the Rings". Especially, running on roofs scenes were quite alike very-old fashioned pc-game "prince". I dont think the animators could manage to do a great stuff. What they did is to complete the lags between the scenes by third class visual effects. Ok i admit! spiderman's swinging with his cobweb in New York streets was more successful than his run on the roofs! (and actually that's pretty logical, given that there are walls on the roof!huh!) Everything else were ok! but that's it.. nothing spectacular at all!
5.0~Over hyped, over long and poorly written chad_jorgenson Sign in Permalink Spider-Man starts off well, Tobey Maguire does a great job as Peter Parker and Kirsten Dunst does her best with Mary Jane's role, although it is poorly written.Willem Defoe seems to be enjoying himself, if nothing else and kudos must go to the actor who plays J. Jonah Jameson as he delivers the best performance of the movie. The first shots of Spider-Man swinging through New York seem promising even if the CGI is a little rough in comparison to Star Wars, and Spider-Man's first confrontation with a car-jacker is played out fairly well. In the second half of the movie however, things go from good to bad to awful. The CGI of the fight scenes is laughable, with the Green Goblin in particular looking like . Plot holes start springing up all over the place until they are impossible to ignore and begin to seriously detract from the experience. The worst is saved for last however as the film is saddled with the most pathetic final showdown I have seen in a movie for quite awhile, with zero suspense and barely any action. Not what you want from a super-hero movie. Finally, to add insult to injury, Sam Raimi sees fit to end the film with a romantic scene so bad that it makes Attack of the Clones' romance seem positively Shakespearean. A mediocre movie at best.
10.0~A Classic and Masterpiece Bradboy1029 Sign in Permalink Throughout the years, several movies have flopped and died out. Like Daredevil, Fantastic Four, Batman and Robin. But throughout these years, a popular modern-day classic comes that will live on for the rest of peoples lives. Movies like this never die out, no matter if a person really doesn't like it. Spider-Man is a classic. I don't think a single remake will match the magic of Spider-Man. This movie, Spider-Man has been a classic ever since its release. Movies like this never come out anymore. Movies suck today. Spider-Man is one of the movies that made us wonder why we like movies in the first place. Batman Begins has to be the only super hero movie I liked besides this one. They are actually both classics. 10/10 for Batman Begins. And 10/10 for Spider-Man (2002)
9.0~The best superhero movie yet. JamesMetal1 Sign in Permalink This Movie was much better than I expected. At first I didn't think that Tobey Maguire would be a good Spider Man, but after I saw the movie, I thought " Wow! This guy is good." Kirsten Dunst has gotta come back in the sequel as M.J. No one else has that kind of real-life Mary Jane look. Plus, I've been a fan of Kirsten's for a while. I've seen Bring it On, Small Soldiers, Jumanji, and Drop Dead Gorgeous. She's great. Spider-Man is much better than the bat and the man of steel. I've never really liked Superman. Not to put it down, but I like batman much better. Although Spider-Man blows them all away. I can't wait to play the game as well as get it on DVD.
7.0~If only... The Spectacular Spider-Man Sign in Permalink The whole point of Spider-Man is what would happen if a real person was a superhero? What if a superhero really existed? In real life? What if there was a superhero, not a Kryptonian in fictional Metropolis, but a real kid in New York? The suit used in the movie just emphasised the fact that the film was a typical superhero movie. It's a given that superheroes in films have cool costumes; Batman, Spawn, the X-Men, etc. So Spidey followed this, as the audience expected. But the whole point is that Peter can't make a cool, high-tech costume because he doesn't have the resources or the means. He's just a kid, doing what he can. If Spider-Man actually existed, he would look like the Nicolas Hammond 1970's TV version. A cheap, garish and silly costume (in the comics, Spidey's costume was often criticised) is exactly what Spidey originally wore in the comics and so wore in the TV show, and would wear in real life. The cheap costume is endearing. It shows this average guy is doing his best to be a superhero, trying his hardest with the little he has. We can all relate to it, as it's about as good as the average person could do, no better. I feel if the director Sam Raimi and co had been brave enough to make a film of the Spidey concept (a superhero in real life, cheap costume and all) and not try and animate comicbook panels, then we'd really be onto something.
4.0~didn't expect much and thats just what i got joelally Sign in Permalink There is really nothing to this movie. Its popularity and rating are based on previous material. If this were to be the first appearance of Spider Man this movie would not be getting half of the attention. This movie was boring mindless and big waste of time. Acting: a huge step down for all those involved (most obviously Dafoe and Maguire) Directing: I've never like Sam Raimi, but there was some good stuff here though the only real memorable part would be Spider-Man swinging from building to building, other than that pretty straight forward. Script: a whole lot of nothing. The love triangle was ridiculous and all of your corny conventional stuff is there. Music: Danny Elfman...by far the best part of the movie. The Ending: couldn't tell you, I fell asleep Rating: 4 of 10 (for moments of interesting directing and Elfman's music) The way I see it (and I am by no means a fan of the action/superhero genre) there hasn't been a worthwhile superhero movie since Burton's Batman movies. Those had style and darkness, Raimi's movie is like watching a commercial.
8.0~A great adaptation of one of the most famous superheroes. johnnymacbest Sign in Permalink I remember seeing the trailers for this film and I thought: WOW!!! They really pulled off a believable Spider-Man film that does justice to the spirit of the comics and character. Spider-Man is a film that audiences young and old to enjoy, with it's dazzling action sequences, humorous lines and a well-written and exciting plot. Sam Raimi, known for his cult "Evil Dead" films and the underrated but brilliant "Darkman" gives the character so much in traits and personality, wit, that it's hard to imagine anyone else that can deliver a Spider-Man film. More often than not, I think this film is a great example how much hard work and devotion is done to make sure that this film is a success. True, some of the shots seem artificial, but what viewers should really focus on is the story and characters, something that moviegoers sometimes fail to do. And with a script like this, you will be too. Like Richard Donner's "Superman" another film done right, Spider-Man spends a considerable time on the origins of Peter Parker, who is motivated to use his powers for good due to a tragedy in his life. But whereas Superman was brought up to do good by his parents and the values he learned on his time on Earth, Spider-Man was struck by circumstance, both by his surroundings and his personal tragedy. These characters are completely different from each other. But what makes Spider-Man so compelling than Superman is that he's an average, ordinary guy with everyday problems that one day becomes blessed(and to a certain extent, cursed) with an extraordinary gift. His reaction is that of joy and excitement that is shared by everyone in this world when they find themselves doing extraordinary actions. Though not in no way in the context of the real world, but the point still stands. And lets face it we all like to be superheroes some day. Spider-Man gives us the feeling of living out those fantasies in more ways than one. To make a great superhero film, or any film for that matter, you have to have strong actors and Tobey Maguire is by far the best choice for the film. He's really believable as a guy who is shunned by his pears but still is kind-heart and meek, bright. You grow to care for Peter, Mary Jane, Aunt May, Uncle Ben, and Norman Osborne. When a film makes you care for the characters, then you know it's good. As for the action scenes, they are thrilling, exciting, and at times, very brutal. Even though Spider-Man is a bit light-hearted and fun, it can be really intense and scary, which parents ought to be cautious when seeing these films with their children. But despite all this, Spider-Man is still good fun. Now that a reboot is being planned, I'm very excited to see what's next for the Web-Slinger even though I enjoyed the first film along with the second(which I will review later on). The less said about Spidey 3 the better, but Spider-Man is the best one ever made and the sequel is pure magic as a film that surpasses the first one by far.
7.0~A great movie that turned horribly wrong ! Shivster Sign in Permalink Out-of-place sappy dialogue spoils many a movie and this truly becomes the achilles heel of what would have been a really nice adrenalin-rushing (right from the first web-swing! :)) comic-adaptation. Sure you can't make a movie exclusively for the purists out there ... Let me put it this way , if you thought the ending in the Matrix with Carrie Ann Moss was cheesy and that "wake-up, neo!" kiss totally uncalled for, you're going to nit-pick this movie as much as I did.
8.0~Everyone needs a hero Gryp Sign in Permalink Wow, my first comment, so I'll hopefully make it useful... The audience i saw it with was much younger... most were in high school.. and a lot were cheering and laughing... especially in the parts where Peter Parker sticks up for himself. Sure this movie was quite predictable, and the plot was rather simplified... but everyone needs a hero or someone to look up to. I'm sure every guy was quite happy when Peter discovered the powers from his changing body.. That's why I gave this movie an 8.. special effects were great and they didn't overdo it.. Tobey Maguire did a great job although Kirsten Dunst was not too believable as Mary Jane.. maybe not pretty enough :) Hehe anyways, it's worth your money for sure..
10.0~Amazing and Incredible!! doug_funnie Sign in Permalink Spider-Man is an amazing movie, it is so enjoyable to watch. Anyone who likes good movies or who is a fan of the comic should watch it. Everything about the movie is amazing and there is so much room for a sequel! All the actors are well casted and they do a great job portraying their character. It's visually stunning, the graphics are well done too and the camera angles are incredible, although a lot of the movie is computer graphics it's all realistic. The story itself is very good, nothing gets confusing and everything plays out well in it's place. The only negative thing I could say about it, is that it may be a little violent for younger kids, but no one should miss this if you want to see a good movie!
10.0~This is one of the best movies made in a LONG time... the___force Sign in Permalink I'll say it again: This is one of the best movies made in a LONG, LONG time. Spider-Man has broken practically every box-office record, and unlike the reprehensible Titanic and the recently released Attack of the Clones, it has done so not because of media hype but because it is a genuinely great film in every respect. I'm not going to bore you with long descriptions of what I thought were the strengths and weakness of this movie. Instead, I'm going to provide you with some practical advice that will help you decide whether or not you should see this movie. In general, I have noticed that there are three types of people who REALLY did not like this film and regret paying money to see it: 1) People who believe movies like Batman, Superman and Lord of the Rings (movies that require imagination) are childish nonsense, and cannot take such movies seriously. My parent's were born in India and they pretty much fall into this category. All they are interested in seeing are Indian movies, which are basically poorly acted soap operas. Don't bother taking very young children (7 or younger) to see this film. I've already watched it three times, and each time I noticed that most of the younger kids in the audience did not have the patience to sit through the film, let alone appreciate it. 2) People who are so cynical and jaded that any movie that does not feature sex or drugs, and that actually tries to promote moral values like loyalty, self-sacrifice and responsibility, are automatically thrown into the "simplistic crap" category. 3) People who cannot stand traditional romance and prefer the usual "We've just met, let's sleep with each other" relationships featured in more "complicated" movies. If you don't think you belong to any three of these categories - enjoy!
8.0~Great...Great...Great- Phooey to the Naysayers bobbyf Sign in Permalink I grew up with the Fantastic Four, Spiderman, Batman, and others rolled up and jammed in my back pocket- pages worn after a dozen readings. Seeing these super heroes of my youth come to life on the screen is a true delight. Sam Raimi's "Spiderman" is just that- a pure delight. I think the casting was brilliant. In this film, Tobey McGuire IS Peter Parker, and his journey of discovery - his newfound abilities as Spiderman is wonderful. There are those who will say the story spends too much time on this transformation, but the origins of a superhero are the creamy stuff of the comics. DaFoe is as perfect for the Green Goblin as Nicholson was for the Joker and Dunst is a steamy Mary Jane. Sam Raimi's darker vision brings a more serious tone that lends credibility to the story. I loved this film, and it will go right next to Burton's original "Batman," "Unbreakable," and the first "Superman" film in my collection of superhero film classics.
8.0~Great film adaptation of Spiderman Floated2 Sign in Permalink Spiderman is a very common superhero comic book adaptation turn into movie. I remember precisely when this movie first came out, I was somewhat skeptical about seeing it but I finally gave in and was surprised of how good it was and how faithful it was to the comic book. The story itself is basically how Spider-man came to be. The story starts basically on a field trip Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) gets bit by a radioactive spider and gains powers from the bite. He not only has to struggle with making ends meet he has to struggle with a destructive lunatic called Green Goblin(Willem Dafoe)and also revealing his true feelings about his long-time friend, Mary Jane(Kirsten Dunst). This movie is so true to the comic book, its almost eerie. Tobey Maguire is great as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Willem Dafoe is excellent as The Green Goblin, J.K. Simmons is great as Jonah Jameson and even Aunt May and Uncle Ben are portrayed and acted accurately. The action sequences are pretty good and even though they use CGI its not an eyesore here as it is in other movies that use it heavily. My only gripe is I could do without the weak one-liners that appear once and awhile in the movie. All in all fans of the comic book as well as the cartoon series wont be disappointed. I liked how it seemed and how it connected to those. === As a rewatch 04/01/19' opinions remain relatively same about Spider-Man. Having not watched this film for nearly 8 years, much memory had been forgotten about this film. As it was nice to rewatch this film after watching both TASM (2012) and Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) for sake of comparisons and differences. This Spider-Man is relatively a simply origin story as it does stay true o the comics. The film's pace is at ease and has an enjoyable feel, as well as a turn of emotions. The film isn't too depressing, but is filled with enough joy and fun moments that it makes the end worthwhile. In comparison to TASM, Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker is easier to root for as he is far more likable in a sense where we can see his struggles more clearer. We also see where the chemistry between him and Kirsten Dunst begins, as it folds naturally. The villain of the Green Goblin is a worthy character for a starter villain. The action is well done, there are some decent comic reliefs scenes and the ending does leave us wanting more.
8.0~The Best Superhero Film since Superman II TexasRedge Sign in Permalink Hollywood has always suffered from bad Superhero movies(example:X-Men, Batman Series)however I'm glad to say that this film isn't one of those films. this film is simply splended and good fun. In fact its the best superhero film since Superman II all the way back in 1981. I hope to see a sequel come out soon. I liked the story, I liked the acting, The special effects are good, and the music score is good. this movie hits on all 8 cylinders.- its great! I enjoyed this film alot. This film reminded me of the 1st Superman movie(1978) in several ways, If you like Superhero films this is going to be one of your favorites- I promise you that! I give this film 8 out of 10 stars -- you're gonna like this movie
7.0~It's like watching a live action comic book jmt-18 Sign in Permalink There have been mixed results for comic books turned into movies but Spiderman is one that definitely delivers. There is a lot to admire about this film. The cinematography from Don Burgess is stunning, credit also has to go to the editing and (despite my doubts) Tobey Maguire is brillliant as Peter Parker AND Spiderman. However, this movie was far from perfect. While Kirsten Dunst put in a solid performance as Mary Jane Watson she was nothing more than fodder for Spiderman's heroics. In this day and age it's a bit disheartening to see this `damsel in distress' tactic still at the forefront of mainstream Hollywood. Also the rescue sequence bore a strong resemblence to the payoff in `Batman Forever'. One area that I think will cause much debate between movie fans is the way the dialogue was used. Instead of going down the route of attempting sharp witticisms (something used to disastrous effect in `Batman and Robin' and `Blade 2') the dialogue was similiar to what you would read in one of the Spiderman comic books. While this will thrill `Spidey's' original fans it may become irritating to fans of movies who are looking for a solid screenplay. All in all, a good effort to the comic book/movie fraternity. While I look forward a lot more to `X-2', Spiderman was still a great deal better than Star Wars. P.S: At the end of the movie Spiderman is on a New York skyscraper with an oversized American flag in the background. I suspect that this was a scene added at the last minute because the scene involving the World Trade Centre was cut because of the September 11th attack. Fair enough, it was a terrible occurance but, as I am English, I can guarantee that it was a major turn-off for viewers not in America. But as the film has smashed box-office records, I don't think the distributors will care much anyway.
9.0~Go, Spidey, Go! sethdove Sign in Permalink Way to go, Sam Raimi! Who cares if the webs are coming from the nods in Spidey's arms rather than the web shooters? This is actually the best superhero movie ever made! (sorry Tim!) Acting is cool, script rolls fine (maybe too "whining" sometimes...), many laughs (not compelling, just good plain humour) and a couple of scenes that pay tribute to Evil Dead! What more can you ask? Nothing, really...
8.0~One of the most enjoyable films I've ever seen... sickink2 Sign in Permalink It's not going to win any Oscars, and, invariably, critics are going to bash it, but Spider-Man is an immensely satisfying flick. It simply could not have been done any better. There was plenty of what everyone came to see: smoothly stylized web-slinging and wall-crawling, made to look just as the comics depicted them; an over-the-top, believably psychotic villain in Willem Dafoe (who also had Green Goblin's posture down perfect, a nice touch and the kind of thing that makes having a huge fan direct the movie worthwhile); and a well-played love triangle that also captures of the feel of the comic perfectly. I've heard people gripe that there was no plot, but the movie followed the comic book almost to a tee; there was no reason to expect that it would be any different. If anything, David Koepp did a great job melding the Green Goblin storyline into the introduction to what will probably end up being a series of films. I've already been to see it three times, and I'm sure I'll go at least a few more. I give it a 10/10.
10.0~WOW grahamk-1 Sign in Permalink Hottest movie of the year. Tobey Maguire shows us exactly why he is rated as the hottest young actor on the circuit. This movie relies heavily on how subtle it can be delivered and in Maguire they have gotten one of the most subtle actors on the planet. Its one thing that he is great at and one thing that's often understated in moves laden with special effects. He carries the weight of the performance with such ease and at times makes it look like he is not even trying. After all he is playing to the most hypocritical and hard to please audience out there... The comic book guys. While the film doesn't port everything over from the comic the changes are acceptable and minimal. Webs coming from glands in the wrist and being bitten by a genetically modified spider rather than a radio active one. The latter doesn't make any difference as genetic modification was unknown when the concept of spider-man was being penned all those years ago and to be fair had it been known, he probably would have gone with the genetics anyway!!! Dafoe gives us a performance somewhat restricting him and with this he delivers by his standards what can only be called an adequate performance. The cameo of the day has got to go to J.K. Simmons who delivered a mast piece of a cameo in the shape of newspaper editor J J, Jameson. Any fan of the comic will tell you that the part was carried out to perfection. To sum up the film was brilliant and should secure Maguire's future as a major box office draw. He is great at subtlety, something that all the great actors have, Ed Harris, Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro etc... On a finishing note I thought it was brilliant and a little bit special that the original song be put in at the end of this film. Showed it really got to the grass roots. Watch it and you will enjoy it.
10.0~Excellent. DianaSmith999 Sign in Permalink Let me begin by saying that I have not read a single comic book in my lifetime. I have seen very few science-fiction movies, and the ones I have watched did not impress me. The last movie of this kind I saw was `X-Men', and that was only because my friends forced me to see it. I found that movie to be dreadful, and was determined never to see another `superhero movie' again. Obviously, I was highly reluctant to go see Spider-Man. When my friends finally dragged me to the theater to go see it, I was expecting yet another piece of poorly written childish fantasy. It turned out that this was exactly what Spider-Man was not. Somehow this movie managed to hold my attention, from the opening credits to the last scene with Mary Jane and Peter Parker. Few Hollywood movies I have watched in recent years have been able to do this. Spider-Man has an old-fashioned type of innocence and charm that is very much lacking in most of the movies being produced today. Tobey Maguire was brilliant as Peter Parker, and accomplished the nearly impossible task of making the premise of this movie - a teenager being bitten by genetically altered spider and ultimately becoming a superhero - seem plausible. I really cared about what happened to this character. The supporting cast was excellent, and I enjoyed almost every scene in the movie. The most surprising thing about Spider-Man was that it remained highly enjoyable even after many repeated viewings. I am not a person who enjoys watching the same movie over and over again, yet somehow I ended up seeing Spider-Man a record four times with various friends. I think their enthusiasm for this movie was infectious, because each time I watched it, the movie still felt exciting and compelling. I am actually considering purchasing this movie when it is released on video, something I have not done in a long time. Well done Sam Raimi (?). For better or for worse, you have turned this cynical skeptic into a Spider-Man fan, and I am looking forward to the sequel.
9.0~Great film adaptation of the very popular Marvel comics Spiderman john-long Sign in Permalink I loved this movie! The actors all seemed destined for their roles. Tobey Maguire had the perfect amount of nerdy boyish charm and conflicted hero-in-waiting. Kirsten Dunst WAS MJ! (Although some of the 'attitude' she had in the comic series was lacking in the movie; the rest was pure 'MJ'). Willem Dafoe I thought could have been saved for 'Doc Oct' but was not too surprised in the Green Goblin he pulled off. (I have loved his acting since first seeing him in Platoon). He (as always) showed great range from conflicted father to raging demon. He, as well as Maguire, Dunst and Robertson were all superb. The special effects were excellent and added to the story rather than upstaging it as seen in many sci-fi movies these days. I grew up on 'Spiderman' comics and felt that Sam Raimi and Stan 'The Man' Lee put together a great movie of a classic comic book. Well done all the way around.
10.0~Absolutely Amazing:A+ Kristakitty1 Sign in Permalink I have seen Spider-Man three times and I have been able to enjoy and still be shocked by the effects every single time! Tobey Maguire did both characters perfectly and I loved and laughed at the beginning scenes when he learns his new powers. Kirsten Dunst was wonderful at playing the girl-next-door MJ. Willem Dafoe was both frightening and enjoyable as Mr.Osborn/Green Goblin. The rest of the cast was well-picked also. This movie was well written and thought out and I thought it was very good how they were careful to put scenes in that clashed with 9/11. I also thought it was very nice how they sticked to the comic but changed things that wouldn't be appealing to audiences that weren't fans of the comics since I for one am one of those people. I loved it so much that my friends who have not seen it yet are getting tired of me talking about it! It was a funny, sad, happy, and an action-packed movie. I enjoyed every single second of it and was still on the edge of my seat by the end of the third time I had see the movie! A triumph for the director, the actors, and of course everyone else who helped make this wonderful and enjoyable movie!
10.0~My Childhood Dreams Brought to Life! griffolyon12 Sign in Permalink I was 12 years old when the first Spider-man film graced the silver screen. Up until that point I had never before experienced the level of hype in which this film received. This was the first film I ever obsessively tracked on the internet up until the very moment of the film's release. When I finally saw the film on opening day, I was blown away and ended up seeing the film again three more times in theaters. The main question now is, is the film just as good now as it was back in 2002? The answer is yes. Spider-man was always one of my favorite superheros growing up, and in that sense I am a little biased towards this film, but it actually is a terrific film. This is one of those few blockbuster films that I think was able to transcend its stereotypes and actually become simply put a good film. This film had all of the action and thrills in which you expect from big budget blockbusters, but it also had this genuine emotion and heart that made it resonate with me more so than many other similar films. As well, not only is this a very heartfelt film, but it is actually quite funny and the action is extremely exciting to watch, as well it gets quite dramatic near the end. Overall Spider-man is a good film with a terrific story, awesome acting, and genuine heart. I love this film so much and I hope others will too. I give Spider-man a perfect 10 out of 10!
8.0~Spidermans an action movie that will be watched no matter how bad it is dobbin-4 Sign in Permalink Spiderman is a good movie that deserves the speculation about it. From the title you would think I hate spider-man but after watching this series of Spiderman movies I am now a Spiderman lover because I've watched old ones bought Dvds, bought PS2 games, seen older Spiderman Dvds and lots more. Well I think everyone knows the story that Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider and becomes Spiderman and this movie did this and everything else well too. Another good thing about Spiderman is that it is not just gory they do not forget storyline which lots of movies seem to do nowadays. Overall I think movie deserves high praise because in my book it is the best Spiderman movie,PS2 game or sequel ever so 84%.
10.0~Very cool falls420 Sign in Permalink I went to Spiderman last night with my wife and some friends. As the opening credits were playing, I was sitting there muttering to myself "please don't suck... please don't suck..." I went into the movie with VERY high hopes, but also with a foreboding feeling that I was going to be highly disappointed as I was with Dungeons & Dragons, LOTR and some other movie I went to see but don't remember what it was because it wasn't worth it. Spiderman has ALWAYS been my #1 favorite superhero. I had Spidey underoos as a kid, whatched the cartoon religiously, and collected all sorts of spidey stuff when I was old enough to afford it. I've read a lot of comments on the movie here, and both sides bring out good points, but a lot of people just missed the whole point to the movie. Sam Raimi is one of my favorite directors. He does a really outstanding job on movies without having the budget that names like Ron Howard, Stephen Spielburg and George Lucas commands. I saw an interview with Sam on TV last week and he was scared that true Spidey fans would despise him forever on doing a hack job, but was confident that the movie would work out well. Which it did. Tobey who? Never heard of him. The first thing I ever saw him on was the Letterman show where he sat there and kept getting irritated at Dave for making fun of him and the movie. Unfortunately, I had that distaste of him when I did go in, but I think he pulled it off quite well. The only other person I could think of (and this was YEARS ago) who may have had a better run as Spiderman would have been the late Brandon Lee... but he was almost too much of a "pretty boy" to effectively play a nerdy type. Willem Dafoe is a great actor who was handed a cheesy role. I just don't mean for the movie, but in general. Jack Nicholson had to pull off the Joker, which he did.. Willem pulled off the GG. I wasn't too wild about the "biosuit" and agree with another viewer comment that it made him look like a Power Rangers bad guy, but what the heck. Kirsten was "ok" as MJ. I love that she called him "Tiger"... but just that once. That was perfect. The upside down kiss was perfect. The gratuitous wet t-shirt shot was impressive. I think she had more chemistry with Aunt May than Peter and uncle Ben, but unfortunately, Cliff and Tobey didn't have enough time to really do too much. The special effects worried me... I loved the web-slinging shots.. for the most part they were impressive and really fed my acrophobia. A few times some of the CG was... painful. All in all... outstanding job. The changes from movie to comic were minimal and allowed smooth transitions. Back when spidey came out, radioactive everything was the huge news. Nowadays, it's genetics. Next movie, let's get some more wisecracks in there, and I would positively die if we get to see Venom and Carnage at some point... that was one of the most trying times in the life of Peter Parker, and contrary to what some of the people here think, Spiderman isn't about actionadventureshootemupandbeatupallthebadguys. Spiderman has a much more human element to it. I hope Sam Raimi and the cast keep up the great work. The sequel is going to have to be twice as good as the first, otherwise people will be even more critical than they are now. Clean up the CG, a little bit more character development and interaction and let's let Spidey do a few more wisecracks. Good luck trying to make a Doc Oc or Rhino (especially one that doesn't look like a high school mascot). And stay away from the Spidey/X-Men union stuff. Yuck.
8.0~Spider-man fantastic movie stevene20 Sign in Permalink Spider-man is the best marvel comic superhero and it was time to give the character a decent film, and there can be no complaints. Sam Raimi has made the film about how Peter Parker handles the powers and not about how he uses his powers, which benefits as the other superhero films show how the character uses the powers. The film shows how Peter Parker becomes Spider-man and how he handles the powers "with great power comes great responsibility." After an accident on a school trip Peter Parker is bitten by a genetically altered super-spider this making him Spider-man. His identity must remain a secret otherwise if Spider-man's enemies find out who his loved ones are and if they got hurt, then Peter would never be able to forgive himself. But when an enemy threatens New York, called "The Green Goblin," Spider-man must stop him. A thrilling spectacle.
3.0~Extremely Cheesy Graphics; Almost Insulting. tommande63 Sign in Permalink Everyone wants this movie to be great. As a Stan Lee fan I was hoping so as well. I was disappointed. Be warned the graphics suck, they are cheesy and look computer generated. I thought the point was to try to make them blend in with the picture. I'm a big Sam Raimi fan and this will be a blockbuster from all the HYPE but the Green Goblin, to put it bluntly, looked stupid. DaFoe would have looked better with green makeup on. All this hype and this is what we get. Oh well There's always The Hulk and Daredevil coming. I hope in the Spiderman sequel they do something creative with Doc Octopus. Your better off renting Army of Darkness if you want to see a good Raimi movie.
8.0~Enjoyable film even for an adult vahab Sign in Permalink I found the film very enjoyable for an adult audience, even though I went to an early show with a lot of kids in the theater. When the French director Trauffaut was criticized for praising Hitchcoks's Rear Window and told the reason he liked the film so much is that he had not lived in New York City and Greenwich Village. He replied that the film is not about the village but about the cinema. If I may rephrase this great quote and say that Spiderman is not about a comic character but about loneliness and not being understood. Having said, for parents who think this is a great action movie for kids, I must find the ending is rather grim. Do not expect too much excitement from your son or daughter. In fact, if they think the film is not much fun, it may mean they are very intelligent. I should add, I am not the only adult that thinks this way.
7.0~A worthwhile watch, with one cautionary note... jarret-h Sign in Permalink Well done movie, effectively transitioned from one to the next of the various stages in the burgeoning crime fighting career of the wall-crawler. One note of importance, and this may be a *spoiler*: Mary Jane has amorous desires/relations with 4 DIFFERENT men in the span of the movie. (3 months max- movie time); -Flash Thompson -Harry Osborn -Spiderman -Peter Parker Yeesh! I find this a little disconcerting, and a very poor example to have for leading ladies alike...
10.0~AWESOME!!!!!!! Nano5656 Sign in Permalink I was in the 12:15 PM movie Friday, May 3rd, 2002, the first showing at the Reading Cinema. There were less that 20 people at this showing, but the cheers sounded like a multitude. We had fun, we laughed, and we were WOWed. We were driven to the edges of our seats and brought back again & again. To find a senior, as myself, as the villain was refreshing... Not every movie has to have prepubescent characters throughout and Spider-Man is proof of pregeriatric villainous excellence. I loved the boyish innocence of the lead character juxtapose to the nothing-you-can-do-is-good-enough demeanor of the power welding father figure. We can all identify with one or more of the well-developed characters in this movie. It was a truly well spent 2½b hours of suspended reality. I can hardly wait for the sequel?. Please bring back the same actors?
9.0~Great Spidey Action bigeddie69 Sign in Permalink Best so far of all the blockbusters in 2002, loved every second of it. Top casting, top story and brilliant adaptation of the original idea. They could SPIN this formula out for some years to come. Please don't change a thing.
9.0~Action? andre_albrecht Sign in Permalink I really liked this movie. Actually it was the best movie I've seen this year after Episode II. The only thing that could have been better is the action. The movie has some pretty good action scenes but at the end ***LITTLE SPOILER*** before the fist fight between Spidey and the Green Goblin a big action scenes would have been perfect. Nevertheless 8.5 out of 10.
1.0~Good but could have been better! kenandraf Sign in Permalink Good action sci-fi PG-13 movie that uses CGI effects very well to depict the famous superhero.Above average cinematography and directing.The screenplay was average and the script was below average.The movie banked too heavily on the heroes great costume and the outstanding special effects although for some reason,slacked off on the quality acting and depth.Due to this slacking off factor,comic book fans who expect a quality level as high as SUPERMAN (1979) will be let down.Do watch this one with an average movie expectation and it will deliver!Only for big action sci-fi fans and big fans of Web head. My major complaints are:1)actress who portrayed Mary Jane does not look like Mary Jane or even has the persona of the Mary Jane I know in the comic books 2)High School scenes are very un High School looking and comes off as cheap as a porno movie 3)the love story was very weak and intellectually insulting to the more smarter audience 4)Parker in the comic books was a very good scientist who acted nerdy but was a much better looking guy than the movie version Parker 5)Spidey has WEB SHOOTERS and does not create his own natural webbing 6)Uncle Ben actor was not good 7)the scene where Parker is bitten by Spider is weak 8)the movie music is weak 9)Green Goblin in movie is not Green Goblin I know 10)where is Gwen Stacy! 11)Bugle Building is not shaped like that! 12)Spidey is much funnier than was shown here 13)Goblin's/Defoe's lines were too shalow 14)non focus on Parker's scientific genius side makes his creation of Spidey's incredible costume weak The movie got the very technical hard parts very well (Spidey costume,Spidey special effect movements,Spidey webbing,Goblin lanterns and hover craft,action sequences) but for some weird reason,was just plain careless with stuff that are sooooooo easy to deal with.The result is instead of a MASTERPIECE that could have been on par with SUPERMAN (1979) or STAR WARS (1977),we end up with a good summer popcorn movie that will collect dust as soon as the next good popcorn movie hype comes along.A masterpiece saga like SPIDER MAN deserves much more than that,even more so now that the CGI effects are here to do it right......
8.0~Raimi Sets the Standard for Future Superhero Movies brando647 Sign in Permalink In 2002, the world was treated to the second big budget treatment of a Marvel comic book in the form of Spider-Man. Bryan Singer had opened the doors for major comic book adaptations two years prior with his adaptation of the X-Men, and he proved such movies could make major earnings in the box office. Well, along came a spider and proved just how true that was when Spider-Man grossed $403.7 million in the United States alone. The film introduces audiences to the origins of the hero, when Peter Parker is bitten by a genetically-altered spider and is given extraordinary abilities (i.e. web-slinging, wall-crawling, his "spider-sense"). After the death of his uncle at the hands of a car-jacker, Peter becomes determined to prevent crime and evil forces from ruining the lives of others and his first real test arrives in the form of the Green Goblin. My favorite aspect of Sam Raimi's film is that it FELT like a true Spider-Man movie. While I did enjoy Singer's X-Men, it didn't have the same feel as the comics/cartoons. It was the X-Men, but it was Bryan Singer's X-Men. Watching Raimi's film, it feels as if it's ripped straight from the pages of the comics. It faithfully depicted all of it's characters with a couple exceptions; some liberties had to be taken to fit 40 years of comic book history into a 2 hour movie. Just as in the comics, Peter is troubled by having to juggle his life as a super-hero with his life as a normal person, and one of the lessons our hero learns over the course of the film is that he can't have both. Raimi also gives us some great character development on the part of the villain, Norman Osborn/the Green Goblin. He takes the time to build up the father/son relationship between Norman and his son, Peter's best friend Harry, which builds up for further stories in the future. In addition to having a fantastic filmmaker at the helm, the movie benefits from near perfect casting. Tobey Maguire is more than capable of pulling off the meek, nerdy Peter Parker as well as his web/one-liner slinging alter ego. Kirsten Dunst, while not overwhelming in her performance, was a great Mary Jane Watson and James Franco was a solid Harry Osborn. As I said, the casting was pretty much perfect across the board, right down to Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson as Peter's aunt and uncle. The best (and I know of many who agree with me) was Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn. Seriously, I can't think of another actor who pull off such eccentric, insane roles like this man. He WAS the Green Goblin and I couldn't see any other actor having stepped into that role. The movie contains plenty of action with seamless CGI inter-mixed into real-time stunts, and the story also contains a strong plot with more than enough heart to make this more than just an action flick. Aside from a few slow moments, there really isn't much to complain about with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man and I think he was the first to set the standards for what the comic fans should expect from big screen adaptations of their favorite heroes.
1.0~Spidey's Back usual_please Sign in Permalink for the love of god take me up to the top pasture and shoot me now. shoot me multiple times in the face. don't ever stop. i would rather you do this than watch this wretched piece of film again. please help. why did i waste 2 hours of my life on this. i am slowly dying. in my dying hour this is what i chose to watch? tell me why!? it. was. Satan. seriously. nothing. happened. and he was like "omg, omfg i got bitten by a spider it gave me aids now I'm cool!" did anyone notice that the fact that he was a man-spider was a metaphor for AIDS? note the innuendo. he wanted so badly for Mary Jane to have aids. just like him. run Mary Jane. run whilst you still have arms. the homo-erotic relationship between spidey and the green goblin lacked the sensuality and sexually driven tension it needed for me to truly believe that the love between a man-spider and a mouldy goblin could ever exist in this fickle world of Paris Hilton's and Kimberly Stuarts. they were in love! why didn't you just let them be? Mary Jane you tramp! you stole away the homo-erotic love. the beautiful homo-erotic love they shared. how does that make you feel, wench. i did however enjoy the connotations of the web spraying. he sprayed the "web" all over town, not only on men and women but on children and the elderly. none survived. i often dream about spidey and his masculine web. mmhmmm. i like that. however this movie was nothing. it is dead to me. and i would have preferred to see a blank screen. so, much unlike a dog returning to its own sick, i will not return to this film. or sick.
8.0~Does whatever a spider can! Klaatu-18 Sign in Permalink I was anxiously waiting for this movie. The "buzz" seemed to be awesome, but apparently they didn't allow screenings very far in advance. (Ebert and Roeper won't do their TV reviews until opening weekend) This usually does not bode well. Very likely, it was to be full of gosh-wow FX but nothing much in the way of a script. I was not disappointed. All the characters were just right and the actors wonderfully chosen. Some liberties were taken with the original stories to make it into a movie. Mary Jane Watson becomes the girl next door that Peter Parker has had a thing for since he was six. (In the comic, he doesn't meet MJ until after he's been Spidey awhile and had a short-lived relationship with J Jonah Jameson's secretary Betty Brant). The bit with having the webbing come out of him instead of being a brilliant off the top of his head invention was neat. It sped up the plot and set up some amusing scenes as he tried to learn how to use this ability. Danny Elfman's music is, as always, a great counterpoint to the super-heroics. As far as younger kids are concerned, there's no sex or bad language, but lots of action {read: violence) and the Green Goblin may be a bit scary. Cool stuff. Eight stars.
8.0~A Fine Adaption On A Comic Book(SPOILERS) I_Am_The_Taylrus Sign in Permalink SPOILERS Let me just straighten this out, I was a huge fan of any sort of comic book, but not really a comic book movie for that matter. When I heard this was coming out I was not really planning on seeing it. When I heard who was directing it, though, I got some tickets. I mean, it was Sam Raimi! I am a huge fan of the Evil Dead series and I did not think Sam Raimi would direct something like this. Evil Dead was a gory horror film. I saw Spider-man. I am glad I did. This is easily the best adaption from a comic book ever. Here is the plot. I am sure everyone knows the plot of the comic book, but here is the movie plot. A man named Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider. Instead of killing him it gives him the powers of a spider. Then his uncle is murdered. Peter decides to become a superhero. He calls himself Spider-man and he fights crime all over New York City. Unfortuanatelty there is a new villain in the city. It is Peter's friend's dad. He becomes evil after an experiment. After some fights with him Spider-man kills him by jumping out of the way of his glider with spikes. It stabs the Green Goblin, which is what he calls himself, instead and he dies. After that, Harry, which is the name of his friend, think that Spider-man killed him and he develops a grudge against Spider-man. Overall, this is a very well-done superhero movie. In fact, it is probably the bets superhero movie. It is also very fun to watch anytime, anywhere. Also, I think the actors did a wonderful job portraying the characters in the comic books, or at least I think they did. Anway, this is a very entertaining joy-ride for anyone, but I think the hard-core fans of Spider-man will enjoy it more than me. I still enjoy it, though. 8/10 Recommended Films: Spider-man 2.
8.0~Possibly the best adaption of a comic book ever... xlars Sign in Permalink This movie is great. I have to admit, that I was very skeptic when walking into the theater to watch it, but I was pleasantly surprised. This is really worth watching. Hopefully the sequel will be equal.
1.0~DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SKIP THIS ONE odor007 Sign in Permalink The weekend was coming up, I had nothing better to do, so I fell into the trap of high-budget box office entertainment, and paid the $9.50 to see "Spiderman." After the first 45 minutes of the film, I was thinking to myself that I couldn't have spent the money any better--I was laughing at Tobey Maguire's reactions to his newfound spider-like abilities, I was getting drawn into the plot and looking forward to some action, and I even found myself rooting for Tobey Maguire who is perfectly cast as the classic and predictable high-school nerd. But things soon took a terrible turn. The acting became terrible, the plot became completely predictable, and the special effects became so unrealistic and visually flawed that I found them at the point of distraction. As a New Yorker, I found the city-assaults on New York by the "Green Goblin" not entertaining, but more of a recreation of Sept. 11th. But then, later on in the film, I found myself annoyed at how the makers of this film, obviously influenced by September 11th, put in all these scenes with the people of New York united against evil, and Spiderman flying by all these American flags. Is it too much to ask not to have scenes of bombs killing people, buildings being blown to bits, people running everywhere, and screams? But then is it too much to ask not to have corny things thrown into every scene just to prove to the movie-going public that the makers of the film care more about morals than profit? With this film I found myself smack in the middle of two extremes. Class, simplicity, style...these elements were not used by the makers of this film. Gaudy special effects, large explosions, and artificial and shallow love scenes were the things that made up this film. Spidey is a young nerd one minute; a raging maniac determined for revenge the next. Kirsten Dunst likes him one minute, and then she blows him off for a while. The love scenes that were the only human-touches this film had were meant to be as simple, dull, and straightforward as possible, but in the end were only confusing! I didn't even know whether I should take the time to review this film, but I hope I've helped someone. My advice...see "Panic Room" instead. It's also a big, box office smash, but is immeasurably better. Save your time and money on this one--unless you're a parent of smaller kids or under the age of 16.
6.0~too much anticipation nivek_nailgun Sign in Permalink The times I end up enjoying movies most are when they suddenly promote it and the following week it's released. This way,there isn't all the hype and hence anticipation. Let me say that first,I'm a huge comics fan (including Spidey) and I don't at all have a problem with the changes in the basic story arc. Mind you,I prefer Peter inventing his own webshooters but that's a small complaint. The movie simply didn't capture Spiderman. It was too much flash and not enough substance. Yea,it told a story that wasn't paper thin but it didn't communicate it very well. I'm not altogether sure that I'm happy with the takeover of computer animation. I enjoy it to enhance but certainly not to dominate,which is what it did in Spiderman. Oh well,I'm sure there'll be a sequel. I personally would like to see them do Venom. 6/10
7.0~Who's the Director? sampleman411-1 Sign in Permalink Yes, director Raimi made his mark in the movie business with his "Evil Dead" film (before doing this Spidey movie). He initially doubted the validity of Dunst's acting abilities. Ms. Kirsten was already making mince-meat out of actors such as Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise... and she was only eleven-years-old at the time that 'Vampire' movie was first released a decade ago. One might ask Raimi himself "Who are you?" and then say "Kirsten Dunst" is already legend. Now about the movie "Spider-man"... I thoroughly enjoyed this actioner/romancer. There is plenty for boys, girls and adults. Of course, the violence sometimes reaches intense proportions and levels, but then what are we paying for movies nowadays? Do we want to spend $9.50 for a trip to our backyards? The answer is a resounding "NO!" The actors playing Spidey/Peter Parker, Mary Jane, and all the rest, do their best at what they do best. Even Wilem Dafoe as the green villain is totally right on up there with other cinematic baddies, and deserves the respect and proper credit very few, stuck-up critics are willing to give. Fantastic special-effects, but we all know that film-makers nowadays have got to focus more on story, and less on cyber-magic (Let's face it, sometimes these fx artists get a bit carried away!). Watch this one with people who don't like talking to you while you're trying to pay attention to the movie.

3.0~Utter Tosh tonyhic Sign in Permalink Action scene, heartwarming dialogue, action scene, heartwarming dialogue,... Repeat this sequence until the end, finishing with a shot of the American flag, and millions will hail it as a great movie. As far as superhero movies go, this is worse than ALL the Batmans and ALL the Supermans. I can't imagine the plot being any more simplistic. Worst of all, it takes itself seriously. A painful experience.
1.0~Over-Rated milkslug Sign in Permalink This film is over-rated. An okay telling of the origin that they managed not to screw up too much, followed by a terrible action plot with a very bad Green Goblin wearing a bad metal mask. The CGI is very jerky, and where are Spider-Man's funny one-liners? Basically this is one of the worst, choppy, badly-plotted big hits in recent memory, way behind the original Superman, and even behind Batman, in translating a superhero to the screen. Let's hope they can do better with number two...
10.0~This will become your favorite film gamester9 Sign in Permalink I have been waiting to see this movie for a long time because I loved the Evil Dead trilogy and the way Sam directs. I will admit that I'm not the biggest spider-man fan in the world. I don't go buying the comic book every month like some and I don't go to conventions all over the world. I was amazed by this film and it easily came to become my all-time favorite. The best thing about the film is that IS DOES NOT follow the comic book. Let's face it, if it did follow the comic book, chances are I wouldn't have seen it 5 times. People who are upset because the film didn't follow the comic books need to get a life. I love Resident Evil, but if the movie followed the game exactly, why would I bother to go see the film, I would just play the game again and not waste the time or the money. Personally if you want a good oppinion, talk to someone who isn't into the spiderman (oh did I forget the hyphen) comic book and went to see the film. You will get an honest answer from them.
10.0~By far the best Super Hero Movie I've seen !!!!! dolly__rocker Sign in Permalink Story-wise, casting, effects, music, and adaptaion ---- this is the best action hero movie I've seen in 20 yrs !!!! Not to put down the others, but judging from the audience, it seems like everyone has needed a movie like this for a long time. Look out George Lucas !!! Sam Raimi is finally going to be noticed !
9.0~My favorite superhero action film of all time ivo-cobra8 Sign in Permalink Spider-Man (2002) it is an epic Sam Raimi Action superhero flick! This first Spider-Man film become my favorite film of superheroes. I remember when this film come out in 2002 and become a huge hit that year. I kept watching and listening video spot Hero - by Chad Kroeger featuring Josey Scott. I wanted to see so badly that film that I bag my neighbor to get me that film and he did I watch it on Computer the same year that this film come out. And I love this film I love it not as much as I love Spider-Man 2 (2004) and The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) but I still love it. I am glad they made this film in 2002 and Sam Raimi directed this film. I love it and it is my favorite best Spider-Man movie yet. I watch it in 2003 my mom bought me VHS when she was still alive, she isn't anymore it remind on my teenage years in high school. I watch it yesterday and I still can't get bored with it. Green Goblin was the best villain ever in Spider-Man I love him. The Amazing Spider-Man was really awesome I love it so much. I love them all Spider-Man movies. I still find the original enjoyable, but I'm not nearly as forgiving of its flaws as some are. I think Spider-Man 2 was great, but the first one really is... crappy. I get it that it appeals to people by "capturing that exciting comic book feeling", but that isn't enough for me to say it's a good movie. The new movie has stronger emotion and had more weight to it, and I was RELIEVED that the ending was different. Yeah, it was a selfish thing on the new Peter's part, but I forgive him for it. A marvel movie shouldn't really go to much into the origin unless it relates to the story of the rest of the movie, if the origin is connected to the actual plot, then it's appropriate to show it, if not, then it's something you can get done and over with in the first 10 minutes or so, this movie is a prime example, the goblin wasn't related to the origin, so it went by quickly. I love The Amazing Spider-Man a lot, but my favorite movie will always be Spider-Man 2002 I grow up with that movie. Spider-Man 2002 is much much better for me then The Amazing Spider-Man is. Fans who compare TASM over SM are just kids and maybe they watch TASM before they even hear about SM or who knows why they do that, everyone has their own opinion. I love Spider-Man 2002 equal the way I love The Amazing Spider-Man:P That is my opinion . Average teenager Peter Parker is transformed into an extraordinary super hero after he is accidentally bitten by a radioactive spider. When his beloved uncle is savagely murdered during a robbery, young Peter vows to use his powers to avenge his death. Deeming himself "Spider-Man," he sets about ridding the streets of crime, bringing him into conflict with malevolent super-villain "Green Goblin." The action, acting and pacing are excellent and the movie manages to action, romance, drama and comedy all into one great package! Spidey has always been one of my favorites. I was surprised that Raimi was given the role of director with this film, considering his only real claim to fame is the Evil Dead series before this, but his direction here is very well done. The acting is very good. Tobey Maguire IS Spider-Man/Peter Parker. Everyone fits into their role well -- great cast. The special-effects are okay. Raimi can't seem to decide what scene should be CGI or which should be wires when it comes to the antics of Spidey saving the day or duking it out with a villain "Green Goblin".The musical score was only part of the success for this movie thanks to Danny Elfman. The special effects were mind blowing for me to see Spiderman swing from high buildings to catch the bad guys. This movie is worth every penny and it is worth owning. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson did a wonderful performance of her role. I seriously love the actress, I am a huge fan of her and I always was. She did played the character well, like the role of Mary Jane Watson was written on her skin. "With great power comes great responsibility." Bottom of line I love this film and the fighting scenes between Spidey and The Green Goblin was awesome. CGI in this film wasn't bad It was great. The whole film was huge Entertainment. Spider-Man is a 2002 American superhero film directed by Sam Raimi.

2.0~Weak Adaptation to the Big Screen iamito Sign in Permalink Sam Raimi is a great entertainment director but he is not very good at adapting comic books. You can look at it from this angle: Tim Burton and Batman - that's a great adaptation to the big screen from a comic book! It had the essence of the heroe, the smart dialogues, the gothic environment, the proper casting... Spider-man is on a completely different scenario. It is a "typical holywood money making" film with weak plot, uninteresting scenarios... The problem starts with the main actor: Tobey Maguire - he's the ideal image of the well mannered boy with an inocent smile. He doesn't portray properly the "Marvel" Peter Parker! What we see in "Spider Man" (2002) is a Hollywood Peter Parker, developed in order to look as much "audience friendly" as possible. The movie has very weak dialogues - some are so irrealistic that they become pathetic -, there's an unbalanced use of special effects... This is a movie to sell, not to tell the story of the real Spider Man. It even distorts some facts about Peter Parker's powers and how he got them! This is a movie to see with lots of pop corns.
8.0~The first superhero movie I actually liked Spike-Washington Sign in Permalink When this came out that particular summer, I thought to myself, "Big deal. It's just another superhero movie." Most of the superhero movies, including the Batman films by Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher, weren't doing it for me and I don't know if I even had a favorite superhero film back then. After Spider-Man ended its run in theaters and came out that fall on video, I watched it and was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't bad at all. Another superhero origin film with all the right elements. A high school youngster, a loving older couple, newly-discovered abilities, and a reason to help the less fortunate. Still, I've heard some say that Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin was a little lame and that he looked like something out of the Power Rangers, but it worked as a realistic villain. At least the suit wasn't too CGI; just a man-in-suit creation. I'd never even heard of Spider-Man's origin story before this movie but later read about it and discovered some minor differences. Those didn't bother me in the slightest though not everyone would and will agree with me. But whatever. Even if you're not the biggest fan of superheroes, try this one for starters. It got me on the path to Marvel, as did Iron Man and the Avengers. And hopefully I'll get to watch the later Spider-Man films (Amazing Spider-Man 1 and 2 don't count). But just give this a chance. Please?
6.0~Well cast-- Kirsten Dunst and Toby McGuire are very good. "Batmanish" overkill present, but kept to a minimum bopdog Sign in Permalink How could anyone resist the charms of sweet little Kirsten Dunst? Although she's now 6-foot eight, and is 47 years old. No wait--- she's still young, and a delightful actor. Her dramatic work in "Crazy/Beautiful," as well as her extensive and marvelous comedy work prior to that ("Drop Dead Gorgeous," and "Dick" are two under-appreciated modern classics)have proven her to be a major talent. She is definitely the Real Deal--- not just some poof-in-the-pan passing fad. In "Spiderman" she does the obligatory "Oooing" and "aaahing" at the hero--- but funnily, she also brings a realness to her role that goes beyond what previous comic-book-movie actresses have done. She brings an innocence and an excitement to her on-screen behaviors that is disarming and engaging for the audience. Yaay Kirsten! Toby McGuire is well matched for the role--- "Spiderman" comic have always been a bit on the underdog side. The movie is no exception. But I was very happy to see that this movie avoided (mostly) the bizarre and depressing "dark side" vibe that somehow seduced the makers of the tedious and self-absorbed "Batman," the pretty good "Mask," and even the horrid "Monkey Bone" (from an otherwise brilliant Brendan Fraser. What happened with THAT, dood?). Spidie's world seemed virtually normal, and the sci-fi overkill was only hinted at with Willem DeFoe's space-scooter thingy that could evidently run around the sky forever on a single, invisible, tank of gas. Over all, much more good hearted than previous movie-cartoons of comic books. WAY brighter, way better all around. Still not a masterpiece--- but entertaining enough.
10.0~Amazing Spider Film! nohoohboy Sign in Permalink I went expecting a great movie with an accurate depiction from the comic book. I can honestly say it remained very true to the comic. Although the romance scenes are a bit cheesy, Tobey Maguire played an excellent Spiderman and even a better Peter Parker. Willem Dafoe plays Green Goblin to perfection, everything that a maniacal twisted evil villain should be. This is a great film and I'm hoping for many more Spiderfilms to come!
9.0~The Legend of the Web-Swinger thinker1691 Sign in Permalink Having grown up in the 60's, I, like so many millions of young teens were introduced to Spiderman through the medium of Marvel comics. Now through the magic of Hollywood Cinima, American audiences are further introduced to "Spiderman" the movie. The imaginative comic writer, Stan Lee is credited with bringing his web-swing character to life and does a 'marvelous' job of transferring the lonely, troubled teen to the big screen. His original concept is that of a young, book-worm, nerdy teenager who is accidentally bitten by a radioactive spider. Nearly dying, Peter Parker, (admirably played by Tobey Maguire) awakens the following day and discovers that instead of killing him, he has been transformed into a super hero with astonishing powers. Everything from his spider senses to his incredible spider strength, Parker is at first convinced he can make some easy money, by exhibiting his abilities in an arena. Unfortunely, his perception of why he was chosen is changed when his seeming ambivalence turns to tragedy with the death of his favorite uncle. The film is imaginative and laced with action scenes which enhance the comic-book-hero's' exploits. With the additional talents of Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, Cliff Robertson as Ben Parker and J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, the film proves it is slated to become a classic. ****
10.0~Spidey's Feature Film debut is AMAAAAAAAZING!!! RomeyRome Sign in Permalink I LOVE SPIDER-MAN. You can't ask for anything more from a super-hero action flick. This movie's got it all! The acting is excellent, the action is HOT, and the Goblin is deliciously evil! The cinematography, the directing, and the script are superb. Peter Parker is a hero's hero. I LOVE SPIDER-MAN. Just a couple of gripes but nothing too serious. I thought that the CG could have been better, but hey, these animators are barely scratching the surface with this new technology. Give it a few more years and we'll be in for quite a treat. I LOVE SPIDER-MAN. One more gripe, what the hell was up with Kirsten Dunst's hair? That red was very wrong for her. Anyways, that's it. All the other super-heroes out there, Superman, Daredevil, Wolverine, etc. probably have Spider-man posters hanging on their walls. They look up to your friendly neighborhood Spider-man. That's right, Spider-man is #1 BABY!!! Oh and did I mention? I LOVE SPIDER-MAN!!!!
6.0~Remember, it was a comic book first. swondpooping Sign in Permalink Once I remembered it was developed from a comic book, I was able to forgive the campy performance by Kirsten Dunst as the love interest. Once forgiven, the movie was enjoyable and a very nice flash back to my childhood and watching Spidey on television. Unfortunately, the computer graphics used to enhance the web swinging sequences failed to take into account basic rules of physics and the fact that humans (even with spider powers) just don't bend that way. A good film that will probably find its way into my personal library.
9.0~AN Amazing Movie! TJFBryant Sign in Permalink Although Maguire may have seemed like a horrible choice for a superhero, especially before any has actually seen the movie, Boy could we have been more wrong. Toby Maguire emerges in the character of Peter Parker/ Spiderman. Before watching the movie, I would have chosen Maguire as the last person to play this part. Indeed, he extend beyond all of my expectations when I say this is certainly a break out role for the young actor. Not only will Maguire be immortalized as a comic book hero (e.g Harrison Ford/ Indiana Jones), He will grow as an accomplished and up and coming persona in Hollywood. The movie, couldn't have been any better than it was without Toby. Toby made the character believable, even if Spiderman only is a comic book superhero. Final Result. Spiderman is the Most Amazing Superhero film to be made so far (previously it was Batman 1989). I give it a subtle *** 1/2 - **** stars. Good job to Sam Raimi and all the cast for making most of the spidey fans impatiently wait in anticipation for the next one.
7.0~The sequel is already in the works. TuckMN Sign in Permalink Peter Parker is supposed to be -- at least pre-spider bite -- a nerdy wallflower with little personality. That being the case Tobey McGuire was casting genius. I wanted very much to like the big-screen adaptation of the Marvel Comics hero `Spider-Man.' I'm not sure why but I was disappointed. The score by Danny Elfman was good -- but only in places. The script was entertaining -- but not consistently so. The photography was sometimes great -- but again, only at times. I believe that is why `Spider-Man' didn't win me over: It was inconsistent. The action scenes -- particularly when Spidey was flying through the air with the help of his self-generated webs -- moved too fast, taking away some of the Gee-Whiz factor. James Franco -- the son of the Green Goblin/Norman Osborn, played by Willem Dafoe -- though up to the part was probably cast because of his cheekbones, making him actually look like he could be Mr. Dafoe's progeny. Kirsten Dunst was the best thing in the movie. Not to put too fine a point on things but especially for the scene in the rain and that sweater. There was lots of violence with a message that violence, in and of itself, can solve problems; not something I would want to teach a child. The movie seemed longer than its official run time of 121 minutes -- not a good sign. Not everything about this movie was bad. Watching Peter Parker discover his new body and how he fumbled with learning to use his new powers was entertaining and the nice update of a genetically enhanced spider (from a radioactive spider in the comic book) was a good touch. The animation sequences were wonderful with the touch of the genius that is Stan Lee. If you are going to see this movie you should probably see it on the big screen -- or in the very least on a widescreen DVD -- the action is not going to fit on a small television set.
3.0~Millions of people are seriously deluded Evil Bob Sign in Permalink I am trying not to be overly negative and I would just like to point out that i am not a Spidey buff who feel hard done-by. This was one film that, along with Attack of the Clones, i had waited with baited breath to see but I found myself laughing all the way through it and not because the jokes were funny but because everything was wrong with it. Tobey Maguire has seriously impressed me in other films (Cider house rules, Wonderboys) and I've always been a fan of Kirsten Dunst but both of them disappointed me. The biggest fault I believe is Sam Raimi. As much as I love the Evil Deads he just was not suited to direct a big-budget action feature like that. Every now and then I expected to see Bruce Campbell jumping up and exclaiming "Groovy". In fact he should have played the Green Goblin because, as improbable as it seems, not even he could manage to be as Hammy as Willem Defoe was. The script was cheesey, the love scenes were laughable in how slushy they were and the computer graphics were probably done over a weekend in ILM because they just look rushed. The plot moves along sith break-neck speed which normaly I would not complain about but the speed with which it delivers his detail is so that you fail to empathise or create a connection with any of the characters *SPOILER WARNING* and because of this when Peters uncle dies I found myself saying "Who cares?". I could go on but I won't. I'll end by asking "Did anyone else see a big Raging Bull rip-off in the end fight?" I think Scorsese should sue somebody.
3.0~A Great Idea Predictably Made Mediocre joshuwon Sign in Permalink In the last few years we have seen a number of fictional "institutions" destroyed by Hollywood (or its agents) for commercial gain. We start with originals like Star Wars, continue with re-makes like Oceans 11 and end the 'sell-out' season with "Spider-Man". This movie is for people who don't want to think or to encounter challenging characters/situations while sitting eating there popped corn. Everything about this movie is bland and homogenized to the point of lacing any impact what-so-ever. Things happen, things even occur, but your investment in the people (characters) involved is minimal : everyone is a complete cliche - Parker : the loser nerd (who is too dumb to invent his own web-slingers - like he does in the comic), Mary Jane, the misunderstood tramp next door, Flash, the bully and Harry, the rich kid who doesn't want to be rich. All these characters are just flat, cardboard cut-outs that are propped up to facilitate us all getting to the next movie. Weak. When your movie is nothing but a set-up for the sequel with a bunch of characters no one cares about...what then? Well then --- EFFECTS. Yes, Spiderman swoops and crawls believably and leaps less-believably and --- WHO CARES? Spiderman should never be an effects movie. It can't hold it's own against Star Wars, LOTR or even The Matrix. It only has ONE TRICK --- this guy is like a spider --- WHOO-hOooooo.... But people will like it for the effects - either because they can not articulate their dissatisfaction or because (as many of us) they are afraid to disagree with popular or peer opinion. People will fear to say anything against a movie that has such obvious appeal to --- WHO? Why can't Hollywood make a super-hero movie that is real and that has real people and that is somewhat challenging? Why can't they focus a little more on the psychological and not the effects? I guess they did and its called "Unbreakable". And speaking of effects --- they are pretty much lame. You view these effects as an outsider - watching another play a video game instead of yourself. The fight scenes are shot in an elevator. The flight scenes are shot in a hanger. It all seems fake and plastic. They did not make it real. So - to sum up - weak. lame, trash. Not even on the level of X-Men.
5.0~Have seen it before (slight spoiler) nilshenry Sign in Permalink This could have been a perfect cartoon action movie, if it weren't for the morals in it, like the bit about taking responsibility for your actions, and the low background music playing while Spider-Man's aunt is praying right before she is attacked. SLIGHT SPOILER! You are several times reminded of what country the movie comes from. During the last minute of the movie we get to se the American flag waving in the wind in slow motion with Spider-Man swinging himself around it. END OF SPOILER We all know that USA is a great country, without Americans pushing their nationalism onto us outsiders. The British have made pretty OK movies, without showing their flag in the closing scenes. The Swedes manage to do it as well. The film is apart from this pretty interesting, even though there are some slow scenes, which includes nearly all the love scenes. Here the dialogue and music become a bit artificial. The music is elsewise incredibly well composed by Danny Elfman. Combined with the scenography, you get a lot of great action scenes, which actually are the only things that make the film worth watching. My total impression is that I have seen it all before. If you don't manage to swallow all the nationalism and moral preaching, I recommend that you see something else. The majority of people, who lack the ability to think critically, will love this movie. Rating: 5/10
6.0~What a hype bsinc Sign in Permalink It's a usual procedure to compare newly spawned comic-book based movies with Burton's "Batman" and rightfully so as it is only a small step away from perfection. After doing just this I came up with the following: THE COSTUMES: Spidey's is great but the Goblin really does look like a badly done creature from the Power Rangers THE MUSICAL THEME: As far as I'm concerned one of the most important parts of a comic-book based movie. Well I didn't really expect Elfman to surpass his Batmen theme, but the music in "Spidey" is hardly ever noticeable and besides sounding very similar to much of his previous work, lacks in atmosphere and should have been much more powerful and striking. One of Elfman's worst. THE BIRTH OF A SUPER HERO: They wanted to show how "Spidey" came to be and I have no real complaints except for not making the most of it. The most enjoyable part of this movie for me was the part where Peter Parker is discovering his super powers. This movie was intended as the first of many so why didn't they take some more time to explore his newly given strenghts as they sure won't be able to do so later. THE VILLAIN: Oh please, anybody can wear a mask, if they decided to go for the cheap, move-free mask they could have at least made it cooler looking. Dafoe didn't do it for me, he seemed to weak and sympathetic-looking to be a worthy, let alone dangerous opponent. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS: They sucked in the trailers, they sucked in the movie. Some unnecessary scenes like the one where Parker is jumping from rooftop to rooftop are so bad I couldn't believe my eyes. There are some nice moments in the movie, no doubt, but even "Superman(1978)" , and notice the year of release made me want to fly. Spiderman made me want to kick the s..t from all those special effects "artist" because they did such a low standard job. THE ACTION: To be honest I don't really remember any good action parts since they were all ruined by the special effects. Mediocre at best. THE FEMALES: I don't find Kirsten Dunst to be very attractive, but she did an OK job. But I liked the kissing scene. Aunt May doesn't look like she's going to make it to the sequel. THE REST OF THE CAST: J.K. Simmons is the only one worth mentioning for his portrayal of the ever cynical and spider-hating Jonah Jameson. He looks exactly like his character in the comics and the cartoon. It's one of those lucky casting marvels(like Hugh Jackman's Wolverine) AND THE FRIENDLY NEIGHBOURHOOD HIMSELF: Well, Maguire's not bad at all, but as soon as an emotional scene arises I knew exactly why many people thought he was a mistake. He just looks so passive all the time and he has the most ridiculous cry, but I like his goofie scenes and expressions. Oh well, we're stuck with him for some time. I guess I didn't really compare "Spidey" with "Batman", but all those enthusiastic Spidey fans would probably be furious if I did because it would be tough to spot a positive quality. ANYWAYS, THE FINAL VERDICT: Although possessing some nice moments(all in the first half of the movie, where Parker is exploring himself) the movie lacks a solid (PG-13 free) script(and none of those "We'll met again, Spiderman" or "You're out Goblin, out of your mind". It's just not necessary!!!). I liked Raimi's "Darkman" much better, with all those cheesy effects and everything, because it had heart. "Spiderman" could have been spectacular, but wound up being a mediocre summer disappointment that earned itself over 400 million US dollars. 6/10
8.0~"Good,but not great" mjensen-3 Sign in Permalink After viewing "Spider-Man 2", I'd discovered that it was POINTLESS to create the first Spider-Man film. This film has many powerful scenes, the death of Uncle Ben, Spider-Man defeating The Green Goblin, and the final scene when Peter Parker tells Mary Jane that he can't be with her. THE WEEKEND THAT MADE HISTORY In the summer of 2002 I watched every trailer of "Spider-Man". It was a great summer, women, going to high school, but I was afraid that "Spider-Man" would tank, and people would hate it and it would be the most controversial film ever, why was Sam Raimi directing this film, why was Tobey Maguire playing "Spider-Man". This didn't make any sense, Tobey Maguire is a dramatic actor, not an action hero. My cousin and I were thinking this film is going to suck, why didn't James Cameron take a chance to make this film, besides he wanted to write and direct "Spider-Man" ten years ago. Oh I forgot, he hasn't directed a film in 8 or 7 years, and it still seems that James is still in love with himself, I mean he's achieved everything that he ever wanted to achieve in cinema. Steven Spielberg, now there's a great director, "The Color Purple", "Shindler's list", what a director, HE'S Achieved EVERYTHING, and changed cinema forever. But there's A.I., that film wasn't a disappointment, but who can trust Spielberg now, he may kill Spider-Man by probably the third film, who knows. Martin Scorsese, well he would probably put gangster's in "Spider-Man" and that wouldn't be pretty. My cousin and I were contemplating until we had no choice but to wait and see for ourselves. 114 million dollars I took my mom to Regal Cinemas, and it was a great day, it reminded me of the day I saw "Jurrasic Park", and "Titanic", that peaceful silence, I couldn't even speak, I was so nervous that this film would suck. In fact I was begging it to suck, I expected Maguire and Raimi to fail. My mom and I got there three hours before the movie started, the longer we stood there, the more the line got longer and longer, and longer. I saw people that were my age and baby-boomers that had waited for "Spider-Man" to come to the big screen. I walked in the movie and I was surprised, I was actually happy to see a film, I hadn't felt that way in years. I sat in my seat, the lights got dimmed and the film began. After about 2 hours, I realized this was an incredible film, I said that at the time, but after seeing the sequel, "Spider-Man" was just an action film, there was no plot, I already knew the story. "Spider-Man 2" was a crowning achievement, it will set the new generation of superhero films, and now I'm looking forward to "Batman Begins" cause I want to know more about Batman than any other superhero. "Spider-Man" made 114 million dollars in three days and it grossed 403 million dollars in its total run. I think the "Spider-Man" saga will probably end up like "Harry Potter", the darker the saga gets, the less money the saga makes. Roger Ebert's view of this film was false, this was just the tip of the ice berg, it was setting you up for the epic fights in the sequel and the dramatic scenes that have even surpassed "Superman", and will change cinema forever. PS: I was wrong about Tobey Maguire, he's gonna be the best Spider-Man until he reaches age 50. I give this film ***1/2(out of 4 stars).
9.0~Great! Dragonsouls Sign in Permalink This movie was so cool to watch, unlike Blade 2, Spiderman had a great story backed by good acting and I cared for the characters. It was a little emotional too!! I couldnt beleive how great this movie turned out to be! I can't wait for the sequel, I wonder who the new villain will be?? VENOM????? DR.OCTOPUS?? give spidey some new weapons too, he isn't as versatile as Batman is with his vehicles and cool gadgets. Webs and crawling on walls could get boring to watch after 2 movies. But man was Spiderman a classic that stands up to Superman, Batman and the X men flicks.
9.0~Spectacular Spider-Man Movie Falcon-51 Sign in Permalink A few liberties were taken with the origin of the web slinging hero, but a dated character will need a little help making it in today's world. This created a modern day Spider-Man that took block-buster to a whole new level, shattering box office records in it's opening week. Adults and kids alike could finally experience a big screen adventure with Spider-Man. He's a character that's been in comic books for decades. It even crossed gender lines as many girls flocked to the theater, perhaps because of the kookie little love story. Spider-Man's CO-creator Stan Lee had a cameo in the film. The special effects were great and the action was almost nonstop. Don't analyze the movie just enjoy it. Millions of dollars in sales can't be wrong. Lets hope the sequels turn out to be half as good. Superman and Batman were products of DC Comics, Marvels biggest competitor. Did anyone notice that only the 1st Superman and 1st Batman films were really big hits and their sequels all were huge disappointments? Hopefully this curse will not befall the Amazing Spider-Man. Spidey has a few things going for him though. First of all he is Marvel's flagship character and not to take anything away from DC, but Marvel super villains have always been a whole lot cooler. Second advances in special effects can do almost anything today so we can expect to see spidey do a lot of really neat stuff. Finally Tobey McGuire actually looks like Peter Parker making him a perfect fit. Batman suffered changes in 3 lead actors throughout 4 movies which got consistently worse and none resembled Bruce Wayne the man behind the mask. Spider-Man appears on the screen exactly the way you would expect him to be in the comics. They captured that image perfectly. The liberties I already mentioned, work a lot better in an updated version recreated for the BIG screen. This must be Marvel's decade as we await more super powered action flicks such as, The Incredible Hulk, X-2 and sequels to Spider-Man. Keeping comics cool with movies is a great way to enjoy your favorite childhood super-heroes all over again!
8.0~Raimi's best SPIDERMAN was this one! hnt_dnl Sign in Permalink In reality, despite what WAY TOO MANY people say, Sam Raimi's original SPIDERMAN (2002) film is the best that he did. SPIDERMAN 2 just plain sucked! It did...It really did! SPIDERMAN 3 was not as bad as people say and had a much more "entertainment" factor going for it than 2 ever did. But this first SPIDERMAN, flaws and all, is the best of the lot b/c Raimi kept it, in a word...simple! It flowed much more easily and didn't have stalls in action or plot like both of its sequels did. In SPIDERMAN, the action actually comes from the plot rather than defines it. SPIDERMAN tells the tale of Peter Parker (solid performance by Tobey Maguire), a meek, smart New York City high-schooler who is about to graduate with his best friends Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and Harry Osborn (James Franco); Maguire, Dunst and Franco are fresh young faces and nice choices for these roles. Mary Jane aka MJ is the object of Peter's affection and Harry is Peter's secret ally for MJ's love. Also, Harry is jealous of Peter because his wealthy father Norman (the great Willem Dafoe) respects Peter more than him. Peter has science acumen (physics his major when he graduates) and had to work hard to support himself, whereas Harry had everything handed to him on a silver platter, so there is underlying tension between the two boys. Peter lives with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben (distinguished film veterans Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson). Norman is the head of Oscorp, whose primary division is R&D. He is tasked by the military to build a supersuit for human enhancement, but when better bid comes along a rival corporation to develop the technology, Norman (in disguise wearing the outfit he was developing for the military) attacks their lab and kills the general in charge Slocum (Ron Perlman). Now Oscorp has regained control, but later, the other corporation after recouping its losses is big enough to buy out Oscorp and when Norman's board agrees with it, he goes insane and vows revenge and wreaks havoc on NYC as The Green Goblin. Meanwhile, Peter has been bitten by a radioactive spider on a field trip and sees that he has developed amazing abilities (web-shooting, buidling-scaling, super strength). At first, he uses it for silly things like impressing MJ and his fellow high-schoolers and also he goes out one night to an amateur wrestling match to try to win money to buy a car to impress MJ further. Dressed in a spider costume, Peter wins, but when the event organizer won't pay him, Peter rebels by refusing to stop a thief who stole all the money from the office safe. Ironically, Peter finds out later that night that this thief killed his Uncle Ben during the police chase, so Peter goes after him, finds him, and accidentally kills him. In the ensuing months, Peter's guilt and agony turn to productivity as he vows to fight crime under the mantra "Spiderman". During this time, the 3 friends have graduated high school and Peter enrolls at NYU majoring in physics, MJ pursues a career on Broadway, and Harry goes to work for his father and is set to become his heir. Suffice to say, Spiderman and the Green Goblin square off and in the end, Spidey prevails, but not before Harry finds out that his dad was the villainous Goblin. Harry vows to avenge his father's death, aka SEQUELS! The biggest issue I have with these SPIDERMAN films is Peter's borderline obsession with MJ, who I find to be a very "loose woman". She bounces from boyfriend to boyfriend way to easily! Peter should take that into account in his assessment of whether or not she is the right woman for him to spend the rest of his life with! What makes SPIDERMAN a solid comic book tale is that Raimi does a find job balancing the stories of it's main characters lives and has just enough action at the right moments, but it never quite devolves into the sappiness or stops dead in it's tracks, like both of it's sequels did, esp. SPIDEY 2! The acting is good, especially by Dafoe, and the ending scenes are especially powerful with a really memorable, emotional ending. A solid entry to the comic book movie fold!
7.0~Worth seeing once (if there's anyone out there that hasn't seen it already) spyder7 Sign in Permalink First off, I just have to say that nobody should tell you what a movie is supposed to be or meant to be. A corollary to that however, is that we all come into each movie with different expectations. Personally, I expected a huge blockbuster (which it was), while sticking to the quality I feel that Batman (1989) had. Unfortunately, I think the quality was lacking in several areas. First off, the acting was sub-par to me. My expectations, like all of you, get me into trouble here. I have always admired Dafoe's work, but he didn't seem at all comfortable in this role (and no, I really don't think I was typecasting him in my own mind). Toby was fine, but that's it. Dunst seemed to be overacting or something...I couldn't really tell. The script (dialogue) was bad period. Yeah, comic books usually are comprised of elementary dialogue but this was an insult even so. Obviously, you can't give the movie any credit for plot, twists, or cool self-referential themes since it's based on a prior work. The CGI was bad, see Attack of the Clones or LoTR for what they SHOULD have done with the computer graphics. The mood and tone throughout was decent, but Batman was better (credit Burton). The pace of the movie and the action, which is what I was so excited about, really didn't do it for me. Again, Attack of the Clones blew this movie out for pace and action. Okay, it's not fair to compare the two on that note, but I was expecting something more towards what I eventually saw in Attack of the Clones. It was worth seeing, but I won't be buying it and won't be seeing it again. Love you all!
9.0~Swinging into Action CrowBat2005 Sign in Permalink "Spider-Man! Spider-Man! Does whatever a spider can!" You know the song; you know the costume; you know the name. The comic book is brought to life in Sam Raimi's wonderfully fulfilling movie adaptation of the web slinger. Fans should not be disappointed with Peter's younger age: it's modern, right? Everything's hectic when you're a teenager, and you don't need to be a superhero to feel that way. Tobey Maguire makes a wonderful Peter Parker and an "amazing Spider-Man." He certainly makes the viewer feel Peter's dilemmas of his role conflicting life. But with every hero, you'll find a villain, and Willem Dafoe rises to the occasion playing the green clad rogue. He gives an outstanding performance as he allows the viewer to explore his inner psyche. Of course, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco didn't disappoint playing Peter's closest friends. You feel at the end of this movie, a sequel or two is something to highly look forward to with the high standard that is set.
7.0~Very, very good schultzclan6 Sign in Permalink After James Cameron was rejected for Spider-Man, everything with Spider-Man seemed a bit quiet. Sam Raimi revived him. Tobey Maguire stars as our hero, Kirsten Dunst as his love, and Willem Dafoe as his nemesis...the Green Goblin. David Koepp, a writer of thrillers, penned the script and did a good job. Peter Parker is a student struggling with friends, when he is suddenly bitten by a radioactive spider. He begins to change, and then his life changes when his uncle is murdered. He then dedicates his life to fighting crime. But is Spider-Man any good? It certainly is. Spider-Man does not have the average feel most superhero films have. Most superhero films, like X-Men and Superman, do not show any sign that this stuff can happen in real life. Although we all know that Spider-Man cannot exist in real life, you still feel the possibility of him truly existing. The film is mild-mannered, with the perfect balance of lighter scenes and darker scenes. The actors are outstanding and you can feel an emotional pull in you during some of the sadder scenes. The film's photography also has what I call a very "70's feel", so it doesn't look very modern but it doesn't look old either. While the film does great on all of this, it has a couple of flaws. Spider-Man includes some scenes that seem rather pointless or just randomly put-together, such as when the Green Goblin attacks J. Jonah Jameson, or whenever Green Goblin talks to his alter ego in the mirror. The second fight between Spidey and GG occurs so quickly and randomly, but it does foreshadow the third fight on the Queensboro Bridge. The fight on the Queensboro Bridge is the best Spider-Man fight scene, with the train fight in the sequel in second. It is my second favorite superhero scene ever, only beat by a scene in Batman Begins where the Scarecrow sets Batman ablaze. Those randomly put-together scenes don't fit comfotably in the rest of the film, and they take away from a great movie on the verge of sinking to being good, leaving the movie somewhere between good and great. Other than that, the film is just such a classic not even I can believe a film could be so well-done. It is the start of a great series, one that does not disappoint! 7.5/10
1.0~Could have been better projectorlover Sign in Permalink First of all I would like to say that this animosity between Star Wars fans and Spiderman fans is reaching the ridiculous level.Both are going to make more money then god. I really didn't like Tobey Maguire in this. He never convinced me. Spiderman is a little too perfect for my liking. Whereas Batman was cool because he was vulnerable to an extent. William Dafoe was good, but the costume was just too cheesy which destroyed this villian. The score was ok, but not up to Elfman's normal standard. The effects well, let's not go there. I can understand the hype. It doesn't mean I have to agree with it. Batman was much better. Even X men was much better. With a doubt Hulk will be better(and more interesting as a character) then this.
6.0~The curse of Marvel Movies has ended! Phil_H Sign in Permalink I said to myself, "Self, this movie better be better than any of the previous Marvel crud." "You said it," came the reply. I wasn't long in discovering that this movie does live up to the hype, and that Spider-Man is a worthy summer blockbuster, what's more there *WILL* be sequels, you can believe that, True Believers. Is this the best it could have been? Well, no. Because the sappy ending seemed tacked-on (I bet you've read that before someplace.) And some of the action editing was a bit glaring, and I could tell when the Spider-Man was CGI and not a human... But still, the curse is indeed over. This movie rocked. If you're a Spider-Man fan, you'll love the integration; if you have no clue who Spidey is, then you'll learn and you'll love him. This is good stuff. I had misgivings that Tobey McGuire would be bad, that he wouldn't make me think he was Peter Parker. But actually, he did ok. I was concerned that he might not be animated enough to pull off the wise-cracking web-slinger. But he kind of grows into the role, as if Peter's new-found confidence is letting him take off a bit more. I see that as a positive thing. Go see Spider-Man, it's good. I give it a solid "6."
5.0~Not overly impressed. pscofe Sign in Permalink I wasn't particularly impressed with this film. I felt it was too hyped up by he media and it failed to live up to all expectations. Toby Maguire is an average actor and think he was lucky to get this part. The plus side of it all is that it's set up the story now and hopefully the sequel will be a lot more entertaining and have more action.
8.0~Here's thoughts after one viewing (bound to change) Mr. Pulse Sign in Permalink Spider-Man fans will like Sam Raimi's Spider-Man; in translating the comic to the screen he's done little more than take the best parts of forty years of history and plastered it onto a movie screen for two hours. For die-hards, the best part is the perfect tone and great characters. Newcomers will enjoy the great visuals and Maguire's fantastic portrayal of everyman Peter Parker. It's a fun movie. Readers will know the story, and those who don't will be able to predict most of the twists anyway. Peter is a likeable, shy nerd with a crush on the (literal) girl next door Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). He's bitten by a genetically engineered spider just as he makes his first advances toward MJ. As Peter tests out his new powers, his classmate's father, Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), is performing his own experiments, using a vague strength-enhancing serum on himself with rather nasty results. The two gain alter-egos and are brought into colorful conflict. In any movie like this, the special effects are bound to hog the spotlight, but Maguire and the supporting cast do a wonderful job of making you care about the people surrounded by the explosions and spandex. Dafoe's Green Goblin is clearly in the vain of Jack Nicholson's Joker but Dafoe manages to give a memorable turn as the more human half of his character. Dunst as Mary Jane is great at subtly showing you the stuff going on behind her initially giggly facade. And J.K. Simmons steals all his scenes as Daily Bugle chief J. Jonah Jameson. If any character is the complete essence of his comic book counterpart, its Simmons as JJJ. Like the rest of Raimi's best work, the camera in Spider-Man is completely unchained; it follows him through the air, out of windows, dive bombing with a joy that translates beautifully on the screen. Some shots of Spider-Man in action are, for a long-time fan, breathtaking. Raimi as director was a bold choice that really pays off. His handiwork is all over the film; devotees will recognize touches from Darkman and Army of Darkness among others. The movie works for the same reasons the comic works. Some people might not like the frenetic changes of pace and tone but it's a touch right out of comic books, where pathos, action, and comedy mix every twenty-two pages. The movie hits all the right notes until it pauses after the conclusion of Spider-Man's origin. It loses some steam in its middle third, before it cranks up the juice for a great climax and a perfect epilogue that summarizes all that is great about Peter Parker: no matter his successes as Spider-Man, he will always be deficient as Peter Parker and vice versa. Throughout, the movie has the guts to remain true to the character, both in the costume and out. And they don't even use the silly cartoon theme song.
8.0~A Really Good, But Not Quite Great, Superhero Movie TheMovieDoctorful Sign in Permalink Let me get this out of the way; I LOVE Spider-Man. Spider-Man has been my favorite superhero since I was 10 years old, mainly due to his extreme relatability and his sheer selflessness as a character. And, as you may have guessed, I do think the original Sam Raimi "Spider- Man" is a very, very good movie. That said, I don't think it's a GREAT movie. I don't think Marvel would give us any GREAT movies until 2003 when we got "Daredevil" and "Ang Lee's Hulk" (And I know that it's extremely controversial and perhaps unwise for me to say that, but that is my honest opinion), and while there IS a great movie buried deep in here, there are is one BIG problem that keeps it from being great. That problem is the romance. This film tries to make the romance the heart and soul of the movie, but when the two leads have so little chemistry and so little reason to truly be in love, you're in big trouble. Such is the case with Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker and Kristen Dunst's Mary Jane Watson. Mary Jane is a very unlikable character here to be perfectly honest; she's unsupportive, weak in her convictions and honestly seems to mess with Peter a fair amount, even if not intentionally. And of course, she is quite possibly the biggest damsel in distress in comic book movie history. She's not so much a character as a plot element inserted to help PETER develop. To be fair though, Peter isn't much better. Throughout the film I am completely stumped as to why he loved Mary Jane apart from her beauty. There is simply no other reason for him to be attracted to her, and it makes Peter seem very shallow romance wise. The effects are also EXTREMELY dated too. When I was watching Spider-Man swing across New York, I didn't feel like I was watching a real superhero. I felt like I was watching a cut scene from an Xbox 360 game. That said, if the romance had been executed better, this would truly be a great superhero movie. Apart from a mediocre Kristen Dunst (And her performance is NOT her fault. The script simply gave her nothing to work with), most of the acting is good. Tobey Maguire is fairly on and off. He perfectly captures the awkwardness and geekiness we know and love in Peter Parker, and he can really give us some true emotional depth in the more touching and tragic scenes of the movie, but he never really gives the alter-ego of Spider-Man much personality. And, of course, he has no chemistry with Kristen Dunst. I'd give his performance a B; not anything mind-blowing, but decent. Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris and Willem DaFoe are all fantastic in their roles; I can't imagine anybody more perfect for the roles of Uncle Ben, Aunt May and Green Goblin, it was like watching the comic book characters come to life. For a die-hard Spidey fan like me, it was a riot to watch them breathe so much life into these roles. Then of course, there's J.K Simmons as J.J Jameson...What can be said about this performance that hasn't already been said? At the end of the day, all I can tell you is this; there's a reason why Spider-Man fans want him to come back as J.J in the new "Spider-Man" films. Simmons alone was born to play this role. The pacing is some of the best I have ever seen in an action or superhero movie. There is not a single moment in "Spider-Man" where you will be bored or disinterested, it's very fast paced and does a perfect job of grabbing and holding onto your attention in both action and character development. Sure, Mary Jane doesn't really develop much beyond crushing on Peter, but Peter's transition from immature teenager to selfless guardian of New York is handled very well, and Norman Osborne's descent from well-intentioned scientist to schizophrenic madman is tragic, terrifying and captivating all at once. The action sequences are all spectacular, feeling extremely source to the source material in style and choreography without coming across as goofy or over the top. And lastly, the musical score. Danny Elfman's "Spider-Man" score is rousing, exciting and truly iconic to a Spidey fan like myself. It's impossible for me to listen too without smiling, and it really captures the tone of the movie and character perfectly. "Spider-Man" is a really good movie, but I'm not quite willing to call it great. Yes, I do have only 2 criticisms of the movie, and only one major, but the fact remains that when the romance is the heart of your story, you damn well better make it work. And "Spider-Man" really, really doesn't. However, the movie get's nearly everything else right, from MOST of the character development, to the casting, to the action, to the score, to the pacing...Yeah, it's still a really good movie. I personally just don't think it was GREAT. Now the SEQUEL on the other hand...
9.0~Best Comic To Movie Film EVER thegodcomplex Sign in Permalink The summary above pretty much sums it all up. If you're a comic book fan, then set aside your preconceptions and go with this film. It is EXTREMELY faithful, perhaps as faithful as it could possibly be considering how convoluted the comic book history of Spider-Man has become. Yes, there are some origin changes but within the confines of what they did here it works better than a simple copy and paste from the comic could have done. Rated a 9 out of 10 by yours truly...buy the DVD, you will NOT be disappointed.
10.0~Breath taking ,inspiring,just in all..AMAZING movie! Cuddleboo21 Sign in Permalink I am young,but mature and quite wise for my age..and am a total movie lover.Movies have helped me through a lot of tough times because they are a temporary escape from the life that you live,and they allow you to do the unthinkable..they allow you to for a few hours life in another world.in another dimension..to look at life through someone else's eyes.And right now I'd definitly have to say is the toughest time in my life i've gone through,and I've seen spiderman 4 times now,evry time was better than the last.As a matter of fact,I just got home from the theatre a few moments ago!I just would like to say that spiderman is the most intensly awe'ing movie I have seen,it truly takes my breath away and touches my heart.The special affects are so amazing it makes me feel like for a little while,i am spiderman! And Toby Maguire is just amazing in this film..he made me laugh,he made me cry..he made my heart race..wow! Kirsten Dunst was awesome also!They did WONDERFULY together..Well I guess that's all I'll say,or i'll go on all day! GO SPIDER-MAN!
10.0~Worthwhile effort -- see it twice imdb-507 Sign in Permalink Plot, character development, action, cinematography, casting, special effects - these are some of the elements, when done right, that are traditionally associated with an entertaining movie. Spiderman comes to the theaters with high expectations from old-school comic book Spider Man fans, and for the rest of us, it comes with that same baggage. The story has most of the elements that make the best movies tick, character development sufficient to make you identify with the main characters, a love story that goes achingly unrealized for much of the movie, a story line that while starting somewhat implausibly soon has enough drive to keep your disbelief suspended, and finally action and special effects sequences that were eye-popping, eye-candy, turbo-charged - in short, state of the art, and done in a way that looked real in a way that many pictures have been unable to capture. The movie had very few spots that dragged, and had me totally absorbed for the vast majority of time. It was also not as violent as you might expect, and used violence to propel the story forward, and never without reason or relevance to the storyline. In the end, it followed a typical comic book ending in that the setup is perfect for a sequel. On the other hand, the ending was rewarding and tied up most of the loose ends created during the rest of the movie. In short, this movie is extremely good, 9 stars. I predict that this movie will gross in the top 5 movies of all time! See it and see it again. A great show.
10.0~Excellent! One of the best movies I have seen this year! moviemachine Sign in Permalink "Spider-Man" is one of the best movies of 2002! Tobey Maguire stars as young man who got bitten by a radioactive spider and becomes Spider-Man to fight villians. The film co-stars Kirsten Dunst, Willem Dafoe, James Franco, J.K. Simmons, Cliff Robertson, and Rosemary Harris. "Spider-Man" is a must-see for any Marvel Comic or movie fans. If you like Marvel Comics, you'll definitely like this movie! 10/10
8.0~Amazing..... tanis_38 Sign in Permalink I thought Spider-Man was awesome! I think it is - without a doubt - the best comic book movie made so far. Tobey McGuire was the perfect Peter Parker, I can't think of anybody else that could have been better suited for the role. I liked the fact that the movie dedicated a lot of time to the human aspect of the story, building the characters and such. It could have easily skimmed through the origin, had him become Spider-Man and filled the rest of the movie with straight action sequences, but it didn't. I loved the parts when Peter was discovering his powers, I could have watched 30 more minutes of that. Story wise, I have no complaints. I felt the movie moved along well enough and the great performances kept the slower scenes from going too stale. And aside from the organic web shooters it stayed pretty faithful to the comics. I like the little reference to Dr. Connors (The Lizard) which they threw in for the fans. As to the technical part of the film....well, first, I'm still not a fan of this Green Goblin outfit, even though it actually didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. But in some of those close-ups the mask looked really, really cheap. Like those plastic masks that you wear with a rubber-band. It would be interesting to see some of the other costume designs which they went through, and why they decided to go with this one. Now, Spider-Man's costume was freakin' awesome! I couldn't have imagined it to look any cooler than it did. I remember before this movie was being made I would wonder how they would make the costume in a live action movie without it looking ridiculous, 'cause in the comics it's really just a spandex skin-tight costume, and that would look really dorky in real life. But man, they nailed it! It looked great. As to the special effects, I felt they could have been better, but considering the complexity of the shots, I felt they more than got the job done. Seeing Spidey swinging around, while it didn't photorealistic, it certainly looked as I've pictured it in my mind reading the comics. Me - being the huge Spidey fan that I am - just had a huge smile on my face throughout the entire movie. **possible spoiler ahead*** And once I saw the scene when he's chasing down Uncle Ben's killer in the car (the best sequence in the movie in my opinion) I just knew the movie was going to be alright. **end spoiler** That scene just nailed it for me, and brought back so many memories of the comics. I think Sam Raimi did an outstanding job. This movie could have easily been a total mess, and I feel he brought the audience a great origin flick, with heart, solid performances, and great action sequences.
7.0~A Webslinging Adventure: Good, Mediocre? You Decide... MercurioKnight Sign in Permalink Ok, I know you all have probably rushed out to the 100mil dollar 3 day opening Spiderman, so, here are my thoughts. First, I'd like to say I did enjoy it as a comicbook film, it was fun, even if cliched, and well casted. Tobey McGuire is just perfect as Peter Parker, there's an innocence to him, an unassuming quality that he brings to the role, much like his roles in Wonder Boys and Cider House Rules, both movies of which I love. Then there's Kirsten Dunst, as the attractive red-headed Mary Jane. I thought she did an adequite job of the part, providing the 'heroine in distress' number for Spiderman to rescue, and an 'unreachable' number for Peter to gawk at and fawn over. Oh, and then there's William Dafoe, good ol' Dafoe... I can't say I have any reservations about him in much else except the cool what if making of story, Shadow of the Vampire. But here, in Spideyworld, I felt he plays the part well. Ok, now, what I liked about the film was it did manage a pure comicbook fantasy and for that, it remains an entertaining piece of the new marvel crop of their comicbook revolution that began with Blade and X-Men, but, there's also some problems with the direction they chose. Namely, I've seen this story before, not just in the comicbooks, no, but in the last animated series of Spiderman of the 90s. This means very little was actually new, just a retelling, or a remake, if you will. It's not just that, but how closely it comes to it, it just feels like I've already been here before, with a few variances. I mean, it can be, in a sense, good or bad. The Green Goblin's story is much the same as it was in the animated series as well, though more spread out over the season. This is a live action version, which I enjoyed, but I would have personally rather had something more original and maybe dealt with the origin in a short flashback sequence. Now, my other minor problems came with the design for the Goblin's mask, which is fine when he's flying around, but up close, was hard at first to get used to. Course, once I did, then everything was fine. On the other side of the coin, however, the Spidey suit was excellent in every regard; perfect, for lack of a better word. It doesn't look ridiculously like a man in tights, it actually looks like a cool suit of a comicbook hero and the way it blends in with the CGI varient was pretty nice. Everything is well laid out for the most part, but another issue I'd like to mention is Green Goblin's lack of direction in the 2nd half. After he got what he wanted, his motivations didn't seem as thought out. I think another minor plotline inbred within the story that could have lasted the whole of the movie and giving him more of a purpose at the end besides just making Parker miserable, would have helped the movie as a whole feel more complete. Now, to wrap up... I can't wait to see the sequel, now that the ground work has been laid out, let's see something really cool in the next one. Lots of potential here. I liked the film, and I will definitely pick it up on DVD eventually and enjoy it at home, but I still feel X-Men is a better marvel superhero comicbook flick, in my opinion.
7.0~A worthy adaptation Mr-Fusion Sign in Permalink Part of appreciating Sam Raimi's "Spider-Man" is understanding its role in the Hollywood superhero boom of the last fifteen years. But on its own terms, what it really does right is the balance between morality and superpowers; the give-and-take of Peter Parker's crushing burden and those thrilling scenes of swinging through the city. That's what really stands out to me today (that, and J.K. Simmon's pitch-perfect casting as J. Jonah Jameson, who owns every one of his scenes). Not all of it works - the story is a bit drawn out and the dialogue scenes between Maguire and Dunst are marshmallowy soft - but it's a perfectly decent treatment of Spidey. And these days, I still watch it with the firmly-imprinted memory of its success in 2002. The genre landscape was entirely different back then, and a Spider-Man movie wasn't a sure thing. Raimi was a genuine surprise as director, but he produced a film that retained the vibrancy of its source material and populated it with grounded characters. And the timing really helped; it ended up being an anthem for a post-9/11 New York. In other words, it was a breath of fresh air. 7/10
3.0~A Great Disappointment rsmolin Sign in Permalink Yes, I know, most people liked this film, and from a big screen, theater experience, I suppose the graphics are excellent; but from a story--yuk. Mushy romance, a silly adversary, typical bad guy scenes, a rather boring plot --a great disappointment. The best sequence is a very brief wrestling match, but from then on it goes downhill. I suppose this is a great kid movie, but for adult movie-goers, prepare to be let down.
10.0~I LOVE this movie!!!!! Greengoblinlover Sign in Permalink Don't read this unless you've seen the movie, contains spoilers!!!!!! This movie rocks!! Sam Raimi did a wonderful job on Spider-man. I came out of the theater with only one or two complaints. A much more faithful adaption than the X-men movie did with its comic predecessor. The acting was very convincing, especially Willem Dafoe. He was absolutely perfect as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. The mirror scene gave me goosebumps. I'm one of the few people I know of that liked Tobey Maguire as Peter/Spiderman. I do wish he'd been more sarcastic, but that was as much the script's fault as his. James Franco was good as Harry, I can see him taking his father's place as a goblin. Kirsten Dunst was very good as Mary Jane, I really sympathized with her. The effects and action scenes were great and I LOVED the glider!!!! Great movie, again, Willem Dafoe was awesome!!!!
1.0~Spider-man far from amazing 5/10 naylor-3 Sign in Permalink Admit it. This film is terrible. How do you mess up spider man?(SPOILERS AHEAD!) So much to work with yet this 2002 flick takes all the wrong turns. I definitely agree that it is an insult to great films everywhere that this film is on the top 200 list. I've never commented on a film before but saw that it was on the list and wondered what people are thinking when they vote. Everyone deserves a better Spidey film then this trash. I'd been waiting for a Spider-Man movie since I was about six years old, in the mid 80's, and was there on opening night. The film started off well but quickly went down hill. I almost left half way through but kept hoping it would get better. The CG effects were way over done. Film makers today treat this stuff like heroin. They start using it and can't seem stop. Enough with all the digital effects. Why don't film makers (especially George Lucas) realize half of this stuff doesn't look real at all and ruins these movies. The dialogue, story, and action were all terrible in this film. Peter Parker tells Mary Jane he'll always be there for her, and then leaves her standing alone...IN A GRAVEYARD! Why did Peter Parker turn into Bruce Wayne? I enjoy Super hero films (Batman, Superman etc)but they should still be decent flicks. This film was about as good as Batman and Robin, or the Mummy Returns. The casting of Willem Dafoe was great as the green goblin but why give him that terrible suite and what happened to his pumpkin bombs? Peter's Boss J.J sucked. Toby Maguire did a good job but is totally wrong for spider man. He's way too short to begin with. The old animated Peter Parker was way cooler. I'm a fan of Sam Raimi, and it was cool to see some Evil dead stuff in the film but Bruce Campbell's cameo was disappointing as he was almost unrecognizable. This movie didn't seem to know which way it was going. There were two or three cool scenes but over all this was the biggest film disappointment I've ever had. Couldn't they have stuck the Ramones Spider-Man theme in there somewhere? Couldn't Spider-man have mentioned his Spidey sence? Couldn't he have used a web net on someone? Was he a ninja? How come you never heard his web shoot when people looked away and then saw that he had disappeared? I wasn't expecting the cartoon but at least something as good. This movie hit the lowest point by using a Matrix rip off in a fight scene. This has been done a million times and it was insulting to see it again. Too bad this film was ever made. Kids deserve better films to grow up on. I think most Spider-man fans could have written a better screen play then this campy waste of time and money. Stay off the CG. Help is available.
6.0~holds a special place in my heart memebigboy-98803 Sign in Permalink Spider-man is really corny and cheesy and there are some bad scenes in the film and cg hasn't aged really well but the film has a style that makes the movie look like a comic book, toby did a good job playing as spider-man and willem dafoe as the green goblin is great in thats movie, the film develops peter and harry relationship and it changes over the movie, mary jane was just a boring love interest but i like that peter reject her so theres that, overall its an enjoyable fun movie
7.0~One small step for X-Men. One giant leap for Spider Man. Man_of_Death Sign in Permalink This is the second time I write a review about Spider Man. The first one did not reach their data-base on May 3rd. Spider Man is a great film, everything is great except the screenplay. The screenplay fills the movie with cliches, but enjoyable cliches. In my case I think the script is the weakest part of the film. Spider Man is better than X-Men which I did not expect because X-Men was terrific. But Spider Man is the best movie of the year. Our next topic: Star Wars Episode II: The Attack of the Clones.
10.0~The Film That Redefined Superhero Genre FilmMan47 Sign in Permalink this is the film that started & showed how true superhero movies should be made spider-man 2002 is better then the best. peter parker(Tobey Maguire) lives with his uncle Ben & aunt may goes to high school & then accident happens that changes peters life & turns him into the spider-man. the story characters & the main villain the green goblin played by William Dafoe is awesome. the success of this film spawned 2 sequels spider-man 2 & 3 . my rating is 10/10 this is one hell of a epic film.a total entertainer do not miss this adventure
7.0~An Inside Look. metal_1225_heavy Sign in Permalink To start of - I saw this movie at the cinema 2 times, and have to say that both times were as enjoyable as when i saw Spider-Man 2. Before i saw Spider-Man i was surprised (In a good way) of the actor-set. Especielly with J.K Simmons (Also actor as Schillinger in one of my favorite shows, Oz.) as Jameson, Tobey Maguire from The cider house rules and Wonder boys), and, of course - Kirsten Dunst (Remember her from the one year earlier movie Crazy/Beautiful and early years Jumanji). I've always had an appeal for long movies, and this movie is about 2 hours, (as you probably already know) and i wasn't surprised over the choosing of Villain - Green Goblin. Even tho the connection between Spider-Man the Movie and Spider-Man the Comics is very thin, its still was a great movie, one of the best I've ever seen, actually. The thing i'm missing in it was the humor that Spider-Man showed in the comics, - Now, i know that increased in Spider-Man 2 - But that's not the point. Where's the jokes? A big minus for that part. I also read that Tobey didn't even read a glimpse of any Spider-Man comic before, so i'm very, very surprised that he could act Peter Parker without even knowing his style. The 2 of them are the same (in some restrictions, that is.) Well, That's all i have to say, plus i rated the movie 9 out of 10. Cheers!
